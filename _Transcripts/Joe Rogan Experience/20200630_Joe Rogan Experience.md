# Joe Rogan Experienced #1499 - Aron Snyder
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 30, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmgYeeE31_8)
*  What's up, brother good to see you man. We finally did this. Yeah. Yeah good to see you
*  I am I I had been pestered about four million times or when you're getting on Rogan's podcast
*  I'm like, why don't you ask Rogan? I don't I don't know. So when you finally asked I'm like, whoo-hoo. I was excited
*  I feel like I've made it. Well, so many people have asked me when I've worn your shirt this people that what is this shirt?
*  This Rhino shirt. What is that? That's kefaro. That's your backpack company and
*  Because I've worn this on the podcast people
*  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure that probably gets old I am
*  Have to respect the amount of people that how many times you changed your phone number in the last ten years multiple
*  Yeah, keep it moving. Yeah
*  Gotta keep it moving. I have to copy you and I've got one tenth of the following you do
*  I just it's hard to keep keep up and people
*  Surprise how sensitive they get when you don't respond to them and it's like they get angry
*  Yeah, and I'm like man, I've had guys like I know you're not that busy. Like really you don't know
*  People get real weird with that kind of stuff when they want something, you know
*  It's like, you know, there's some people that'll text you and then if you don't text them right back
*  They'll send you question marks like question question. Yeah, come on, man
*  Yeah, it gets it's weird trying to me little than I know where I would end up in life compared
*  You know where I kind of where I started from and then now
*  What it's funny. Um, my my wife she knew me and we met in oh seven
*  Didn't have a phone no computer lived in the woods slept on a thermarest air mattress
*  You didn't have a phone or a computer in oh seven. It was bad
*  I you know what? I think I might got a flip-flown right around that time frame
*  And I was sleeping on a and this is a no bullshit story
*  She'll tell you I had gotten divorced and I kind of made this, you know do whatever I got
*  I wanted to hunt a lot get out in the woods a lot
*  So I slept on a thermarest air mattress in my you know, you bring chicks over there like fuck is this, you know
*  I just had this, you know 24 inch wide backpacking air mattress
*  I slept on that and just saved, you know money for whatever hunting getting in outdoors and then
*  She and I you know screw undated for a while and we were apart for several years and we got back together
*  She's like who the fuck are you like we're in Walmart. They're like Snyder
*  That a friend of yours
*  I'm like I have no idea who that is and she because she skipped all that time and then I'm marketing and I'm wired in
*  all the time she's like
*  Are you a different person a different body because I was not different acting
*  She just you know, she she knew me as the low tech dude that just was anti, you know
*  And so because of your podcast like and that's probably what and then gritty Bowman before that. Yeah
*  Yeah, all that stuff forums and you know, whatever all that different stuff just got well known and then yeah went from there
*  Well that world that world of outdoor
*  Enthusiasts and backpack hunters is such a rabid world the guys who are really into that for people don't understand
*  It's like if you combined ultra marathon running rucking and hunting together
*  Yeah, it's kind of all those things because it's you know
*  We've talked about it on the podcast before and I know I've brought you up before but this it's that world is it's the combination
*  Of athle like I don't like when people call bow hunting a sport
*  Because I think it's more of a discipline. It's a weird thing to call it a sport because it's not like there's a game going on
*  It's it's you're hunting an animal. Yeah, but it's a discipline. Mm-hmm, but it also requires athleticism
*  It requires the kind of workout that you know
*  I mean if you're gonna be able to make it 15 miles into the backcountry
*  With a 40 pound pack on you have to be an insane shape and you got to be able to get out
*  With an animal on your back in multiple trips. It could take you several days
*  Like the amount that just a taxing effect that it has on a human body
*  So the guys that are into that shit when they run into a guy like you that's legit. They get very rabid
*  It's crazy. It's crazy. And I mean there's that well, I would say
*  Cam kicked it off, right?
*  He was the the not the you know, people get sensitive about that
*  Cam was not the original but cam was the original that everybody knew
*  Well, and he was the guy that um, you know
*  Going back like he was the first one to promote backpack hunting with a platform like I'm not the first stick bow guy
*  Just first stick bow guy with a platform
*  You know what? I mean like I'm the first dude that shoots a recurve that you know has somewhat known work for people that don't
*  Fall hunting. Let me explain you
*  Aaron got too good at shooting with a compound bow, which is probably one of the hardest ways to hunt
*  So he decided to shoot with a fucking like a medieval bow. Let's talk about how that got started
*  So I was I was I was you in the fact I made fun of stick bow guys
*  Like I was bad like I was truly mean to him like somebody come down
*  You know
*  So for people don't understand when you go to an outdoor range
*  You've got one long line and you've got targets on the far right
*  Which is like the five pound weights at the gym and on the far left. You've got the 200 pound dumbbells
*  That's a hundred yard bail
*  So I'm over at the hundred yard bail shooting a Reinhardt 18 and 100 120
*  And I would have stick bow guys come down to me and tell me I'm unethical for shooting that distance and I would be like
*  You can't hit the bail down there at 10 yards. You're at the chumpside
*  What are you giving you know me shit for any it got to tell you you're unethical for shooting at a target
*  Yeah, you're practicing at that range. Like what were they?
*  It was weird. It was weird in it
*  Why is that the people want to do that they want to tell you what you're doing is wrong. Ah
*  I don't human nature I guess and you know, I ended up doing a podcast talked about you know
*  God forbid you break down mathematically, right?
*  You can break down the speed of an arrow and the accuracy and you take a guy, you know shooting whatever
*  290 feet per second. How long does it take his arrow to get to 80 yards?
*  How long does it take an arrow to get from you know, 170 feet per second to 35 yards?
*  So I kind of evened all that up and said well here's apples to apples oranges to oranges. This is it
*  Fuck I got hate mail. I mean
*  You're a horrible hunter. You're using your ability instead of hunting skills, you know to shoot and so I was like fuck it
*  I sold everything I had every compound every side every arrow
*  I didn't want that temptation and I'm like, I'm gonna shoot it up. We'll see right
*  I will see how good I can get cuz I never shot a stick though
*  So you just because of people's reaction to you you decided to go to a recurve bow
*  Yeah, 100% which is for people don't understand the difference
*  So this can be
*  Absorbed by people don't hunt the difference it when you have a compound bow
*  You have a sight on a compound bow that will allow you to scroll out you could roll out like so my sight is set
*  At 30 yards, that's where it's normally set at but you can go all the way to 120 yards
*  And when it does is it it raises your pin?
*  So it changes where the pin goes up and down and the pin is how you aim so you can get really accurate
*  See if you're a guy like cam Hanes, I mean he shoots at 100 yards all the time and
*  You know he can get into a small group at 100 yards John Dudley the same thing. It's very accurate
*  Whereas with a recurve bow, there's no sight
*  You're doing it with the point of your arrow and you're you have to practice much more and it's like throwing a rock
*  Like you get a thing if you throw rocks all the time. You kind of get a feel of where you can throw that rock
*  Yeah throwing that rock was a lot harder than I thought it was gonna be let me tell you so I'm very
*  goal oriented and I
*  Had a problem which is much you I don't I'm not very good at losing and I'm not saying I'm a spoiled loser
*  I'm psychotic when I lose at something like my wife will tell you I'll go to a tournament first thing
*  I do when I get home. I'm having her film me breaking down things. So I thought well
*  We're gonna see if I can if these people are right. I'm gonna I'm gonna find out
*  I'm gonna do nothing but trad and so trad meaning traditional traditional archery. Yep, and so I
*  I'm lucky enough. You fall Tom Clum, right? He's like the Yoda of traditional archery
*  So I go down there with a wad of cash and I'm like and they've got several hundred recurve
*  so I'm like, hey, I'm gonna shoot a stick bow guys and they're like
*  they've seen me shoot a comp and they're like
*  Cool, let's let's get you set up and I'm thinking I get hand-eye coordination. It shouldn't be a problem
*  Fuck man. I'm like I went from shooting 58 X's on a five spot on average
*  To I can't hit the target at 20 yards and I'm like, oh this
*  I've only shot a recurve bow a couple times
*  But I did it recently in Hawaii like last summer and they had like some range out there and they had
*  Recurve bows you could shoot it's amazing how difficult it is to hit something if you don't have any experience doing it
*  Yeah
*  Well, and I was lucky because I had that whole family there to help me right so they're you know
*  It's like you haven't Dudley and can you know, I right they took me under their wing and they're explaining this and so I got
*  What I thought was good pretty fast which 40 yards with a stick bow so far
*  But I hadn't hunted yet, you know, and so then I I go out and I don't remember I shot that black bear and
*  You know, I'm within 40 yards of it for 20 minutes and in my mind
*  You're gonna you would be so dead if I had my compound
*  I just couldn't get a shot and I finally squeaked it in missed it at like 18 yards and I'm like
*  So luckily and Tom had told me this he said you're gonna get two or three shots in the animal
*  They don't they don't hear the bow and they don't landed by its feet
*  It kind of looked around and I'm like, oh, I'm not gonna miss you again
*  She got it on the second shot and I'm like, yeah, this isn't yeah
*  I
*  Have any qualms about hunting with it like how long did it take before you felt ethical enough to hunt with it?
*  Well, I hung it within three months. Did you feel did you feel like that was a smart move?
*  Or do you feel like you rushed it?
*  Well, let me I was psychotic shooting 10 hours a day like I was shooting constantly
*  So if in I think I was fine because I had the coaching I had the help and I had the accuracy I could hit
*  I mean I was doing well
*  To what I had to compare to around me. I was like, okay, this is good
*  So I didn't feel like I went into it unethical like I couldn't hit what I was aiming at
*  But I didn't have experience and I mean you look at knowledge and wisdom right knowledge. You're reading about it wisdom
*  You're experiencing it. Well, I thought what I knew from shooting a compound
*  My hunting skills would be enough and they were I ended up shooting. I don't know 11 12 animals that year
*  But fuck man, it was like every time I went out I was learning something new and I had to totally change my hunting
*  style when you think about it from a perspective of someone who's a non hunter they
*  Question why you would want to shoot a bow and arrow in the first place?
*  Because they think that that would be less ethical than using a rifle
*  Like if you wanted to shoot something you should use a rifle you could kill it quicker. It's better
*  To go from that to a compound bow. It's like why are you doing that?
*  You know and then they realize like oh you can actually be very accurate with a compound bow
*  If you have practice, yeah
*  And if you learn how to do it correctly and you're disciplined
*  But to take it another level and to go to a recurve like that's that's where it gets to in some people's minds
*  Like are you hunting for food? Are you hunting for your ego?
*  like what are you doing like why you doing it with a recurve bow and
*  I think one of the best answers is I've ever heard from anybody is that they said
*  It is much more difficult
*  But also much more rewarding and when you're eating that animal you have this insane sense of accomplishment
*  That's actually another level past even with a compound bow. Does that make sense?
*  Yeah, and you've explained it better there than I could and I'm gonna give it a whirl
*  So I went from your side of the things making fun of everyone to being addicted to getting close
*  So now my the first year I shot a mule deer at four feet in the cliffs when I drew my bow back
*  My arrow was between its horns when I drew up Frank took photos of it
*  And it but it was one of those things where now the
*  The the reward from it like yeah that that feeling you have when you get it done is
*  Because it's much more difficult much more
*  Yeah
*  much more difficult think about like what it must have been like to be the Native Americans he was like is fucking hungry is what
*  I was like, I mean it it I have technology on my side, right? And I have a lot of finders
*  Yeah binoculars clothing right? Yeah everything and so that that year though when we were going in
*  On a lot of these animals. I was able to get
*  Couple turkeys and a cup of black bear and I shot a mule deer and that mule deer
*  Like I said when I was in those cliffs
*  My arrow was between its antlers when I drew back so I shot it at three feet and Frank crazy
*  It was crazy and that would have never happened. How did you sneak up on it like that luck and wind? Yeah, so
*  Frank
*  He he was glassing it and I circled as a pie two and a half miles around me
*  So you were above it on the cliff no, we were when I shot it I was so, you know
*  We were across from it. However far we were I mean over a mile and I looped way around and I told you know, Frank
*  I said hey when you see me just give me the you know, the touchdown and I'm above it man
*  I lost I stalked the wrong rock twice. I lost my boots, you know
*  I'm like what cuz cuz you took your shoes off to sneak in
*  Yeah, but except that sneaking in on a fucking rock, right?
*  Wasn't at the right rock and I
*  Cuz to go that far and hit the exact same spot is is difficult because I lost sight of Frank almost the whole way
*  Cuz I couldn't expose myself. So when I looped around
*  When I would see Frank he was so far away and I was so close to the rock that I thought the deer was under
*  I didn't want to make any crazy movements and then I would go back to 100 yards
*  Try and find my boots get my boots back on loop back around to try to find the spot
*  So when I finally got to the right spot Frank stood up mile away
*  Tell his hands up and I'm like, it's got to be right in front of me and I caught the top three inches of its
*  You know, it's velvet antlers sticking up and it was windy. So every gust of wind which about every 10-15 seconds
*  I took a step I got to nine yards and I grabbed a rock and threw it and
*  The mule deer everything they tell you everything you need to know in the top four inches of their antlers
*  So I'm watching those to see if he moves
*  Didn't move at all nothing through another rock nothing through another rock and I'm like
*  Explained to be will you throw on a rock to try to get this thing to stand up?
*  So you get a shot to get a shot. So you throw on a rock just to make noise
*  Yep in hopes that he just starts get a reaction. Yep, and
*  Anyway, he didn't move and I'm like I'm gonna climb on that Rockies bedded under and I mean you and talk about you couldn't
*  Have put a grease flax seed through my ass with a hammer
*  I had just started doing this and that this steer his feet from me and I got my foot on the rock
*  He was on and I'm like, I hope this you know
*  Planting off on my right foot to spring up onto this rock. I waited for a gust of wind
*  So I'm 25 seconds from me to you from this deer. He's got no idea
*  I'm there that gust of wind hit it. I pushed off and I was worried the shade they'll think it's a mountain lion
*  Pouncing on him so I could see the shade of my fat head on the back of his neck and I'm like
*  You know it it's one of the most intense moments of my life
*  You know as far as this goes and so when I went to draw I
*  Had to sweep my arrow right between his horns and drew back and shot him, you know straight down and he ran
*  50 yards and piled up when you eat that animal
*  That's got to give you this insane feeling of accomplishment. It is extremely
*  extremely rewarding to a point it's hard to explain and in words because you've
*  You've bested the animal in a lot of ways
*  With sure skill and and I'm not saying that like I'm Billy badass. I'm just saying like
*  You have snuck into its living room. There's a lot of area and you've earned it
*  Yeah, yeah, cuz it's it at the right way
*  Because I should as you know, I've shot a lot of stuff pretty far away with a compound which I'm not embarrassed of but you know
*  It's just now rather than hanging that badge of honor how well I can shoot
*  It's also you know how well I can hunt and it's been an uphill road to hoe
*  I mean there's been how often do you think about like I
*  Mean I find myself thinking about that all the time like I'm real lucky that I could buy food in a store
*  Because this this is not
*  even with a regular compound bow with a with great binoculars and
*  You know using a rangefinder and all that jazz. It's not guaranteed that you're gonna eat
*  No, do you think about that when you're hunting like what this is?
*  It must have been insane to be one of the you know, the American Indians on the plains
*  Well, and I well you had Jordan on as well
*  You know, whatever the alone guy right? That's you'd had a his eyes. I
*  Wouldn't want to go against him. I mean that dude is born to live on nothing, right?
*  so I was put things into perspective and he brought it up to was
*  When things are down right when you're mentally or whatever drained and you think about it's like
*  Alright, I chose to put myself out here
*  You know all the people before me they had to hack it out with they didn't have you know any great
*  You didn't have sit kageer. They didn't have binos. They didn't have this they didn't have that and so it helps motivate me for one
*  but I'm like
*  As weird as it sounds I think of that a lot when I'm getting my ass kicked
*  Basically, it was like if I had to live off this thing. I would have to put in that extra
*  I got they had to make their own bows
*  I'm not that live that life
*  I mean I got it on this real long kick of Native American books
*  There's a guy named SC SC Gwen and he wrote this book called
*  Empire the summer moon
*  Yeah
*  and it's all about the Comanches and you know a lot of it talks about
*  Their lifestyle and talks about the hardships that they had to go through and you know mostly
*  bow and arrow bow and arrow hunting for deer and buffalo and
*  It's just that that life must have been insane
*  But that also it also talks about one of the main characters of this woman
*  Cynthia Ann Parker who was abducted when she was nine years old and then they recapture the
*  Americans recaptured her when she was in her 30s, and she wanted to go back back
*  Yeah, she didn't want to live in in a town and live in a house, and she fucking hated it
*  it's like that life of
*  Even though it's so difficult that subsistence hunting life
*  It's it's so insanely connected
*  You're so insanely connected to the to the forest and to the woods to the animals to the just to the earth itself
*  You you are and I think on me it just I spent
*  152 hundred nights a year in the wilderness
*  For the last yeah, you probably do more than anybody that I know that's one of the reasons why I want to talk to you about this
*  And because of your you know your company
*  Kofaro which makes you know some of the this is some great backpack companies out there that make like amazing gear
*  But you guys make I mean there's no arguing. It's top of the food chain shit and
*  One of the reasons why your company makes such good backpacks is because of your experience in the woods
*  I mean you fucking live out there. Well. It's weird so when I started
*  Patrick the the owner
*  he
*  Same way right he's 80 now or however old you know 79 80
*  He was the same way as I was so when I when I started there whatever decade ago. He was um
*  I wouldn't say enamored
*  He was happy to see a younger guy they could not get out of the woods and so what was crazy
*  Where most people end up getting stuck in an office if he came in the office, and I was in there and disgruntled
*  He'd be like what are you doing? Go get your shit and get in the woods, and he would want you
*  Oh, there's no one he would make me
*  I'd be like Patrick man. We got a lot of stuff going on. He's saying and he always has glasses right?
*  He looks over the top. He's like son it can wait and I'm like okay
*  So what he wanted was a guy and he quiz you know there was a there was a long trial period to find his successor
*  Right there was a lot of questioning if we backpack in and he'd be like hey
*  Why don't you catch some fish shoot a couple rabbits and a few squirrels for dinner like all right cool
*  I do it bring him back. He might you want to clean them. I'm like yeah, I mean of course
*  I'm like I didn't know he was testing you I didn't realize it
*  I'm like yeah, and then at one point in time
*  He told me he's like you have passed the test and I'm like I've been doing this shit's birth Patrick
*  and he's like everyone says that very people have and my
*  My my background my hometowns like 200 people right I'm a logging community in Oregon. It's right off the Pacific Crest Trail
*  I mean, that's all we did I was on a trail crew team
*  Clearing off wilderness trails with a fucking cross-cut saw and a hatchet at 14 years old
*  That's what I did in the summers for money, so that's crazy different lifestyle right
*  I mean my daughter and I love my daughter to death and she'd be like dad. Did you have a job when you're my age?
*  I'm like I was running a fucking 72 inch bar still chainsaw, honey. Yeah, I had a job
*  You know and she she's I've been able to pass a lot of those things on to her
*  But it's a different lifestyle when I was in high school you could have guns in your truck
*  You take him into the principal's office
*  He'd keep him in his office and then when you got out you go deer hunting when you you know
*  And I'm not that much younger than you but a little bit. I've heard those days
*  So you know it was something you're skipping school we'd skip school to hunt
*  Well, they take off opening day. Yeah, like a national holiday almost it was a big deal and so
*  You know we didn't have any money. I was poor as a kid so we picked mushrooms chanterelles gomakatsu's morels
*  That's what I did for school clothes split firewood
*  It was a different lifestyle and so as I've gotten older
*  You know all of those things that I learned have carried on to where now I'm pretty big
*  I'm can sustain myself for on just about any what part of Oregon were you in Detroit?
*  And is that what is that Roosevelt elk country so it's east of I-25 so they're hybrids
*  Every Rocky Mountain and Roosevelt yeah, and it's so it's
*  Cam and I are right beside when I mean we're super close from our room. He's
*  45 minutes away the first bow that I got actually I was
*  13 I'd mowed lawns all summer and worked or whatever and we went to the bow rack my mom and that's just what
*  Springfield, Oregon yep
*  We drove down there, and I don't even hardly remember my mom was telling me and we bought a bow
*  And I didn't know what I was doing right um and I
*  Would say like the way that you know
*  At that time I was pissed because we'd go to football camps
*  I'd have like the poor kids stuff and whatever, but it makes you a lot better person
*  I think yeah that feeling when you're poor and you're young that's irreplaceable
*  You know I still think about when I was young like not knowing if we were gonna have enough food yeah
*  I think about that and we were on welfare when I was like seven years old
*  And I think about those days because I remember being nervous
*  That we wouldn't have enough food or people being mad at me that I ate too much
*  Yeah, I've never been mad at my kids if they eat too much. Yeah, but I remember that
*  I would get people would get upset at me if I ate too much and I remember thinking man
*  We might not have enough food, and there's like a
*  There's something that gets instilled in you when you're poor when you're young
*  There's a like a nervousness or a drive that I don't think you could replace in a kid that grows up
*  Affluent I just don't think it's possible. I would agree and I mean you you've been around all walks of life like I have myself and
*  the one thing I wouldn't take back is um
*  You know now they'll be you know of course you get successful and people are like oh, you know he's got money
*  He's got this and it's like I remember my dad he worked for the highway department
*  He was a sole provider for the family of four making like 1400 bucks a month
*  And I had a sister and you know my both my parents smoked my dad drink a lot of beers
*  So whatever that 1400 went to it was a lot less than that after those spices right and so when I needed something you
*  Had to work for it. I remember working my ass off to get a pair of Converse
*  Which was a huge deal there like 50 bucks or something where now you know my daughter
*  She works hard, so I try to instill some of those things on her
*  But I also price spoiler too much because I'm like I do not want you to suffer a struggle like I know isn't that funny
*  It's like what leads what makes people interesting
*  I always say this about my friends like all my friends that are interesting grew up fucked up all of them
*  All of them grew up in like crazy households and fucked up and and now they're just like me
*  They all like really loving parents. They love being a father
*  Yeah, and and I'm like God we're giving these kids a life that is gonna ensure. They're never gonna be interesting
*  They got for my daughter because I
*  Whatever she's five when we got divorced and on my side of things you've got backpack hunters and power lifters
*  Photographers you know team you know like a tier one group guys and Kaylee's like all walks of life
*  She speaks two and a half languages working on the third one a half
*  She's not fluent in three so I say two and a half. I don't want to say she's fluent three
*  But she's and she's shockingly
*  Caucasian and she speaks fluid fluent Spanish like literally she's from Mexico and so that kid is good to kill the house
*  Oh, it was I just hired a Kofaru
*  Because we know we have different you know people some of our sewers and things it's super handy she can speak well I
*  We've done good between my ex-wife and I because that kid budgets to a point
*  I want to choke her because we she just moved up here, and I'm like look. I'll just pay for it
*  She's like nope. I don't want any money. I'm gonna do it on my own
*  I budgeted all this and I'm like I must have done something right because I you know I would have prayed for help because I
*  Didn't have help after I think sometimes. It's just genetics, too
*  What makes a kid a kid like I have one kid that's insanely ambitious and like super hyper focused and she
*  Whatever she gets into she becomes obsessed just completely obsessed, and it's not because of want or need
*  It's just some weird drive, so it's like you know I think they call it epigenetics
*  It's something that's transmitted down from parent to the child some desire to for perfection and things
*  We should talk about that because that's interesting I brought up
*  I've never smoked weed in my life never no coke no heroin no no nothing and my dad is a huge pothead right I am
*  Incapable at losing I hate losing my dad is the most uncompetitive man you would ever meet in your life
*  Mm-hmm, it's weird something skipped it. You know what I mean like yeah, well, that's my family, too
*  My mom is like real laid-back like she's not ambitious at all
*  She's not she's just real friendly and sweet and easygoing yeah, and I've always been just
*  Psychotically driven from when I was young I remember I came home once I was running
*  in the snow
*  and I was like 16 and
*  I had run up we lived on a hill and I ran up the hill and then ran up the stairs into the house
*  And I opened the door and it's fucking snowing like crazy outside
*  She's got a cup of coffee because it's early in the morning. She was like I don't even know where you came
*  Just goes into the kitchen has breakfast I tell you what though it is good
*  You know I'm not father of the year by any means but when we do
*  You know simple things for your kid to see like we do backpack cardio and Kayleigh comes you know and she can see
*  You're giving it everything you've got you know you know what I mean they see that that shit's it's impressive
*  It's you know they learn impressionable. I guess yeah, hell yeah, they do
*  Yeah, they say like the best way a guy can be a father to his daughter is
*  to to
*  Especially like to set them up for the future is to show them
*  How they should expect to be treated and show them how you treat other people like the way you behave?
*  Around them is like what they're gonna learn yeah like being if you're respectful and friendly
*  Like the way you are that that results oftentimes better
*  For them to see then even what you teach them and tell them because what you tell them only goes so far
*  But what they see when they see you drive or driven when they see you work hard when they see you
*  Diligent and respectful and friendly that's that's what really like sinks in yeah, it's a it's work good, so I crossed my fingers
*  She's 19, so I mean I I wouldn't change anything where I was a little fuckhead when I was a kid. I was bad
*  Yeah, I was a fuckhead. I was a fuckhead for sure we were talking
*  You know where I'm from while we're bouncing around a rabbit hole that I was there's a lake
*  I live on it's like nine miles long and you're your product of what you're surrounded by so
*  You know the oh my dad and his friends. You know did not like tourists right so we would cut boats loose and
*  Push them out in the lake for all the people camping
*  Yeah, I told enough now. I can't get trouble right and dad was teaching you how to do that
*  He didn't teach that he was just constantly complaining about
*  tourists right so then we would
*  Reek havoc and then go yogi Baron. You know get camo'd up go steal everybody's beer in the middle
*  Why did he not like tourists? What was it? I don't?
*  California was probably the worst one right I mean freeing from Oregon
*  You know you from if you're from Idaho you bitch about people from Washington, right?
*  I don't you know my my world was so much different because I left at 17
*  And you know I joined the army I was in the army for a few years, and then I got out and so
*  From how I was raised to how I end up. It's just it's just different. You know I mean I'm 200 people in my hometown
*  I mean I live in Denver now for God's sake so it's big difference
*  Giant difference well, and I mean supposed social diversity as well. Yeah, I mean like
*  now I
*  From where I was to like right now the the views I was raised with and I mean everything has changed
*  You know greatly for the better. I mean I'm you look back. I mean, I'm sure you're saying thing made you
*  Know me. I mean well my dad was not exactly easy on me, but it fucking made me tougher, so yeah
*  It's weird. It's like you wouldn't want to go through it again, right?
*  You don't want to be but there's some insanely valuable lessons in that but I think you know I mean
*  I don't I don't think it's impossible to raise a good kid
*  You know if you're you're not struggling. I don't think it's impossible, but I think it's more difficult. What is that old expression?
*  It's easier for a rich man to pass through the eye of a needle than to go to heaven
*  I don't know that one think that's a an ancient biblical expression usually my things are much different than that
*  I usually get in trouble for them, but yeah that I'm sure that sounds I'm sure that
*  That makes sense. I just bust out your Copenhagen. I did am I cool to chill on here. I did
*  I have a bottle to spit it. I got this here. We're good the um how often you have to chew that shit
*  It's funny you mentioned that about can and a half a day
*  But cowboy gave me some once and I swallowed it. Oh, did you did you puke like Luke every time Luke?
*  I was a dip. Oh you manned up. I didn't it didn't even make me sick Luke puked all over yesterday
*  He just but right in the film cruiser everywhere for the tournament and Luke is just yacking like uncontrollably
*  I'm like oh good. God somebody get a camera on him Jamie thinks it's funny
*  Didn't even know you swallowed it
*  Didn't know it's unbelievable to know that like that's so disgusting. So yes, if you puked right away. Yeah, no, I didn't puke
*  Yeah, that's pretty solid. It's weird. I drank for the first time with Luke not too long ago
*  I'm drinking a couple decades and oh really what made you have a drunk told him I would
*  He said I want you to get you fucked up on my podcast that you I was his first guest and
*  but so
*  You know, you've known Luke for forever. I mean, I don't know if you
*  Quite a we should say who he is Luke Cordeo. He is involved in MMA. He's been involved in MMA forever
*  He used to be a fighter
*  Works with Justin Gagey. Yes, UFC interim
*  lightweight champion
*  Yeah, I've known a long time. He's always been around. Yeah, so we shoot archery constantly. In fact, you know for everybody listening
*  I have taken every bit of money from Luke. He's about to get divorced just to remind you of that Luke and
*  Gamble and archery. Oh my god
*  And I'm not a good guy to gamble against in archery
*  So I didn't know gambling and archery was a big deal, but it makes sense
*  It is in bowling and pool and we think about it if you have you know
*  Pick guys you get you know Dudley and cam and me and you and leave
*  I don't know if you Levi Morgan another sure probably greatest archer to ever hold a bow in his hand
*  I hunted with him in Utah last year. Yeah, it's super cool. Do we're in camp together?
*  Great guy think about the amount of money if everybody's got a few hundred in their pocket in the shit talking starts
*  Well, yeah the epic shit talker, but he does not have the skill level to back that up
*  So just let's talk shit. He does and so I go to Minda to gambling
*  So yesterday, I think he's $45 short of paying up
*  But I'm pretty sure he's about to get a divorce from gambling too much. Oh, no. Yeah, it's bad
*  Well in pool, they would always tell you that you should gamble because it'll make your game better. Hell. Yes it was
*  It's and I would imagine that that same thing would be said for
*  For shooting yeah, because you would be able to fire under pressure. Yep. Well, it's packing right now. I'm packing it
*  Yeah, I'm gonna put an upper decker an upper decker. Yeah. Do you worry about mouth cancer with that shit? I don't know Jesus Christ
*  Look at the size of that wad
*  Holy fuck dude. Oh my god
*  That was crazy. Yeah, it's worse than the bottom lip. Mm-hmm
*  I've actually started a handful of grass like you just grabbed
*  Grab some mulch. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I started chewing Zen. You seen what's that? I'm fake
*  No, it's not fake. It's strong, but it doesn't have the the carcinogens in it. What?
*  Christ may know maybe it's like Jamie. Can you look at?
*  How could they take the carcinogens? So
*  If people hear me coughing it's not the cove it folks
*  I did stand up this weekend for the first time in three months in Houston. Shout out to Houston and
*  My voice is shot from screaming. I didn't realize it but your your voice gets in shape
*  Yeah, you know and my voice is way out of shape after the first show. My voice was like a little horse
*  Did you pack the house? Yeah. Well, it's supposed to be at 75% capacity
*  I think that's what they they were they're saying it was so it was it was packed though. It was
*  There's a lot of fun man. It was weird. It was a
*  Very weird to be back on stage again a lot of fun though, but LA is bad right now
*  They just the comedy store just furloughed all of its employees. They were hoping to reopen and they had opened as a bar
*  So they had outside patio seating and they had it all set up nice social distance and everything and then the governor just came
*  Down with another order to shut all the bars down and now the comedy store has no money coming in
*  So they're fucked and then it looks like it's not gonna they're not gonna open up anytime soon
*  They were hoping to open the comedy club back up in August or July. No, that was the hope and it looks like that's not happening
*  Now so we're fucked that sucks
*  It does suck because in Texas they had it down you wear a mask people wore a mask in the audience
*  Everybody had masks like getting into the building all those servers had masks, you know
*  They check temperatures in places. They know how to keep people safe
*  You got to give people the opportunity to make their own decisions. That's my thing
*  You know, if you want to wear a mask or stay home, that's your prerogative prerogative
*  But you know, I'm not of course, you know, I'm young and healthy. So whatever I'm not worried about it
*  But you lock people in I mean, I don't see anything good coming coming out of that and I know it's not it's not good for the economy
*  It's not good for the people. It's not good for their their sense of like how they fit into the world
*  Well, and I'm kind of with you. I'm all for fat shaming or I'd be fatter than I am now if one for fat shaming
*  You're the health. I mean you think about how unhealthy people are getting just sit at home. Yes, not good
*  70% of the United States is overweight. That's insane
*  I mean that really is insane and that's a real problem with kovat
*  They say that one of the major factors in kovat is obesity. It's a huge factor
*  Yeah, which is a man, you know in general or whatever. It's pretty I get a kick out of
*  How we're pretty soft, you know as Americans
*  I mean, especially if you third world countries and then you look at like people are happy
*  They don't have to go to work and I'm like, I know good God like a lot of people are actually making more money from unemployment
*  Yeah, then they would be if they went back to work
*  especially like waiters and stuff like that because you're dealing with a much smaller amount of people in the in the
*  in the restaurants and businesses because they're even in like
*  Texas even though the restaurants were open
*  I think I think they were at 75% capacity and then they just rolled it back to 50%
*  So if you're working as a waiter or waitress, you know, you're you're gonna make less money
*  So for some folks, it's actually better for them to say oh, I don't want to do it
*  I'm just keep collecting unemployment and you actually make more money that way
*  I've talked to a bunch of people that have said that they make more money off unemployment
*  Well, we we um, yeah Kofaru we just kept every we just kept paying everybody
*  You know, we we took a four months off. I guess just paid everyone we would ever
*  and we you know, I was looking at like how that worked and I was like good God once I started reading about the
*  Talking about the unemployment. I'm like Jesus. There's gonna be a lot of people that don't go back to work and it's a yeah, Colorado
*  But but it's it's sad man
*  It's really sad because there's a lot of people that are losing their businesses through no fault of their own
*  They didn't do anything wrong. They work hard. They're disciplined. They show up every day
*  They put together a business and now it's folding it's going under and it might be happening to the Comedy Store
*  I mean, they don't they don't know what they're gonna do and I heard the lab factor is about to go under as well
*  So the state of comedy in California is in a real bad real bad place right now real bad. Yeah, that sucks
*  Yeah
*  It it I don't want to dive into this too much, but I just it just it's it's fucked up
*  it seems way blown out of proportion and I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but
*  How many people do you know they're sick personally I know one guy who almost died
*  Yeah, and he's not a old guy his name is Michael. Yo, he's a comic and he there's a bunch of
*  Extinuiting circumstances and one of them being that he has vitamin D deficiency
*  Another one being that he flew to New York with very little sleep worn out did radio and promotion did TV shows
*  Then did two shows at a comedy club two shows the next night flew back home
*  Again, very little sleep got in his car with his family drove to Vegas to be with his wife's family
*  And then drove back home on the same day
*  So that's at least eight hours in the car just driving and then he had auditions the next two days and he just was wiped
*  Out it was burning the candle at both ends. Yeah, and he got real sick real. So yeah immune system was just crushed
*  Yeah, but that's you shouldn't do that all those things that's too much
*  You know, it's it's just poor planning and then you know on top of that
*  I think he was run down already like he might have had a little bit of a cold already
*  So it kicked in and it was bad
*  I mean he was hospitalized for over a week and his doctor actually told him
*  They were you know thinking about putting him on a ventilator and his doctor said if we put you on a ventilator
*  You'll probably die and it turns out his doctor was a wise man because
*  Somewhere around 80% of the people they put on ventilators in New York City died. Yeah, I heard that that's crazy
*  The doctor was saying that if you put the guy if you if you put him on a ventilator his body would stop working
*  It's like if if I give your body this machine that starts working for and your body stops working
*  There's no guarantee. It's gonna start working again. It's gonna breathe on its own again, right? Scary fucking shit, man
*  Yeah, but they you know, and but here's the big one man. They're the real big one that drives me crazy
*  Why are they not talking about how to take care of yourself?
*  Instead of all this fear of you got to wear a mask and you got a social distance and all that stuff's great
*  Yeah, you should do that. You should wear a mask
*  You should social distance, but you know, you should also do a drink a lot of water. You should also get sleep
*  You should also stop eating sugar. You should also take vitamins supplement your diet. Try to get some sunshine
*  You know do do all the things that you need to do for health get exercise
*  Increase your cardiovascular capacity. It's a giant factor and whether or not you you know, you recover from this disease or how quickly you recover
*  No
*  My buddy John called and he was like going on a tirade about exact same thing you're talking about he you know
*  He he's um, she might know me. He's a PRS. He's
*  shooter long-range shooter
*  He is a super fit guy lawn mowing, you know normal dude, right?
*  He owns a like a lawn mowing deal anyway
*  But he's one of the better shooters in the United States or fuck out of North America long-range rifle shooting. Yeah. Yeah
*  He's crazy. Good. I would not want him shooting at me at a thousand yards and he
*  You know his thing was is why the fuck aren't we giving people dieting advice? Why are we telling people rather than having all these?
*  Announcements it's like hey
*  We're losing so much money. Like let's start focusing people as dieticians
*  Let's let's get people on a health food kit
*  Let them like I mean how many people and you pick a hundred people 99 probably understand how to eat healthy, right?
*  Not not their fault, right? They just I didn't know how late on yeah. Yeah, I agree and I mean
*  You know on my end I'm super lucky we live at 10,000 feet, you know
*  Well, you I've had my wife dropped me off to bottom of the mountain
*  So I have to hike home to get dinner, right?
*  You want you want a way to get healthy fucking get to eat it
*  so she drops me off at the bottom of the mountain and I go to the top sheets she cooks all organic and
*  I talked to some of these people that have other issues and they're worried about Kovac and I'm like
*  You were about fucking Kovac, right? You've got a hundred other problems other than Kovac, right?
*  You're like diabetic and a bunch of other shit it's amazing not to get on a diet thing, but
*  America's pretty bad as far as that goes. We should put some money into that our health system is all about
*  Fixing you once you're broken. It's not about preventing you from being broken
*  Everything is about our health care system is all about care once you're injured or care once you're sick
*  It's very little is about preventative nutrition and making sure you take care of your body and education
*  I mean our governor all the all our mayors all these people are doing is just talking about wearing masks
*  Talking about staying home flattening the curve making sure they I mean all this shit. They're talking that no
*  Advice at all about taking care of yourself. No advice at all on meditation. No advice at all on
*  Eating healthy and exercise. Yeah, it's sad. I say that as I just jammed a giant wad of chewing so but how bad is that?
*  For you though. I mean if you I mean as far as like was it doing it
*  It gives you a little jolt right? Yeah. Well for for me obviously the worst thing obviously cancer, right?
*  I mean, that's obvious. That's bad. But other than that, I mean there's not how many people get cancer from that shit
*  Is it real common? Ah, man, I'd have to lift that up. I don't know. I um, what's that there neuro gum
*  This is you're gonna get much other kind of shit. I'm addicted to um, this is good stuff
*  It's nootropics in mint form. You've already got me addicted all that shit on on it
*  You know what the first time I took alpha brain now that we're just diving down all time
*  I had the most crazy ass dreams, which I knew that shit worked because I don't dream and
*  But either way, I mean as far as the Copenhagen, I'm just my buddy was addicted to cocaine in Copenhagen
*  He tried to quit both. He's still chewing Copenhagen. So give me an idea
*  It's not easy to quit but that Zen what we were talking about it. It is just nicotine in it
*  it's ZIN
*  ZYN and
*  This first time my life I think I'm gonna be able to quit
*  So I went from a can and a half a day to about a can every four days. There it is
*  Our ZIN nicotine pouch is safe recently a novel non tobacco nicotine products in has been developed
*  Is similar similar to snus? I never knew how to say that. Okay. Thank you
*  I think however contains no nitro samines. Is that the word nitro samines or
*  polysilic
*  Nucrocarbons which may be potentially may potentially be carcinogenic
*  The overall safety of ZIN is better than snus. However, it only has a little bit less nicotine than snus
*  Okay, what does that mean? I don't know. They just say don't read anything bad. You're gonna take away my birthday here
*  I so it's a pouch. So you have to pack a wad of mulch and stuff it into your face
*  Yeah, yeah a little more professional. It just gives you a jolt
*  I tell you what I put two of them in the first time and I got dizzy as shit
*  So, um, it's got some strong I mean because they said it's a hundred cigarettes and a can of chew
*  Equal of Copenhagen. Oh my god. Oh man and a hundred cigarettes were the nicotine
*  That's what they say. So how many cigarettes worth was that giant wad that you stuffed in your face? Yeah, I don't know
*  I'm gonna get I'm sure I'm gonna get some hate mail from this
*  I'm talking about being fat and unhealthy and I'm chewing Copenhagen, but I
*  What's a stimulant yeah, well the other thing the physical addiction that's the problem with Zen you don't spit right
*  You know get used to that. I mean
*  She's holding for a while. Well, I do taste good. Maybe that's why I got so dizzy
*  Um, I got like a citrus one or whatever, but I just it's the first time my life where I've been like, yeah, honey
*  I think I might be able to quit
*  One of the stunt guys used to work with on fear fact
*  He told me that he learned he used to swallow the spit
*  You know and he turned me learned how to do that on sets because you couldn't just carry a bottle around
*  You spit into it or spit into a cup. Yeah, so he just would swallow the juice and I thought it was so fucking disgusting
*  It is disgusting. Have it that's pretty bad. So but yeah, I don't know whatever we'll see
*  I guess in three months if I text you and be like, hey, I fuck I quit
*  Do you drink a lot of coffee too? No, I mean I drink a decent amount of coffee
*  I mean I'm like caffeine, you know, I get migraine so I'm 500 milligrams a day. I really much map it out
*  Yeah, so you take caffeine to avoid migraines? No, I just know that I
*  Because I get as I say that when I got on TRT I get a migraine once every three months
*  I was getting them once a week. So whatever TRT did which I have to thank you for that, right? That's
*  talk about that in a minute, but okay, I I
*  Learned really quick seeing neuropsychologists and brain doctors. They don't know fucking thing about the human brain
*  They're like here takes more pills. No, and so
*  Literally don't we're in real trouble. Well, they're giving me these band-aids and I'm like look
*  I don't want something that fixes after I got it
*  I don't want to fucking get them right like, you know
*  This thing could probably take what make my asshole turn around start talking back to me the fucking negatives to this pill
*  I'm taking for my my migraines are so bad. I mean you wasn't one of those pills
*  There's some pills you take once a week. I just take it when I get one
*  So I have ocular migraines like I couldn't I couldn't tell you two apart when I get them I get blurry vision
*  An hour before I get the migraine. So I take that pill as soon as I get blurry vision
*  Now my head itches and I'm all kinds of goofy. There's some kind of anti anxiety or depressing in that thing
*  There's a bunch of other shit. I don't know but I don't get a migraine but those pills cannot be good for you
*  I wanted to get to a point. Is it my diet? All right, is that what's give me the migraine? Is it caffeine?
*  You know cuz there was a time I didn't take any caffeine
*  so I map out everything and I kept a log of when I got migraines and so
*  Once I got that's why I know exactly what it feels like. I've never had a migraine. What does it feel like?
*  Jamie pounding a fucking nail through my eye socket. It's just so just intense pain. I got so bad
*  I had to get a spinal epidural for
*  because I was
*  Heating up blood because I was convulsing basically what I'm not the only one
*  Yeah, yeah
*  So when you get them
*  And they're not all that bad
*  But you get sick and you would vomit uncontrollably and then your esophagus would rub together or whatever and you bought vomit of blood
*  and so so you're
*  from
*  Explain where's the blood coming from? You said your esophagus is rubbing rubbing together heaving
*  No different when your kidneys rub together when you dehydrate you piss blood same principle except that you're that's what that is
*  Your kidneys are rubbing together. Is this all science? Yeah, I pee blood a few times on backpack hunts
*  You run out of water kidneys rub together and you'll be rubbed together. That's what's causing it. Yeah, I guess so that seems
*  Wrong. Well, I I'm not a doctor. I just play one on a podcast, but I've had doctors tell me that's why
*  Kidneys rub together. Well, um, so your esophagus is rubbing together from you heaving from the pain of the migraine from the yeah from the
*  Motherfucker so people listening to this
*  I'm sure you're gonna get all kinds of emails kiss when I started talking about a podcast
*  I started getting tons of people. This is what I took to get rid of them
*  This is you know, I mean literally hundreds of people that have suffered from migraines
*  And I've had a lot of concussions, you know shit so that I'm sure that's part of the problem
*  Well part of the problem is my blood pressure is extremely low
*  When did you get the concussions from the service or I had one bad one there?
*  I had two bad ones in football flipped a bike over got kicked in it kicked in the head once later on
*  It was pretty bad. It's in a car wreck and another one. So I've had nine
*  And did the migraines come after that? Yeah. Yeah
*  And actually I recently had you'll like it. I don't you man to listen to it. I had Steve Tetrell
*  He was a station with him in Korea. I got hit with an AT4 got fired off a rocket launcher
*  I was right behind it. That's how I get that big knot on my head up here
*  That was when they started that was bad and so whatever Michael you know who we were talking about before
*  He actually played football in high school and college and he had some real bad concussions
*  He gets migraines because of that as well. Yeah, I think there's probably a connection
*  Well, I would I would think that have to be but one thing I noticed is my whatever's gone on in my melon
*  My blood pressure is low and I got a bit of a temper problem
*  And so when I my anger spikes up my blood pressure rises I get a migraine the next day
*  That's the real connected, you know, like brain damage and temper is very connected
*  Well, I started working on meditation like I've really you know
*  I've really it's helped in my shooting because I can really focus out of you know
*  I can get I mean as weird as it sounds right become one with yourself right trying to so
*  Trying to keep my blood pressure low
*  Well, I think with the TRT my blood thickened up some from when
*  You know when I wasn't taking it my blood was super thin
*  Maybe that's it. I don't say thickened like
*  More red blood cells. Well when I say thickened this has no scientific nothing when they take my blood every three months
*  When they first took my blood it ran like water when they took it the next time they were like
*  Hey, your blood's thickened up whatever that is bread blood cell count. I don't know they were like your blood is thicker
*  It is not
*  It is not as thin or runny as it was before and I'm like, it's my blood pressure up there said well
*  It's normal now for everybody listening is welcome to another episode of two morons talking about medicine
*  As we're saying that I told the lady that I work with and she basically said the same thing
*  She's like well, we'll take credit for it
*  Although I don't know that has any scientific weight on the subject, but the moment I started taking to your house
*  Testosterone increases the chance of clot formation in two ways a common side effect of testosterone therapy is there we go with the words poly
*  Thymia which increases the body supply of hemoglobin and hemocrit
*  Hematocrit
*  Affecting the blood cells this can increase the blood pressure and thicken the blood slightly. There you go
*  See, I'm not full of shit everyone. I was 100% truthful
*  Science whether that has to do with it. That's just a redneck
*  We avoid saying I don't get migraines anymore and that could be why whatever the actual scientific reason is my blood is definitely
*  Thicker and my blood pressure is normal
*  one of the things that happens also that people that have had a bunch of head injuries is your
*  Endocrine system doesn't function properly new pituitary gland doesn't produce hormones correctly and it makes people depressed. Gotcha makes you
*  very lackadaisical
*  lethargic it's very difficult to get motivated for things and
*  They find that with football players particularly with soldiers a lot of soldiers
*  That are treated by my friend. Dr. Mark Gordon
*  He runs this traumatic brain Institute and the whole goal of this is
*  It was essentially to try initially to try to figure out why these soldiers and football players and martial artists and all these people were
*  Experiencing so much depression what was going on and it turned out that many your pituitary gland is really sensitive
*  Yeah, well an endocrine system just get really fucked up by even jet skiing
*  Well, luckily like what they would have on my blood test every three months, you know, I don't go to the doctor
*  I'm bad about that. And so that was like the first time I had a physical basically and so ever and a couple decades
*  Yeah, I don't I
*  Got pneumonia once and I went to the doctor for that
*  Almost died I was too stupid, you know that how a man's or a woman whatever how a certain individuals brain works
*  It's stupid looking back at it. I thought I had like allergies or something and I'm like, hey, let's go do cardio
*  Let me work this out of my system. I work my ass right into the hospital. I double on pneumonia and no wow
*  You have an idiot and I'm trying to push. Yeah. Oh, yeah, I pushed my way right in almost death
*  Like I got pneumonia when I was 19. It was rough
*  Well, I took me like six months to get back on track but the lady was super nice
*  I remember going in and she's like, hey, who's your doctor? I'm like, I don't I don't have a doctor and she's like
*  Well, you have Kaiser insurance. I'm like if I have a doctor I haven't seen him, you know
*  I'm like you tell me who my doctor is cuz I don't know, you know, and cuz they assign you a writer, you know one of those
*  Responsible people no
*  Negative, I'm horrible. Um
*  I'm like the worst adulterer known a man is bad
*  And so she they gave me the x-ray and they're like you have double lung pneumonia and I'm adulting is hard it is
*  You know people give me you know, you suck at anything. It's good a photography shooting. I'm like, yeah, I'm fucking horrible adulting
*  I didn't file my taxes for four years. I've got a lot of downfalls. Oh, it's all taken care of now
*  It's when I have people at work that come up with an issue and they're kind of embarrassed
*  I'm like, look, there's nothing you have fucked up that I haven't do not be embarrassed. I can help you
*  Because I focus on so many other things things like that just get pushed away
*  so you find that because of all the time you spend in the woods that it's kind of difficult to concentrate on all that silly shit because
*  It's when you're out in that primal environment, you know, like there's something about it that makes all that other stuff seem
*  Meaningless, you don't want to focus on it or and yeah, cuz we live in a society where it's important and I'm not good at it
*  It's horrible. I talk about all the time at work. I mean I hire people really smart around me
*  Because I'm just not you know, I we could be sitting there in a meeting
*  I shouldn't even say this out loud
*  Which is an extremely important meeting and I'm sitting here and thinking what my gear list is and how much my caloric intake will
*  Be on a five-day backpack hunt
*  Normal though you're spending 50% of your time literally sleeping under the stars. What's because we'll get done with a meeting
*  I'm like who took notes
*  because I but I I am now have gotten better at just telling people ahead of time like hey
*  You're gonna talk with me we're gonna do our initial bullshit session
*  You're not gonna want to deal with me after this cuz I'm gonna lay you down
*  I'm too busy
*  You're gonna deal with Frank or Dana or Anders or whoever that works for me
*  You're gonna deal with him
*  Don't expect me to come through cuz I'm my mind's on too much other stuff and I've had to get a lot better at that
*  Because I just don't function well on stuff like that
*  yeah, I think that the one of the reasons why the company's so good and you guys make such good backpacks is because
*  There's there's real like it's hard to
*  Put it down in the real world, you know, it's not like accounting or bookkeeping
*  And like where you know, oh we have to do the work here
*  But doing the work of actually sleeping under the stars actually camping actually hunting and hiking that's there's that's invaluable
*  There's been a few heated arguments over that where they've given me crap about paperwork and I'm like, oh
*  You know totally I get it
*  I'm gonna get better paperwork
*  But sure ass is coming with me on a 10-day backpack hunt and you're not fucking slacking and you're getting water and you're building fires
*  And you're spotting animals and when we get done with that if you're as good at that as I am
*  Then I'm gonna get better at paperwork
*  But until that fucking day right now what we're good at is making badass gear for the backcountry. That's why I hired you
*  Yeah, it's kind of work together, right?
*  Yeah, like you've got to be able to do that and they've got to be able to do the shit that you can't do
*  Yeah, and we're we have a tight-knit group now, which is great
*  like we have everybody knows their role and we're all supportive of each other and but there's times where I
*  Got to kind of stop and really take it like gut check where I'm like man
*  I have so solely focused my life on living and not dying like like hunting and staying alive to where
*  Thank God for my wife, right? I mean she's an angel because like she's we're getting ready by house, right? And so we
*  Should you miss this on this we go to get credit right credit like I'm good check my credit score
*  When would you say is the last time I had credit? I don't know. What was the last time you had credit?
*  What would you take a guess with normal human?
*  four years ago 20
*  So they're like well your debt-to-income ratio is great, which it's unheard of and I'm like, oh cool
*  They're like, you know any credit and I'm like a cell phone like no you don't have any credit
*  Because you don't have like a leased car or you haven't had a mortgage or any of those things
*  I've had fucking anything and so I was like, so let me get this right
*  I'm not gonna say how much I make but I do good
*  I'm like, so my wife makes essentially less has substantially more bills and her credit score
*  She gets approved for more than I do
*  They want to they want to show that you have a history of paying things back
*  Like I was told that early on like to get credit. You should actually get a loan
*  I was like, well, wouldn't it be better if I saved money? Well, no, it's actually better if you spend money and and pay the bills
*  Well, I can tell you I made an ass of myself at that loan office cuz I was like, are you fucking kidding me?
*  I'm like so I can go right now and buy a vehicle cash, but that's bad. And they're like, that's bad
*  My wife was laughing her ass off because she knew how I live like a caveman. I mean, I don't get bills
*  I I
*  Save and I buy like I bought a tundra. I paid cash for it. Isn't that be healthy?
*  I thought it seems like it's fiscally prudent. Well, you are wrong Joe
*  Cuz I was literally I was like so we had to go it's fun
*  So I go to believe it or not. I go to discount tire. I got approved for
*  $1,200 which is insane for what I make and I'm like, so this is I can get four tires
*  That's all I got and they're like, well, you don't have any you don't any credit
*  My credit score now is like a 710
*  So you have to just buy more shit with credit to get credit
*  Oh my wife went and got we got a B&H photo card
*  We got so we just got a bunch of cards that we could pay off
*  I maxed them all out so she can make payments. It is fucking weird. Isn't that we exist like that?
*  I mean, that's the only way people could buy houses really though
*  I mean how if you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you want to buy a six hundred thousand dollar house
*  That's not even possible. You'd have to by the time you're done saving you
*  Mean the house would be worth more than that
*  Anyway, well see my wife gets a kick out of it because she knows how I mean, you know
*  I'm she's super close to me. And so she knows how my brain functions and I'm like
*  Why don't people just work harder and put you know, go do some side jobs just figure shit out
*  Well, she's like, yeah, no people don't do that. Honey. You're weird. They put it on credit and I'm like, well
*  I'll go put somebody shower door and I'll figure it out
*  Well living your life that way for 20 years is not good
*  Well, a lot of people are finding that out because of this
*  Pandemic that living like that with credit and and you know having high bills and paying those bills off
*  That's what a lot of companies did because they thought it was the right way to do it
*  Yeah
*  and those companies are fucked right now because they've had no income coming in at all for three or four months and it's gonna implode my
*  Buddy Andrew Schultz said it best. He said this pandemic has exposed
*  Weaknesses both in people's health and in businesses financial health. It's exposed the flaws
*  Yeah in the way they operate no
*  I it was an eye-opener for me and I and this isn't like something to be proud of that
*  I haven't been good at adulting for 20 years, but I just I
*  Literally was like off. I want to set up binoculars
*  I'll save up by binoculars how many people contacted you to talk to you about hunting though
*  once shit started getting weird an awkward level and not just hunting sustainment cuz yeah, can I
*  Try to name drop a bark low. Yeah, John John bark low works with Sitka gear and he and I are
*  If he wasn't my brother you would have never known same mentality same thought process same ideas on gear and he's love that guy
*  He's great. He we just did a podcast. He's like, are you sure this isn't gonna piss anybody off?
*  I'm like fuck it. They need to hear it, right?
*  And so what were you pissing people off with?
*  The reality of how life works living in the woods and the people that fake it basically, you know
*  How many people you know stay out there three days and all of a sudden they're experts, right?
*  Yeah, the reality a lot of photos. Yeah. Yeah the reality of living being able to survive and be happy
*  And then what you read and everything else basically just you know talking about that. So
*  with the
*  Okay, so everybody grabbed toilet paper, right in third world countries. You wipe your ass with your hand
*  You don't worry about toilet paper. So toilet paper is gone. Wet wipes are gone
*  Go to the grocery store. Everything that lasts forever is still there like you get pasta
*  Top ramen simple stuff. It's all on the shelves, but all these things that Americans have to have
*  I'm not saying I want to wipe my ass with my hand by any means but you don't need toilet paper to survive
*  Right. You need clean water, right? You need food
*  You body will last quite some time three or four weeks without food with water
*  It's a couple days and so I'm looking at all these things leaving and I have all my I'm not like a prepper by any means
*  But we've got crap the house and I was you know, so that this came story time for my wife where I'm explaining to her
*  What would happen if everything kind of shit hits the fan and what's gonna happen and Americans are so weird with the way that
*  We think and so I had tons of people from what kind of gun what kind of survival stuff fire starter
*  What kind of stove so, you know, I saw butane stoves a canister stove. That's the end thing
*  Everybody uses those but a multi-fuel stove when the world comes when the world ends the zombies are coming a
*  Multi-fuel stove burns kerosene diesel gas white gas burns everything. No one uses those anymore. They're a little bit heavier
*  But things like that that multi-fuel stove everyone should have one of those because you can no matter where you go
*  You're gonna have some type of fuel to burn in that thing
*  So we talked a lot about that on the podcast that was a lot of the questions I got was, you know, sustainment
*  So, I mean it's a weird world we live in but I live I definitely live probably in a weirder one in some way
*  Yeah
*  I mean everybody wanted to know how to get a gun
*  Everybody wanted to know how hard is it to go hunting for the first time?
*  Those are the questions that I got a lot
*  Like how do you get a gun was a big one and there was lines outside the LA gun stores
*  It was really crazy to see well, my wife was worried about I'm like, honey. Don't worry
*  I'm gonna take theirs like don't worry. They don't know how to use it. We're good
*  If somebody comes trying to get your stuff
*  Oh, well in my with a local game warden, he was we text back and forth
*  He was like dude, you would not believe how many people are like, I'm just gonna go wait it out
*  Drove their asses into the mountains and set up some Walmart tent and then a snowstorm hit like this isn't a story this that he's
*  Like dude, we're pulling people out like crazy. They were doing this in March. Yeah
*  Yeah, so he was laughing he's like dude
*  You would not believe the amount of people that were like I'm gonna go wait this thing out in the woods and it's like
*  You're camping beside the road. You're not really waiting anything out
*  So people don't even understand once you just one night by yourself out there and you would have a totally different
*  Understanding of like what what it actually means to exist in the wilderness without assistance and it's very scary where we're so
*  Accustomed to life with assistance whether it's buildings or electricity or air conditioning and
*  Frigidration and all the different things that we use
*  Supermarkets, we're good. We're so so doughy. Oh, yeah. Well so soft Windsor. What's the longest you've gone without talking to somebody?
*  Not very long
*  Jamie maybe a day
*  So you look at like alone and I explained into my wife. I'm like
*  The gear they have is enough like they have enough to survive
*  I was like what kills people is they are alone. They don't have that many people to talk to right?
*  They don't the fear think about how many people are afraid of the dark growing and then what to you know
*  What to do if something happens? There's all that unknown and
*  That to me like we go out for fun for 14 days backpack in with what's on our back for 14 days
*  And we're choosing to do that and what about solo? What's your longest solo trip 14 14 solo?
*  Boy you better not have any fucking skeletons in your closet. Mmm. Ah, man. I talked about this a long time
*  You want to talk about everything you fucked up in life by about day seven? You're like, I'm a piece of shit
*  I should have done more for my kid
*  Why didn't I because you have seven days to think about everything you've done wrong and and that's one thing that people
*  Really need to understand is getting right with which I've tried to work on a ton
*  It's just getting right with everything in life that you know up until that point like any wrongdoings
*  You've made any anything any skeletons just trying to clean them up
*  Well, if you stay busy in life, you can avoid all your mistakes you stay busy
*  You don't think about your mistakes, but when you're alone and you have downtime, that's when they creep into your mind
*  Well and in sleep deprivation. Mm-hmm water deprivation food deprivation all of that along with you know being alone
*  Starts to take a toll on the human mind and it's it's funny you see same with alone with same backpack hunt
*  You know, I get thousands of emails
*  You know what? I'm going to my first backpack hunt going in for 14 days. I'm like, yeah
*  14 days, but that's your plan, right?
*  You're gonna go in about three Colorado loves you
*  You're gonna donate 500 bucks to an oak tag and you're gonna get in there and you're gonna pitch out
*  You're gonna head back out about three days. We're gonna take your money and not give it back. Is that the average?
*  Yeah, yeah three four. So a lot of guys think they're gonna be able to do it and what what gets them you think?
*  What's the what's the first thing that gets them other than mentally weak, right? That's it. That's the what gets that's the big one
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, I mean
*  You know not to bring up cam again, but he blew that up like it was fun
*  Right. He's even a reason I have to say like you like he's not a gear geek
*  Right cameras just harder than woodpecker lips, right? He's not a gear when I see he's not a gear geek
*  He's so fucking tough. Like I talked about this seminar the other day. I used him as an example
*  He pushed this Gore-tex Bivvy, which is the worst thing in the world is sleeping, but he's so tough
*  He didn't give a shit. Well, all these people are sleeping in go. It's a Gore-tex coffin, right?
*  You don't get you can hardly punch your clown in that fucking thing
*  Let alone have fun in it. And so when weather comes in you're in this Gore-tex coffin, you can't do anything your gear
*  So Gore-tex Bivvy is just like basically like a sleeping bag that's made out of
*  Waterproof material and you just sleep in it and it probably has no breathability or very little very little
*  I mean it has some but you get condensation in your foot box
*  And then if you use down your foot box is wet once it downs wet, it's flat. It's no good
*  It's a contractor's bag pretty much. Yeah, and I mean they make some that are decent
*  But you know, I would laugh so hard when cam was coming up and people are reading all this stuff and I'm like
*  Yeah, you're not fucking cam right? Like, you know, you can do you can think you want to be and you
*  When you go when you hike in usually, you know if you're you're coming from back east, right you
*  Forums and on Facebook whatever all the shit you different get and you're packing way too much shit, right like
*  Gear list wise I can go over in a minute
*  But you're packing probably 30 pounds of shit you don't need and so then you're smoked
*  Going in and you've watched way too much pre most videos and you think the elk are just coming screaming in on it
*  and that fucking doesn't happen and you don't see them and then the oh
*  Like my knees hurt right or oh, I gotta get back to my business all the excuses come up
*  You know and you can come up with some shit, right? I've heard some amazing excuses for coming out
*  Throughout these are just not tough enough and I'm not saying that like, you know
*  Me or cam or Frank or whoever's tougher
*  But the reality is if you were mentally tough and you really wanted it you would stay as long as and a lot of that
*  Mental toughness comes with the experience too
*  I'd imagine and it also comes with the experience of forcing your body to do tough things
*  You know
*  One of the things that cam talks about is that he really got into endurance racing to improve his hunting
*  When he first told me that I thought that was the dumbest thing I'd ever heard
*  I was like, I don't even get it like you're running to improve your hunt up
*  But then once you do it for a while you go, oh
*  Okay, I get it. First of all, I had no idea you get that tired hunting just hiking just walking around the woods is fucking
*  Exhausting and then when you add a pack, especially if you're living off your back like you do
*  You know just way I do it where if I'm staying in a lodge or you know, I've got a tent somewhere
*  Just carrying your stuff that you're hunting with is exhausting, but it's also something about
*  continually and regularly pushing your body and your brain way past the point where you want to quit and
*  Doing it so that you're comfortable with being uncomfortable and most people in everyday life are not comfortable with being uncomfortable
*  They never really get to that place. Yeah, if you become friends with pain, you'll never be alone
*  And that's what I look at it like yeah, and I'm not trying to blow it out of proportion because it is fun
*  if that's what you're into but
*  Reality, you're looking at two to seven to eight miles in
*  It in Colorado you're at ten to twelve thousand feet when I think about
*  Preparing for those things besides the shit the cam does I think about that fucking machine that you showed me
*  That's an inclined treadmill that has barbells on the side that you lift up
*  Yeah, so you're carrying this thing where you're going up a treadmill former carry
*  What is that thing the hit mill X pull that shit up? So?
*  Yeah, we have a we have the name for that which we can cuss on here, so it's called the cocksucker
*  Because it I put 45s on either side the problem with that name is some people like sucking cock and everybody likes getting their cocks
*  Nobody likes getting on that goddamn thing
*  When we first got it, so how I got them
*  Which actually this leads into that thing?
*  So this thing you're doing a farmers carry uphill on a treadmill and folks when I tell you just looking at this thing hurts
*  My feelings so how I got that
*  The guy I have to get one of those the the guy that's which I guess like whatever we can talk about this the guy
*  It's actually purchasing Kofaru with me
*  I would took him on a goat hunt the day before we went on the goat hunt. He had that downstairs and I'm like
*  Dude that is like perfect and he was like man get on it. So I got on it with no weight
*  He had 45s on either side. I'm like this is made for backpack hunting, right? Yeah
*  I would imagine that's probably other than actually hiking yourself. That's probably one of the best ways you could ever get in shape for that
*  Well, you think about it you look at like his little video there
*  So what I do is I have a 45 to 60 pound pack and I have two 45 pound dumbbells
*  And then I'll do five minute intervals with just a pack and then I'll grab the dumbbells and I'll do five
*  Two minutes of shrugs or just holding the weight up with the 45s
*  then I go and I put it down to like basically a half mile an hour and I do a truck pull and
*  I put my hands and you're basically just driving forward with your body not parallel to the ground
*  But just like if you're pulling a truck with a harness
*  Mm-hmm
*  And I do that and then I do those three exercises and interviews for 30 minutes and I'm pretty fucked up by the time
*  I could that looks like pull that picture up again the video of that shit
*  That looks like one of the hardest things you could do in terms of like something you could do in a gym if you're
*  Carrying that weight like in the farmers carrier and you're going uphill on a self. It's a self-propelled treadmill, too, right?
*  Yeah, I have one of those outside one of those air runners. Yep with I fucking love it
*  Well, you can't break it is what's nice, right? Right the self-propelled. So it's just so hard to work on
*  Yeah, but that thing's amazing. And does it vary the pitch? Can you raise it and lower it?
*  You can't vary the pitch you can just vary the resistance
*  So I hit the brake when I'm doing a truck pull I dropped the brake on it
*  and so you literally vary the resistance of the
*  Treadmill itself. Yeah, there's a brake
*  Yeah, it's on the left side. Oh my god. That sounds amazing. Well, what it
*  One thing about stabilizer muscles though. I would think that they don't necessarily get the same work
*  What if you did it with what do you remember those shoes that they got sued for?
*  Kim Kardashian was promoting them. They're like real fat smushy shoes
*  Yeah, like and so they made you kind of stabilized while you're walking. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I would think that those actually would be good
*  To wear on something like that because it would be you know what a sand dune stepper is. Yeah, they suck
*  Yeah, they'd go to in a good way. Yeah, I got one out here. Yeah, they'll burn out though. Yeah
*  They work different parts of your leg. Yeah, right. You try stabilizing, right?
*  Yeah, and I would imagine like having a sand dune stepper type shoe on while you are
*  Going on that thing would be the ultimate
*  Well, you're right and people do not think about that and that's one thing that guys that just run on on
*  pavement flat ground
*  Your when you say a stabilizer muscle, whatever you want to call it the left and right part of your shins
*  The first time you take a guy out that hasn't hiked side hills like 35 degree slopes with 45 pound pack
*  Their legs are their calves are smoked in the left and right side of their shin bone is just toasted because they're not working those and that
*  Lateral stability people understand that's why I'm not a runner
*  So I don't like running but I train with a pack on and I hike everywhere. And so we
*  Do a lot of side hills just to get those muscles ready for that because it's a different world and it'll it'll KO you
*  I mean you'll be down for a couple days because they're so sore and stiff if you never used them and that treadmill does not
*  Help with that. But when I said like that the sand stepper sucks, it's a good suck because it's a way indoors you can yeah
*  Yeah
*  One of the ways I try to explain people stable our stabilizer muscles is upside down kettlebell press. I was like take a kettlebell
*  They can press fairly easily like a 35 pound kettlebell
*  But most guys can press that overhead now take it and flip it upside down so that the handle is on the bottom and the kettlebell
*  Is above so you got to balance that sucker out and as you're lifting it, it's way more difficult to do and
*  That's that's using your stabilizer muscles. Yep. Another thing is those bamboo bars. Have you ever used one of those? Yeah
*  Yeah, we put all those in well some of that shit I copied from you
*  For my for my home gym, that's another one those you don't realize how much those kick the shit out
*  You tell you get them. Yeah, pretty amazing
*  It looks so easy
*  But when you put when you got a bamboo bar and I do it I hang kettlebells with rubber bands
*  So I have like heavy resistance bands that are hanging the kettlebell so it's all bouncy
*  Yeah, and so as you're lifting that fucker
*  But that you know really stabilizes everything keeps everything tight
*  It's funny how much you can torture yourself with very torture yourself with very little I am I got that big rope
*  And I just my forearms I got issue. Well, I talked to you about a tendonitis or whatever
*  So me doing the rope workout, it's just I wasn't doing it was hurting my forearms. And so I turned that into a rope drag. I
*  Hooked one of my belts from kefaro and hooked a harness to it
*  And I pulled it did that thing in half and wrapped it with gorilla tape and I dragged that up and down my driveway
*  Me that's horrible. Why it's bad
*  But I say bad when you've kind of committed your life to backpack hunting
*  There's only so many ways that you can get ready, you know, you just got to beat the shit out of yourself
*  I get ready to get ready. So like people like I'm crazy. We live at 10,000 feet
*  My wife's dropped me off the highway and then she goes home and cooks she goes with me a lot too
*  But how far is the walk?
*  Anywhere from five to two to five miles depending on where she drops me off and it's
*  Getting a couple thousand feet. It's a climb. It sucks
*  But
*  The best way if you're not feeling like working out is have your wife leave you in the middle of nowhere
*  Because you're fucking getting home right here
*  Necessity. Yeah necessity. And so when people don't I try to put myself in a position to where I
*  Have to do something if that makes sense because there's days you just don't feel like doing shit
*  I mean, right so right I just make my wife drop me off and I'll tell her, you know
*  I yeah, I would say earn my day like I got to earn my day, you know
*  I keep tracking my steps on my watch and so she'll drive my ass to the bottom of that fucker 50 pounds and she'll
*  Laugh leaving I always tell people one of the best ways to make sure you do something is have a list
*  Just have a list of what you got to do today. Just make sure you're doing it. Just write it down
*  It seems so crazy
*  But if you don't have a list if you don't have it written down what you absolutely have to do, man
*  You're gonna slack off
*  You're gonna find reasons why you should do less or especially if you do like what I do is when I lift I train
*  Myself for the most part, you know, sometimes I work with trainers
*  I work with a kickboxing trainer now, but most of my weightlifting sessions I do by myself
*  So I have to I have right out what I need to do. Yeah, and if I don't do that
*  I mean then I feel like a pussy. Yeah, but if I if I have it written down like today
*  You're running two miles in the hills. Yeah today you're doing this today. You're doing that if I don't do that
*  It's it's you're not gonna get it done if you could just give yourself a
*  manageable goal to start with
*  It's real simple make sure like for every day this week you're gonna do 40 push-ups you're gonna do 50 sit-ups
*  You're gonna just give yourself some kind of manageable goal get a chin-up bar do, you know 20 chin-ups every day
*  Just do that just you that's a manageable thing like you can do that in
*  30 minutes you could have all that done and you're good. But if you force yourself to do that every day
*  Man, you're gonna feel real results real results. Like at the end of the week, you're gonna go fuck
*  I did it and then ramp it up some more ramp it up some more but it's all about writing it down
*  Yeah, I got a whiteboard and yeah
*  in fact
*  I wrote something on the whiteboard once and a bunch of people I think you and Jaco did a podcast because
*  The one day I just wrote on there just do something
*  Yeah, and I think you guys must have done a podcast and talked about that because I you know people I
*  Mean, I know it's not everybody has a free schedule. But even when I work construction
*  You can make time most people can make time now. I don't sleep that much
*  Which isn't a good thing, but how many hours you get a night? I recently got up to six, which is pretty good for me
*  I was at four for a long time. Damn. Yeah, but if you heard my day, right?
*  I was it because you want to sleep for I mean were you getting up early or is it just you have insomnia?
*  I have insomnia. I just don't sleep. I sleep I go to sleep
*  Well, I just don't sleep for that long
*  I know it's when you wake up is you waking up with something bothering you in your head or you just fuck I'm awake
*  I'm just like fuck I'm awake and I got a lot to do and so but it's gotten better to where
*  I've been tracking it on the watch. I
*  Think you got a g-shock there. It's what I used to wear
*  This is one of those ones tracks my steps and calories and everything. So I said a Garmin. Yeah, it's a fuck
*  Phoenix six solar I think um that work on solar power. It helps it. Yeah helps battery life
*  So I I did not like the original because they died pretty quickly, you know
*  Batteries this one lasts almost like three four weeks really so and the way that I navigate often UTM grade coordinate
*  I don't need to leave it on very long. So it works. I can use it for a long time
*  So that work with navigation how long will it last man?
*  I if you left it on I would think man three or four days, maybe
*  So in that three or four days, it's supplementing with solar. Is that what it is? Yeah. Yeah
*  So that's fucking amazing so the way that I you know navigate which actually going back to the board
*  I can't agree with you more like I just write shit down and it may be
*  Three sets of 50 crunches three sets of 50 push-ups. Just you do it
*  Yeah
*  And then check them off the list right and so in those are the days when I stay I don't want to do anything
*  Those are the days on my ass is getting dropped off the bottom of the hill because you fucking have to do something
*  You're gonna get home
*  But with the way that I navigate
*  And I get people
*  Crap about this all the time right you got a watch in a Garmin in reach in a GPS
*  You got all kinds of shit to navigate. You don't know how to fucking use it
*  That's like a big pet peeve of mine
*  You got all this technology put you hit the easy button on everything. You never learned how to use it. And so
*  I'm like a real stickler on land nav like learning how to navigate to a certain degree and not just using a GPS
*  And so what I do is I have a using eight or ten digit
*  UTM grid coordinate and I and a map and so does that mean so the way the world was
*  Mapped basically and I'll try to explain as easy as I can from from top to bottom
*  There's lines drawn around it spaced and then there's horizontal lines drawn around it
*  And each one of those is a square and as you break that down in squares you end up with a thousand meter grid square
*  This is like a very plain Jane way to explain it inside of that grid square when I turn this on
*  It tells me
*  Inside of that grid square how far I am from left to right and how far I am from bottom to top
*  So easting and northing and so inside that thousand meter grid square my pinpoint location is a
*  Ten digit grid coordinate within three meters of my location
*  So anyway, once it gives me that I can plot out and up to where I am inside that grid square on my map
*  And gives me my exact location
*  What it means if I'm all fucked up and I have no idea where I'm on I just turn on my watch and it tells
*  Me and then I plot it out on my map and then if I'm lost
*  Okay, so it plot it shows you on your watch and then you just look down at the map to save power and but
*  you actually know how to use a compass and
*  navigate and
*  Actually use a map. Yeah, exactly. So that's a on a skill. You'll have all these different grid squares
*  Okay, and so this is wrong for people just listening. He's drawn stuff right now on paper
*  So if this it's a thousand meters over and a thousand meters up thousand meter box
*  Okay, so if I take a line and I'm 700 meters easting or to the right
*  So I go over 700 meters and then I'm 300 meters up. I go up 300 meters where those
*  Intersect so then you know where you are where I'm at. And so what people don't understand like if you talk about
*  Intersection and resection if you're lost so
*  Let's say Jamie ever been in the woods very much. So you're out and you don't know where you're at
*  But you know two known points
*  So meaning you can see a mountain over here and here and you know what those are and you have a map
*  From where you're at you can shoot an azimuth to the top of this mountain. What's an azimuth?
*  you take your compass and it's the
*  basically out of 360 degrees, mm-hmm, it's the the azimuth or the the
*  Direction of that mountain from where you're at
*  So you you take that
*  And then you do a back azimuth and you draw a line from the top of that back the top of that mountain backwards
*  So if it's over 180 you subtract if it's under 180 you add so you let you look at it
*  So that's northeast and so then you look behind yourself. No, and you go that southwest. No, no
*  So if I'm if I'm lost, but I don't I don't know where I'm in
*  Okay, I know this mountain and I know this one and I shoot this, you know
*  Azimuth with my compass and I know so right now
*  This is 90 degrees. So that's about 45 degrees
*  So that is under 180 so I add to it and so
*  180 plus 45 is what 225?
*  So now I go to on my map the top of this mountain and I do an azimuth and that azimuth is going to be
*  225
*  Fritz was in the top mountain is going to cross my exact location
*  And you writing this stuff on the map or you're just looking at it
*  Yeah, all right on a map and I go to this mountain
*  I do the exact same thing and where those two lines crisp my cross is my exact location when you draw on your map
*  Do you use a marker to use a highlighter? How do you do it?
*  I have an erasable pen with me just like it's just a little like a sharpie erasable pen and I have a protractor anyway
*  Just because this kid this is a course that takes weeks to actually
*  Learn how to do it this from the military these skills
*  I learned this originally when I was on that trocruz team and then it was I learned more and more and more when I was
*  In the military I went to some land nav schools and what they do is they drop you off and they give you
*  You give they give you two ten digit or eight digit grids ones where you're at and ones where you're going and then you have
*  to plot from
*  I'm gonna lose you here in a minute. You're like this is boring as fuck as it is
*  But you're gonna have to you have to convert it from
*  basically
*  There's different North's from where you're at. There's a grid North a magnetic North
*  Before we get really fucking boring here
*  Once you learn how to do that you're never lost you can train associate you can with a you know with and so I'm a real
*  Stickler on using all of those things so I've taught my wife how to do it. It's not that difficult
*  You know once you get going as far as so this is something you learn when you were really young when you were cutting trees
*  They have 14
*  Learned it then and then you learned more have you been formally trained in this stuff or well in the military
*  I was formally trained in and I would went to a class, but I was so young
*  I can barely remember when I was working for the Forest Service
*  and then now I teach courses for this because
*  the
*  The ability to get where you're going
*  It's kind of lost now because you just turn on a GPS or you use base map or on X or whatever right?
*  But the reality is is navigating if you're in a hurry so if you and I
*  You know we're in the woods, and we needed to get to a basin before dark
*  You're gonna have handrails and catching features
*  You know you know if you can look at that map and see it in a three-dimensional way
*  And I can grab my compass and say hey if we head northeast
*  You know the whole way half-ass we're gonna hit this creek and that creeks gonna intersect with a trail
*  I don't have to use my compass anymore really I'm gonna shoot an assmith, and I'm gonna look at the farthest point
*  I can see to where we need to go that I'm gonna be able to see the whole way and that compass is gonna
*  Go in my pocket. We're gonna haul ass
*  Eventually we're gonna hit a creek
*  Somewhere, but generally where that creeks at let's say a trail crosses it. There's a handrail and a catching feature there anyway
*  This is boring shit, but it's not get there quick
*  But what's interesting is like?
*  Very few people know how to do this
*  And this is a critical skill if you do get lost and a lot of fucking people get lost in the woods
*  One of the things that you were talking about your podcast once that I never really took any consideration
*  Was the fact that a lot of binocular holders harnesses have magnets on them yep a lot of people love those like I've got one
*  Of those one of those marsupials gear. It's nice. Yeah, but those can fuck with your compass
*  Yeah, you got it. You definitely have to hold it out
*  He was giving me shit cuz we partnered up with them because he said my sales went down from you dickhead
*  And I was like dude. It's just it's got to be said right. I mean yeah, it's got to be said otherwise people gonna die
*  Well, it's funny because I even have I have a compass in my compass with me all the time really yeah
*  Fucking weird I know um I when I had a g-shock I had a compass beside the watch on the watch
*  I'm beside it a little soon to um
*  The thing is is like when I'm in when I was hunting out in Texas
*  I don't know where the fuck I'm at right you know it's Texas right and we're on these huge north, Texas
*  So it's like big plateaus and that did you see that Palo Duro Canyon where we were at it's like the Grand Canyon
*  It's fucking crazy, so you know where we are you know these guys have lived their entire lives, and they're like
*  Oh, it's Northeast to where you're at I guarantee they know where nor need they've formed at their whole lives where I'm like fuck
*  The fucking sun's not up the clouds are out which way is Northeast well
*  Oh, there's Northeast so I just have always kicked you know carrying you know always have a compass with me, but
*  Being lost when you're young and almost dying
*  That'll help you probably want to learn too because we when I was super young
*  Doring cotton and shit and snowing and rain and Oregon and you got lost oh fuck yeah, I almost died twice
*  I got stuck out overnight
*  Eleven the first time Jesus Christ you were by yourself well now
*  Let's I don't want to make this sound way worse than it was I was a dipshit and I was with my dad
*  He's probably drinking with his buddies, and I went after a deer and got all fucked up and couldn't find my way back whoa
*  When you were 11?
*  Yeah, which God I can't even I have a 12 year old daughter. I can't imagine
*  Oh, man
*  My poor mom right dealing with the shit
*  She had to deal with with me because I I was backpacking when I was super young right like backpacking all over the place and
*  I've always liked to do it so you can imagine you're you know nowadays like if my daughter
*  15 said hey, I'm gonna go on a four-day backpacking trip into the wilderness at what well fuck me can I go great?
*  Where with my mom had to deal with a lot of that as a kid I was always super adventurous
*  I just think that that feeling of not knowing if you're gonna survive and then surviving I
*  Don't want my kids to have that but goddamn. That's invaluable
*  When you we talk about it all the time that's one of the reasons I have so much respect for a guy like Frank or or
*  Jake
*  They have no fear of anything when you get to the point where there's no mountain truly no mountain too high no valley to whatever
*  Fuck is that saying is?
*  There's nothing that stops you you will get out and most people lack that meaning if you've backpacked in whatever six miles and
*  As long as you can get the animal out especially mule deer you can pack it out
*  And you see a mule deer two and a half three mile more miles in
*  And you have no you're like oh, yes, like going to 7-eleven. We're going right
*  There's not and this is normal for any backpack come right say can would say the same thing. There's nothing we can't get to there's nothing
*  We worry about we have enough gear. It's a cool feeling. You know I mean I don't think about it anymore
*  But it's definitely helped put some animals on the ground
*  It's also there's a mindset that the hardcore backpack hunter has that
*  You they look forward to those challenges and overcoming those challenges, and then when those things happen
*  It's something that you have prepared for so it's it's actually like almost like a positive experience
*  Yeah, and then you get out and you tell people how far in with you nine nine miles wow
*  Pack it on one trip. Oh, it was a big fucker. We had to take it twice and
*  I mean, I know a lot of guys have ruined their body doing that too though. I know quite a few guys that have
*  sustained injuries with a heavy pack I
*  have like crazy stories when
*  one of our buddies it was he and I and he killed an elk and we were seven and a half miles in and
*  Anyway, you got on the ground. Thanks. Well
*  He's younger guy, and I anyway we split it in half and
*  It was downhill the whole way and I know I can pack you for infinite amount of time downhill
*  So I'm like fuck it. It's downhill. I didn't want to come back
*  So we're having our little hobnob meeting that next morning. We're getting ready to go out and that night
*  I ate everything I possibly could like drink water all night, and I picked up the pack and I like
*  I think we can make it fuck it if we can't we'll just leave some of it on the trail come back up
*  So we got 178 pounds legit. We weighed it in the truck. Oh my god. He had a hundred eighty four
*  Oh my god, so on the way down
*  These aren't bullshit. No, this fucking probably took ten years off my life
*  so we go on the way down and I took his bow and he took my walking sticks and were bushwhacking for the first two to
*  The trail and Frank and I went and reenacted this cuz I'm like dude
*  I gotta go see how bad this was cuz I was in fucking spirit world like half the time to use bad and so
*  Frank and I we did it and we marked it out and it was it was actually plus or minus right in that seven mile range
*  So we get to the trail. I'm like look dude. I'm not leaving you behind
*  But I'm fucking leaving you behind. I can't go this slow. I'm like I'll get to the truck
*  I'll turn around come back and grab you cuz I was fucking hurt and bad and um
*  Mmm. I called my buddy
*  You probably seen him on there. He's actually I can't say his name. He's a SF dude. I call him
*  I'm like dude. I I could need I need a pickup. I need you to come help us out and he's hardcore motherfucker
*  He's like, yeah, I'll be up. Let me talk to my wife
*  So I passed him on the way out on the trail and I've got I thought like a half mile to go
*  Cuz I could hear the highway and he's like dude. You got like a mile and a half. I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?
*  He's like, can you make it? I'm like, oh, I'm fucking making it like it's mind games now
*  Like I'm not letting this beat me and I'm like, but you gotta go ahead and get my buddy
*  He's fucked up. So I get to the trailhead I get the pack off
*  I'm laying in my underwear under the truck and if I had an IV I would have gave myself when there's hikers
*  It was awkward right there's hikers, but I was like fuck it. I'm done
*  So I'm just trying to get under the truck was in the shade and the wind was blowing
*  So I'm laying there literally just sprawled out four points to compass trying to cool off because I was worried about getting heat stroke
*  I get hydrated and thank God, you know, my buddy went and helped my other buddy
*  Anyway, he gets back and he's like dude. He was fucked up and I'm like how bad he was like when I got there
*  I keep my my buddy did not know he had help coming
*  So he's on his hands and knees on the wrong side of the trail
*  Looking for water and the creeks on the other side of the trail and you can hear it
*  So this is how and again, I'm gonna try to blow this out of proportion. It just happens, right?
*  you start talking about cognitive skills dehydration everything so
*  My buddy's like hey, dude, what's four plus four like he's checking him. He's a med he's a 18 delt. He's a medic and
*  He was fucked up. He hadn't eaten anything
*  He hadn't drinking water his brain wasn't working right
*  And so that's just one example of how fucked up you can get from you know
*  You got to be careful like you can do damage to how long did that hike out take?
*  Did about a mile an hour coming out Wow, so seven ish about yeah, I was bad
*  Fuck but I'd give you night, you know, that's so long
*  When I was with pinch he's the sniper guy he shot his goat at he was one of those dudes
*  He wanted to shoot it at 40 and in with a bow or a thousand and out with a gun
*  I can't remember the exact yardage, but it was over a thousand yards. So he shoots this thing across this glacier
*  It took us six hours to go 11 or 1400 yards straight line distance to a point where I'm like
*  We're gonna fucking die getting down to this thing. Like at one point time I slid down
*  I'm like, of course, I'm a dick my knees slam into my face and I'm like, we're all good
*  Come on down. I don't be the only one in pain, right? Here comes everybody else sliding down and pinch
*  It's like we're gonna get out of this. I'm like, well, we don't have a fucking choice now. We slid down it
*  We got to get back up, right?
*  And so we didn't get back till two o'clock in the morning and we were still four miles then so when people
*  You know like the idea of backpacking hunting. That's what they're liking is the idea of it
*  Cuz yeah glamorize the shit out of it
*  Again painful. He's not normal human. You can't go by his standards know his ideas
*  They say that sheep hunting is the hardest they say that like
*  like Alaska
*  Sheep hunting in terms of like just the difficulty of the terrain and the the dangers of it
*  Yeah
*  Somewhat. Yeah, I would say the one I've only been on a couple sheep hunts in Alaska, right?
*  Most of mine have been in lower 48 or the NWT
*  Northwest territories the thing with Alaska that's easy is you're not gaining that much altitude
*  Distance is far you're not but the weather is bad
*  Like generally the weather is pretty bad and then that the amount of pressure now and again
*  I'm not an expert on Alaska
*  The pressure is much worse than it's ever been in Alaska in terms of the amount of hunters hunters
*  Yeah, a lot of hunters out there and then animals
*  Grizzlies and shit. Yeah, which is a fucking real. You've seen us get charged on video. Yes
*  When you were with the gritty Bowman that was terrifying
*  Yeah, it's crazy. I yeah tell that I'm an adrenaline junkie. I'll tell a true story
*  Okay, because it's not I thought I we're calling it moose and I'm like looking and I'm like
*  I think there's a moose coming and a grizzly pops out
*  I'm like, hey get your camera. Let's call this thing in it
*  This is a true story because we made it sound like it was oh, yeah
*  Oh, here comes a grizzly
*  So I thought it was gonna get to that fucking stump and stop right you called the grizzly in on purpose coming into a moose call
*  Right. So, oh, no, I'm like, hey grab the cameras
*  Let's get this on video cuz he was looking for our moose calls
*  So this big bitch gets by that log and she stands up and she's looking around and I'm like, oh cool
*  You can hear my shutter on the video
*  Fuck it hit the ground it was coming and I'm like, oh well and immediately me I've been charged enough to where I'm
*  I'm an adrenaline junkie. Anyway, I'm desensitized and I'm like, well, he's gonna eat fucking this other dude
*  Anyway, so I'm like you can see my camera's shifting right a little as I'm taking these photos. I
*  Didn't have a weapon out of bow. And so here pretty quick. I'm thinking shoot this motherfucker. It's like 15 yards from us
*  Oh my god, he fired off around at its feet and I knew his gun jammed on the second round
*  Sometimes so I'm like
*  Piece of shit Brownie Abel doesn't jam on this second one or whatever it was right not saying a Browning's bad
*  Well, it stopped you remember and it came again. Mm-hmm
*  I think it's like 12 10 yards when it finally turned off and oh my god away, but 10 yards is nothing
*  Well, I tell you like mmm, that's almost like that wall
*  Yeah, it was big too. It's a big one. But I was that in BC. Yeah, it's in BC in in reality though
*  you talk to
*  Like bring up the Lancaster's or who I went with when I stayed in the NWT for that two months timeframe
*  Mm-hmm. Those guys live up there
*  I bet if you asked a Bart or a clay Lancaster how many times they've been blessed charged bluff charged
*  It's like triple digits like well just hunting with those guys the shit that they've done
*  Triple digits meaning a hundred times at a minimum and that's God
*  So like the like this the shit those guys deal with they've been doing it since birth, right?
*  And so I was telling them like like Amy and Frank. I was like, okay
*  You guys know how much I've done and all the different thing, you know, honey
*  And how many animals I put on the ground? It's a fraction clay Lancaster's been on
*  320 sheep hunts
*  320 that's a lot. That's not including caribou moose. He's been all over the world
*  The amount of experience those guys have and the stories like when I get those guys on the podcast
*  It's hilarious because I you know, I just got to experience the two and a half months section of it
*  We were literally from from a light bulb from a paved road
*  hours from any electricity like
*  It's a 12 hour drive to where the helicopter picks you up and then you're flown in another two hours
*  So when I got bit by that bite, it was funny by that bus spider. It was funny at first
*  Oh
*  yeah, fuck a bit by a spider up there and
*  My cake lay on my legs fucked up. I think I bit by something. He's like, ah, there's nothing poisonous up here
*  well my about fucking died my
*  My legs swelled up and we're drawing circles around it. Well the first couple circles, right wasn't that big of a deal?
*  so clay cuts it open and
*  Listen to the podcast. He's hilarious cuz he squeezed that thing and I acted like it didn't hurt
*  I thought I was gonna pass out from fucking chalk. So
*  Squeeze the puss out. Yeah, I don't know that it helped but it gave him pleasure spider was it
*  Man, you got to listen to the podcast here the whole story
*  But we ended up calling it the long cock black hobo spider and there's a story by side that but I think it was a hobo
*  spider
*  Those are dangerous. Yeah, but I don't think they're overly poisonous
*  I think I was allergic to it, but the moral of the story in six hours my leg locked up straight
*  There was veins going up towards my heart and I had cold sweats heart rate was racing
*  And clay's like dude, we got to get you out of here
*  You're gonna fucking die like we are a long long long ways from anywhere. How far?
*  Four hour helicopter ride, but then you're dealing with some fuck-up. She's doctor and northern part
*  Horses, you know where the fucking was doctor. It wouldn't have been good. So
*  I called my my buddy who's a medic and I was like, dude
*  What should we do? And he's like, alright piss on it bleach. I'd be profan fucking get some shit
*  Yeah, cuz I guess um, like bleach cleans everything out. Like he's giving me I can't remember Trump was right. I don't know what
*  Exactly, but I was like, holy shit. I was like, okay, so we're pouring pee on it
*  We're like crushing up ibuprofen and yeah, do you pour pee on it?
*  Do you let your buddy pee on it?
*  So here's the thing one of my buddies must have had a big Johnson cuz he was ready to pee on it right there
*  And I'm like dude pee in a fucking bottle
*  I don't see your wiener while you're peeing on my leg and so you wouldn't want it right off the tap
*  Somehow another it's better if he pees in a bottle and then pours it on you
*  It would have been awkward and think of the stories that have been told after
*  Way we're pouring pee on my leg
*  If you it was a matter of survival
*  Isn't that funny that you'd rather have a guy pee in a bottle and then pee and then pour that pee on you then pee on?
*  I guess looking at it that way. Yeah, I get it. I feel I'm right there with you
*  I understand your thought process. Well, I think I'd let the guy piss on me though at the time
*  I was like not overly worried and then when my leg locked up
*  It's what so it was if you measured my leg it gained two and a quarter in circumference inches
*  That's how much my legs swelled up. Oh, wow. So a lot. Yeah, it was I mean, I'm laughing about it now
*  But what was funny is once it went back down
*  We just duct tape towels around my calf muscle to go on moose hunts because it was so fucking painful
*  When the infection was going down because of the willows were beating it up and I'm like I really want to seize
*  70 inch wide moose. Let's just take we so we tape towels around my calf. So you never made it out of there
*  No, so you just dealt with it while you were in the woods. I went away in like a 24 hours
*  Oh, yeah, it wasn't that I wouldn't but you didn't think it was going to you thought you were gonna die
*  Yeah, I don't make it sound worse than it was
*  I got a little nerve wracking there towards the things my fucking heart started racing like
*  And I'm like, yeah, so your body's doing good
*  Infection infections are fucking dangerous. Well, I had veins going up my leg like you can see the veins are you saying?
*  That's what when we clay was talking about it cuz I was of course you have veins going up your leg
*  That's how you get blood. Yeah, and it showed them a lot
*  So they were they were blue or something look like an etch a sketch
*  Going up my leg dark. Yeah. Yeah dark. So you were worried that the infection was making its way to your heart
*  Well from what limited knowledge I had was that is this pretty much sure thing you're gonna fucking die
*  That's what I carry any
*  Antibiotics with you or anything when you go into a hunt like that
*  I do when I go to Canada now because of their weird government. I
*  Shouldn't even say this. I have friends that will prescribe them to me to take with me. Now last
*  in
*  18 I remember my hands looked like Deadpool's face from that milkweed or some shit
*  I was
*  Look shit that happens in the backcountry. What happened? So I'm on that mule deer hunt and
*  My hands are swelling up and I don't know why and and they look like Deadpool's face and I'm like
*  My hands I'm looking around like what could be around me. It's not poison ivy and my hands are swelling up like
*  Remember that movie?
*  Big trouble in little China. Yeah, the Asian dudes hands well up. Yeah. Yeah, I look like that
*  well as it turns out it's a
*  Hogweed or milkweed. I don't some fucking plant
*  That does that and if you if you now if you google it you pull it up
*  It's fucking nasty. But if you want to google
*  Hogweed on certain humans it has this crazy rash
*  inflammation
*  So my hands it's affected by sunlight. It's worse
*  So I'm at 13,000 feet and I'm on the spotter with my hands in the Sun all day
*  To a point like and at 13,000 13,000 feet the Sun is way stronger. Fuck. Yeah
*  Yeah, like you get really burnt up use a solar charger
*  It charges up your shit twice as fast because you're that close to the Sun
*  Is that really what it's from or is it just a lack? Oh my god. Look at that giant hogweed
*  Look at the hands. It wasn't good. Let me tell you so my shit
*  Look like those ones in the below that picture up in the right hand corner. That is crazy
*  The one the one that you see the large picture the one the yeah, look at that
*  What the fuck man that's from hogweed go to the go to the left
*  The one in the middle there. That's what my hands look like the one in the middle the left that one. Yeah
*  They look like that. So Frank comes over and he's like dude. What the hell is wrong with your hand?
*  I'm like, you know, that's a good good question. So we come out cuz I
*  Did it was bad and I go to the doctor right and I'm like, you know
*  I go to the emergency room and I'm like, hey, I what does that hogweed look like just so I know
*  Some people have gotten third degree burns from it. Whoa, it's it's not good. We see an image
*  Yeah, that's it that stuff that's beautiful. Yeah, and I was low crawling through that shit
*  Oh my god giant hogweed and it's toxic cousins
*  Wow, that's crazy. So but you those are the things you just don't think about right?
*  So I went and they gave me I don't know all kinds of steroid cream and shit and it went away in a day or two
*  And we pike back in it. This looks like a flower. I would have never imagined
*  I wouldn't this is just how did it get on both your hands your hands just rubbed up against it
*  Well, you figure it's there's big fields of it and I've got my bow hanging and I'm low crawling and
*  So to mitigate that what do you do do you wear gloves is there something you could put on your hands?
*  I don't know. I just look at fucking tall that shit is yeah
*  I just kept my hands out of the weeds the next year
*  God toxic giant hogweed plants show up in Duncan Lake
*  I don't you just made it too big Lake Cowichan Gazette. Hmm. Yeah, where's that Duncan?
*  No, look at the size that it's like fucking 9 feet tall. It wasn't that tall where I was at
*  It was three foot tall right about even with your hands. So perfect
*  Yeah, so just that weed has like some sort of an oil or something like that
*  That's what they said the doctor is an IV type deal. Yeah. Well, it's funny because when I went they had no idea
*  I'm like, hey my buddy from Alaska messaged me and he said dude, I think that's hogweed
*  I'm like what I'm the same reaction you did it fuck is hogweed
*  Googled it drove across the road Kaiser's whatever emergency room things like right across the road from Kaffaro
*  I drove over there and I'm like, hey, you know, I'm all screwed up and they're like what it you know
*  They don't know what it is and I'm like, hey, this is what I think it is
*  They googled it just like we did and they were like, oh well
*  That makes sense cuz they didn't know and then they gave me like this steroid cream to put on it
*  I don't know went away in a couple days
*  Jesus Christ, so between that and the bite what was worse? Oh the bite the bite was that much work?
*  I could have kept hunting with that. I just not knowing what it was. Well, we've been in there 12 days
*  I'm like guys about time to come out anyway, so right now what was crazy we came out a
*  couple days we go back in and
*  Frank's already got his deer we go back in and Frank I thought his appendix burst as it turns out
*  He just ate too much sushi and it got clogged up in his stomach
*  But Frank is harder than woodpecker lips we get on this these two deer
*  We're trying to get and he's not getting out of the tent and that's why Frank is not like that
*  He's like I hear him go sir. I'm gonna stay in a tent this morning and I'm like dude
*  You good now keep in mind Frank got pulmonary edema and that dumb shit hiked out with pulmonary edema
*  He literally his lungs filled up with liquid and that's an altitude sickness
*  Altitude sickness and that fucker hiked out nine miles with pulmonary edema. Jesus Christ
*  He when he got back he'd cough and it was like empty in a water bottle. Oh
*  He's a tough individual so I'm like dude this guy I even texted Amy I'm like, hey
*  Frank's fucked up. I might I might have to hit the beacon like I may have to I might have to help it out. So
*  Anyway, I go over I shoot this deer. So it's just sushi
*  So
*  Where did you guys eat sushi in Denver the day before?
*  So I think what had happened we had starved ourselves for 12 days, right?
*  Dehydration and he must in the woods in the woods we came out
*  You know
*  I took we all went out to dinner and I think he ate all that white rice and it just clung to his intestines like a
*  Woolly mammoth because it ended up just having to take a big poop, right?
*  But right in the middle where you know, your appendix is he's like it hurts right here and I've had gallbladder issues
*  I got I passed a kidney stone like six miles in so I was like
*  His appendix is erupt he's gonna die back here and so it's a show you how the you know, the
*  Moxie the Frank has he drug his ass out of that tent and film me shooting that mule deer and he hobbled his ass over
*  There after I shot it and it's fucking mile and a half from where he's glassing, you know flagging me in
*  And he just sat by the deer I cut it up whatever and I'm like dude I'll get most of it you good
*  And he's like, yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. And I'm like I can tell you're not fucking okay
*  like you're in pain and he made it out and then he took a giant poop and everything was okay, but it I
*  Thought he was gonna I thought was gonna have to hit the beacon. That's so bizarre that it was just from rice and poop
*  Well, we're not doctors, but that's what I chalked it up to. Yeah, maybe food poisoning sure wasn't food poisoning
*  He wasn't puking that was the only thing but again, I'm not a doctor but I every time I've had it I puked
*  So those are the worst experiences. What about injuries you ever get like really hurt out there?
*  Trying to think the kidney stone that was a bad one. You had a pissed that out. Oh fuck that was horrible
*  Um, how big was it? No
*  I'll tell the quick version of it
*  Think I was ten days into a hunt and I shot a mule deer we dehydrated fuck
*  Yeah, I did and I peed blood and courts like an idiot and I'm like, ah, it's fine
*  Whatever and got hike the mule deer out turn around. I I met a buddy dropped it off and then hike back in
*  And then like that night or the night after I was um
*  It was pretty high elevation. But anyway, I went after this bull and something like knocked loose in my kit
*  You know, I didn't know what it was
*  It's all of a sudden I had this shooting pain and I looked at that dude on the green mile trying to pee
*  Right and I'm like what?
*  Like I literally I'm like I'm gonna pass out from shock. What the hell is wrong with me?
*  Was it kidney stone? I didn't even I didn't know right?
*  I just I didn't it was so much pain in my back area that I had knew it had something to do with my kidneys, but
*  Every time I tried to pee I literally would drop me to my knees. And so I was like, okay
*  Let's assess this and I'm trying to think through should I take next to no gear and try and hike out
*  Take enough gear to stay the night but then have the burden of the weight
*  You know what what's gonna be the best option because I didn't have any service and I didn't have a
*  Beak I didn't have anything back with me that I could get ahold of anyone. And so I'm like fuck it. No guts
*  No glory. I grabbed the basic essentials and hobbled my ass out and at one point I did have a phone by them service
*  I I texted my buddy Tony and said hey, what is the nearest hospital to this trailhead?
*  And I lost service and so all he knew was I'm fucked up
*  Right
*  So I get to the trailhead and I get my Jeep and I had a giant Jeep and I'm doing like 90 down the road
*  And I get pulled over
*  Well, the cop was looking for me because my buddy had called and said I don't know what's going on
*  He's some way well a cop was kind of a dick, right?
*  He I get out and I'm like, hey, man, I'm he wanted to call an ambulance and I'm like look dude
*  I just hiked out six miles. I'm not paying $3,500 for a fucking ambulance ride. I just hiked six miles out
*  I can make it to the hospital
*  And so he was a little bit of a dick, but he followed me into the hospital and I passed it
*  I don't know click in the toilet think think think and it looked like a no, but it would look like a chicka pee
*  Chick pee. Yeah little spiky little bastard. Oh, okay. Yeah, it was horrible looking. Um, how big was it? Not very big
*  They're gonna be your dick hole. Holy moly man going through that. What was crazy is right after that. I was good to go
*  I mean once you passed it, I was fine
*  I went by hike back in the next day a lot of fighters get those from dehydration from weight cuts
*  And so I think Aldo Jose Aldo has gotten those before I think more than more than one fighters got no
*  I think what they told me my my buddy mine's a doctor when I was um, right it out
*  I was taking a lot of protein and different things that that there was a
*  Calcium buildup from that or something. I don't know. I'm not a not a doctor
*  Some people get them apparently from drinking too many green smoothies. It should be careful. I believe that
*  Which one is a
*  Thor Chris Helmsworth his brother his brother had to quit being a vegan
*  And that's one of the reasons why because he was he was passing these stones and
*  He had a wind up getting surgery
*  Here it goes
*  Australian actor Liam Hemsworth told men's health that he had to completely rethink his vegan diet after ongoing surgery surgery for a kidney stone
*  Some foods are high in substance called substances called oxalates which can increase the risk of kidney stones
*  These include spinach potatoes nuts and even chocolate. There you go. I've heard of it from kale, too
*  I eat a lot of kale. I re thunk my raw kale smoothies
*  I was drinking a lot of kale smoothies in the morning when I found out about the dangers of oxalates and I was like
*  Oh, I thought I was doing healthy. Yeah that well whatever mine came from
*  It was an eye-opener cuz that shit hurt but I've been pretty pretty lucky. I
*  You know as far as injuries and nothing IT band syndrome issue normal shit, right? I mean nothing too too crazy
*  No blown out knees out there or anything knees are great shoulders are great
*  That's what would scare the fuck out of me blowing out a knee in the backcountry and you got to figure out a way to get
*  In yeah, you know I like knock on wood, you know, I uh, I haven't had to I mean I've
*  Been in some hairy situation on cliffs where storms rolled in blacked out and just had to hunker down in like a cave
*  Right and just waited out but nothing nothing horrible
*  Your kidney stone was bad
*  But really like some of the things you'd think that would happen if I die back there
*  It's probably not gonna be from a bear and praying to fall off a cliff like that's the one thing I would guess would happen
*  That's how cams buddy Roy died. Yeah, was she punt serious?
*  That's a that that one there is probably worse than any the chances of having a bear eat you is so slim
*  But lightning and in cliffs are probably the worst ones. Yeah lightning is another fucking scary one, huh?
*  That's a normal experience out there. There's lightning storms
*  yeah, and in that one area that songwriter Christos is a mountain range and it's
*  Like scientifically worse there because of the heat from the ground and the cold from above the lightning storms there
*  We go down there just to photograph. What do you do if you're in a lightning storm?
*  Do you get near trees because if you get near trees, what if the trees get hit? I'm gonna give you horrible advice
*  I don't do shit. I just get my tent and
*  Really? So when there's a lightning storm, we just lay in your tent and hope it doesn't hit you
*  Well, I mean the reality of it is is as they blow over you may be causing and I'm not an expert at this
*  It's just I have the if it's my time
*  It's my time
*  So I just get in and I listen to an audiobook and it's not there
*  I and that is probably horrible advice, but the reality is my buddy
*  What audio book would you listen to when you're almost dying from a lightning storm the crow killer Jeremiah Johnson?
*  Yeah, yeah, I'd listen that one helps me go to sleep that dude's voice
*  Is what helps me go to sleep so but my buddy
*  Which I don't know if I can say his name
*  She's on an ODA team him and his buddy this fucking guys
*  Get hit with lightning in in the spot where we killed a bull and he texts me and he said something about this
*  Reminded me of I think he got hit with an RPG or something and I'm like, well, dude, are you good?
*  Like yeah, that's a hell of a build-up to a story with no finish, right?
*  He's got scars where the lightning came out of it's oh no
*  That's where it entered and then it blew the front of his or his buddies shoe out
*  What's fucking they hiked out hit him in the back and blew his buddy's shoe off because they hit him both at the same
*  Time and so I would guess they were probably more trained than I was and whatever they did didn't work. So anymore
*  Frank and I just hunkered down and I listened to an audiobook
*  Remi Warren got hit with lightning in high school if I remember correctly, and I think he lost a sense of smell
*  No shit, yeah something wacky like that
*  Remember that movie with what was it that big the big dude actor where the guy gets hit lightning?
*  He's like six times and he's like, oh you've been hit with lightning six times. He's like no
*  66 times you remember that shit John Candy. Yeah
*  Yeah, the great outdoors. Well, there's a guy that has been hit like a record number of times
*  There's one see if you find that
*  There's one dude for whatever reason they don't know what they don't didn't understand it
*  But he's been hit by lightning multiple times
*  It's not because he's looking for it like he's a he's particularly attractive to lightning for some strange reason
*  I think I'm particularly attracted how many times bears seven times good guy
*  Yeah, come on man, so Roy Cleveland Sullivan
*  He died in 1983 United States Park Ranger in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia between 1942 and 1977
*  Sullivan was hit by lightning on seven different occasions and survived all of them
*  I would I would go home and talk to my wife
*  So you should put some voodoo on that reminds me of that saying I have if it was raining pussy you get hit
*  With a dick that guy's bad luck. Yeah, that's horrible times. It's crazy. That doesn't even make sense
*  Yeah, I just I don't I just don't worry about it though anymore
*  What'd you say?
*  Ten odd no the guys I'll show you pussy
*  Put a fucking metal hat on yeah
*  It's just I think though you get desensitized to different things and lightning is definitely one where I just kind of hang out the tent
*  And it cooks you from the inside out like being in a microwave
*  He says man 61 survives being struck by lightning ten times Melvin Roberts made headlines in 2011 for being hit six times in one year
*  Wife said he's been struck another four times South Carolina man suffered memory loss headaches speech problems and has nerve damage in his hands and leg
*  Like I don't I'm so confused. I don't understand why it keeps hitting them. Let me see what that guy looks like
*  Yeah
*  He looks like a guy's been hit by lightning ten times
*  Yeah, excuse you'll blow the end of your toes off really yeah, and where a single lightning strike is made up of several
*  100 million volts
*  What the fuck man? Yeah, we've been on in lightning strikes where they hit trees close by it
*  Just blows them up and the shrapnel. It's pretty wild
*  How's it not kill people? Yeah, that's where it exited the toe. Oh Jesus Christ
*  Nerve damage in his leg and foot as a result of lightning strikes
*  Mm-hmm that might change your says Roy Sullivan is the current world record holder
*  And then he he was hit seven times. I gather we're talking about he died in 1983 by his own hand. Oh, no
*  That's not good
*  Yeah, you got to wonder like what's left after you've been hit seven times like your shit must be scrambled
*  I don't know man, but those are the things that'll probably get you you know like talking about
*  Yeah, bears is like the last thing I worry about light lightnings of it's a it's a real problem
*  What is there a way to get it to hit something else?
*  Like if you're in your tent would it hit the tent and not you or would it just go right through the tent?
*  I think you'd go through the tent
*  I saw it hit an old growth tree once and blow a hundred and eighty foot tall tree into pieces and I'm like
*  Oh, I did not look appealing. You know what should happen. Yeah, and that's not uncommon either
*  When you get when you because you get if you have service you can see where it's going, right?
*  Like the the one that passed two years ago
*  I knew Frank was fucked because it was going by me
*  Literally 400 yards and I'm watching cloud to ground and I'm like Wow texting Frank. I'm like dude buckle your shit up
*  It's coming and it went right in front of me and over Frank and you know Frank so funny
*  He literally called me. He's like, I'm okay, sir, and I'm like how'd it go?
*  He's like that was not cool and he had video of it striking, you know all around him
*  But the thing like he said is where's he gonna go? Cuz he's just running into a storm, right? You're not gonna outrun it
*  What do you do? What are you supposed to do?
*  Are you supposed to go into depression and hunker down is what you're into a depression. Yeah, I'm sort of a valley
*  What's it say Jim I was reading through Roy Sullivan's Wikipedia says he got struck two other times once when he was a kid
*  But it didn't hurt him. So he didn't claim it and then another time his wife got struck while he was helping her
*  With the clothes, but he didn't get hurt that time either. So I guess he didn't claim that time
*  What is he a fucking alien? Like why would one guy get hit so many times?
*  I'm trying to read what why it says but like it does there's no reasoning why or anything like that's so weird
*  Like what what about a person's biological makeup would be so different that lightning would be attracted to them
*  I don't know. He's got some serious static electricity. The thing is like with
*  You know the more you're out there
*  Epic shit happens. Well, I guess you might not consider it epic, but I mean the more he's a park ranger, right?
*  That's what I mean
*  Like you're out there and then you you know, you think about how much time I'm out there crazy shit's gonna happen if you're in
*  I mean, there's no well the Wolverine. Yeah, it's a one in a billion chance for that to happen
*  I mean that's literally but the more you're out there shit's gonna happen
*  Well Jordan story about the Wolverine stealing his his moose fat was hilarious
*  I know he had to one up me I was giving him shit about that
*  Right, like one of the only guys in history to shoot him with a recurve and he basically killed one of the hatchet
*  I'm like you son of a bitch, but he said he couldn't eat it though. So it was disgusting
*  Yeah, it's um, I had a lot of people you asked me to a lot of people ask me and I was like, yeah
*  I'm not eating that fucker. It's nasty. Um, but they're you know talking like with that with um, you know coyotes and stuff
*  I think we're in LA to coyote. Yes him and Remy Warren. They cooked a coyote data. It didn't seem that bad
*  Seemed edible. It's not for me. I don't you're starving. I've been starving. Yeah. Oh, yeah, I've eaten
*  Marmot on purpose marmot tastes good. You don't need the old ones are not so good. The marmot's like a rodent, right?
*  Yeah, yeah, those things pretty good
*  We call it Rocky Mountain fish and chips would catch cutthroat brook trout and eat marmot. They're really that good
*  No, they're not that good. But I've had beaver Renella cooked up beaver. It was actually pretty good
*  It wasn't the tail. It was the hindquarters. Oh, no kidding. Yeah, he cooked it. It was like a beef stew
*  He braised it and then slow cooked it in a crock pot. It was actually very good. Like we were stunned
*  It was quite delicious. Yeah, I've had beaver but to tail more than anything. It's weird, right?
*  Which I was gonna say it's very fatty is what it is, but yeah, it's like a fat sandwich
*  Yeah, I mean I get the idea of um, you know, they eat what you kill or whatever
*  But I also get the idea that wolverines eat the shit out of they'll clear a base on a mountain goats and sheep out in
*  A minute. Did I did you hear the whole story that fucker bit the arrow in half on the third arrow and
*  Charged me after biting in half Jesus Christ. Yeah, it's pretty crazy. It was cool
*  It's a wild little animal man
*  I mean they're in the badger family and that you know, honey badger don't give a fuck is pretty famous
*  Oh, you know how many memes I got a honey badger. Don't give a shit. No fuck. It's crazy
*  Wild little animal too. Just the way it looks doesn't even look like a real thing
*  Yeah, what was crazy cuz they were fighting when we saw them and so we stuck down in on them
*  I was like, you know feared we were 30 yards away and all of a sudden we
*  Jesus Christ, they're like 14 yards away. Yeah, I've seen them chase off wolves from from kills. It's crazy
*  Seeing them in video at least. Yeah, it's a wild little animal
*  It's just so funny how something so small can be so ferocious. Look at that fucker. Look at that face
*  Yeah, I saw it like it's six yards on my third arrow. That's a honey badger. Yeah Wolverines real similar
*  They're just just any kind of badger. So such a strange animal
*  They are and I guess there's a lot of them up in that mountain range. Well, I know they're encourage you to
*  You know, whatever shoot them because they're hard on the ungulates
*  Do they encourage you to they encourage you to take them out because they they killed it
*  We'll get that one with his mouth open in the middle that low down. Yeah, look at that fucking a man
*  Yeah, their faces look at his fucking face. That doesn't even look like a real face
*  Dude, I should send you mine. You can put it in here and like every time you look at it scare the shit
*  I got though. I kept the whole hide. I just you know when I when we were in there, it was like that's me
*  I'll put it right there next to that chimps that fake this thing
*  This is a Shane against the machine on Instagram made me this. Oh, no shit
*  Yeah, it's a champ skull that he made out of zilgen symbols
*  No, it looks like it says zilgen on the back reminds me that movie Congo. Oh
*  Right. Yeah bad gorilla. Remember that to me. Yeah, do you know why they you know, what's interesting about that?
*  That's a Michael Crichton book, right? Isn't it Michael Crichton? Yeah
*  What's interesting about that is?
*  I thought he was just making that up, but there is a giant chimp in the Congo
*  There's a giant kid. They called the Bondo ape. It's huge. It's like six feet tall. They've caught him on camera traps
*  There's a I think he's from Sweden or Switzerland
*  I forget a wildlife photographer named Carl Amman and he was obsessed with these things
*  He saw one once I believe and then he set up all these camera traps
*  He spent years in there trying to document this thing because there's an enormous
*  Chimpanzee like a subspecies of chimpanzee that lives in the Congo in this place called Billy and you got photos of it
*  Yeah, they have photos they have camera traps these two guys who live there shot one near an airfield
*  Landing strip. It's huge. It's like a six foot tall chimp be equivalent of seeing Bigfoot, right?
*  Yeah, if I ever saw it, I certainly want to go find it more
*  I don't necessarily think Bigfoot exists
*  But if I saw one I'd certainly want to go find it
*  This one's really trippy because it sleeps on the ground like a gorilla
*  It's a mess. Yeah, they nest on the ground and they they caught one eating a leopard
*  They don't know if it killed the leopard or if it was just eating a leopard that was already dead
*  But you can imagine how strong a chimp is now imagine how strong a 200
*  I mean not 206 six foot tall probably more than 200 probably three or four hundred with the densest muscle mass known to man
*  That's stay the fuck out of the jungle. The crazy thing is they have camera trap photos of one walking upright
*  Oh, no, yeah walking it. See if you find that the guys Carl with a K arm on
*  He's this wildlife photographer that got obsessed with this animal because they were you know
*  A lot of people were claiming bullshit for the longest time on this
*  There's photos of one that someone had shot from the 1920s and they were trying to figure out if it was a hybrid
*  It was a gorilla chimp hybrid if that's possible. See that's the one that's the camera trap on the far left
*  So you see it walking that that fucker was walking on his hind legs
*  It's huge and now go back to where you were see that one right beside it on the left
*  That's the dead one up up top up top. Yeah right there. That's the one that they shot at a
*  Landing strip they shot near an airport. Look at the size of his hog. Good Lord. Good Lord
*  Oh, we get the size of that fucker
*  You don't know how big the men are behind it, but you know, I mean even if they're five seven
*  That's a that's a six foot enormous chimpanzee and then the one in the middle the black and white one Jamie
*  Over that yeah that one that is the original photo from really really early on
*  I think that was the early 1900s people were trying to figure out what the fuck that was
*  It was like it's really big for a chimp because these guys are trying to hold it up
*  And you know, its legs are still dragging on the ground. So if it was standing up on its hind legs
*  It probably as tall as them
*  Good Lord. Yeah crazy. So it is an actual chimp. There's another one to that one right next to it
*  Jamie above right above where your cursor is
*  Down and to the right that one. I
*  Mean, this is a fucking enormous animal. Oh, yeah
*  That's like the the big foot of the jungle
*  I mean imagine a
*  400 pound chimp six foot tall 400 pound chimp like what the fuck so this guy Carl Amon
*  a M ma and n has been
*  Photographing these things for years and set up these camera traps. They have two different types of chimps
*  They call them tree beaters and lion killers. The tree beaters are the ones look at that one in the middle. It's standing up
*  Fuck you
*  Look at that thing
*  Goddamn, that's crazy. If you could watch what a normal chimp does physically that's pregnant pretty impressive what that thing can do
*  Yeah, I mean they throw themselves through the air with their arms literally just throw themselves and catch a tree
*  That's why they hang from it
*  So this is a so that's why that Congo movie was so weird
*  Like it's kind of sort of loosely based on an actual real chimp
*  Yeah, and they get real great looking too, which is also true just like his book
*  Yeah, I was gonna say in the movie they had the gray. Yeah, those get they get real gray when they get big sort of
*  Like gorillas they also have a crest on their head like gorillas that this see this chimp this fake chimp skull that he made
*  This is a normal chimp skull, but the ones that they found that's why they got so confused these
*  Bondo apes they actually have a crest like they have this big thick partition at the top of their head and the skull
*  That usually like with bears. That's a an age right when they get that butt crack in their foreheads
*  Thick muscles that they can crush moose bones with yeah, it's crazy
*  I it is pretty wild watching what some of the like this like I got hit by a black bear once running just clip me
*  He was running scared, but I he hit me and I was like, oh that was that was definitely a reality check of where I'm running
*  Like jogging. Oh fuck. No, I was in the trail and he ran by me and clipped me
*  Oh, and it wasn't like this crazy. I mean, it's just ran you over accidentally. Fuck man
*  He hit me and that was a that was a reality check of where I stand out in the food chain
*  Fucking 600 pound linebacker. I mean it blew me back and he clipped me on the side, but it happened so fast
*  Right went and literally it took me a second to like Jesus
*  20 hit me he was running scared, right?
*  It was just a happenstance thing but South got attacked by one when he was young South Cogs
*  Yeah when he was young, but it really shows you like well, I have a matrix target you like those. Mm-hmm
*  That fucking bear at my house pushed the center octagon out he doesn't have a postable thumbs
*  He didn't release the ratchet straps and he was managed to push the middle portion out
*  I probably had peanut butter on my hand and I was pulling arrow and you smelled it
*  Yeah, and he was able to push that center octagon out and that was 180 pound little black bear
*  So imagine what a you know 500 pound black bear could do to you
*  Well, when you see him run up trees just just use their claws and just run up the tree and full clip
*  Like you would run on the ground but faster and they go up a tree that way. Oh, yeah, what a week
*  I uh, yeah, it is it's pretty crazy that that one I got that one that charged me two years ago
*  guys man that thing was like I hit it two times coming at me here and here and
*  I was shitting my knickers, right? I mean the first time I hit it
*  I was like, oh like running backwards and I wasn't I was pooping my pants right?
*  And then it took off and started stomping the ground
*  I huffed at it again and came in again and I was not ready the second go-around either and I hit it here and then
*  It ran off broadside night. Anyway, I ended up killing it
*  But it was hilarious because my my buddy was like, hey, did you get a shot?
*  Cuz he couldn't see in the timber and I'm like, dude, I'm out of arrows. What happened? I don't think he believed me
*  We got up there. I'm like, dude, it's a big bear and I said, did you hear it?
*  And he said I could hear it stomping and I was like, did you hear it fucking try to eat me?
*  And he was like, did it really? I'm like, no, it didn't try to eat me
*  I was like but Jesus and he you know looked there's kind of react to you know, reenacting telling him what happened
*  It was a trip man, but those I was wearing black. I stood when I thought that you were a bear
*  so when that snow melts the
*  You know King King of the Apes right the the biggest bears guard the luscious grass
*  right
*  and so when I stocked in I actually pulled my camera off and I put on black fleece because it was in a field and
*  I was on my hands and knees and he'd feed and I'd get closer and he'd feed and I got to 35 yards and
*  He wheeled out right when I shot and he went into the timber and I was like damn it
*  And then I could hear him in there popping his teeth and I'm like, oh he wants some
*  So I load an arrow and just dove into the timber and I started huffing at him and that's a dominance thing
*  You finally you did that to get him riled up. Why would you do that? Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time, right?
*  Looking caught up in the moment
*  Well, fuck it be honest with you I've never had one it come at me that fast
*  Usually they'll just stand up there and they'll stop so you thought you were gonna bluff him and then he would be there for a shot
*  Yeah, and it didn't quite turn out like I had planned it and he came straight at me and I so I started like oh
*  That's fucking bad idea and I started running backwards and I shot but it was I don't from here to the TV and I hit it
*  Well, I thought okay that should slow him down. I'll get in that well fuck
*  It just pissed him off. So he ran out there at 20 yards and started stomping the ground
*  so
*  That this point time I was a bit caught in the moment and I'm not trying to make this sound
*  Any more than me being a dumb fuck so I started huffing at it again
*  And he came straight at me one more time and I hit him on the other side
*  Well, it's funny is is Gary, you know, it's like hey, did you get a shot?
*  And I was like, yeah, dude, you would not believe this and you could tell he was like, yeah
*  Whatever we get in there and this thing's got one arrow sticking out of here one here and one through the lungs and it was
*  Fucking crazy seven foot four
*  It's a weird animal to eat to you know, the rivets taught me how delicious they can be
*  John and Jen rivet really know how to cook them and especially on a Traeger. They'll smoke cook
*  That's what we did cook a ham. It's unbelievable. Why so good. I get a kick out of the hate mail I get about
*  Predators right because we we eat them like mountain lions unbelievable
*  it's not as good as axis steer but it's pretty damn good and it's like just because
*  It's weird that you get less hate mail from a deer then then you do something you can I know because it seems like if you're
*  Killing an animal like a mountain lion you're doing it because you want to be a badass
*  Yeah, that's what it is
*  So but if you kill an animal like a deer like that's normal people are accustomed to people killing deer for food
*  I had people like oh those are endangered
*  I kill a giant mountain lion and and I've killed a bunch of bears like they're endangered and it's like no
*  There's actually kind of a problem right because California they're not endangered at all. It's you hear that talk all the time
*  There's at Tahoe and ranch. They have one particular camera trap where they caught 16 different mountain lions on a pond
*  Yeah, they're a problem and they they'll eat, you know, they'll eat two and a half deer a week
*  Pretty easily and so a mountain lion
*  But you think like people think you can't eat and there's some predators you price shouldn't eat
*  But again in the big picture, which I do not understand how people think
*  They eat everything else and so to be truly not the hashtag conservation
*  But if you're worried about other animals, you have to keep everything in relative check
*  Yeah
*  there's a weird thing that people have though when it comes to predators like there was a woman who ran an alpaca farm in
*  Malibu and she had this one particular mountain lion that had found her farm
*  irresistible and
*  Slaughtered a bunch of them and killed a couple of goats too
*  And she got a depredation permit to kill this thing
*  And the amount of death threats that she got when they found out that she was gonna kill this mountain lion or was
*  Told that she got a permit where she could hire someone to take this mountain lion out
*  And so she eventually wound up not doing it just out of fear and she was just scared
*  But meanwhile, they don't have any problem with this thing
*  Really thrill-killing it was just thrilled. It can't help itself
*  Yeah, once it found out that it could get into that pen where the alpacas were it just was slaughtering them
*  Yeah, the the the you at well not just us here. It's kind of weird
*  So put things in perspective things don't think about this if you shoot an animal and you don't pack it all out
*  You get a ticket for wanton waste right and and honestly, I mean you do about like rib meat
*  Do they call them on rib meat as well every state's different
*  So in Colorado you have to take four quarters and neck meat some place
*  You don't have to take rib meat some places you do you think about it?
*  How much food do you think was wasted in California yesterday beef?
*  How much was thrown away the people didn't finish their meals their steak was cooked medium-rare
*  The animal was alive once and they throw it away
*  Yeah, weird how people look at that that is weird
*  But it's it's like the thing of you going out and doing it yourself
*  And they're what I think they're really worried about someone shooting a deer and just taking the antlers, which is no
*  No, I guess that portion of it. I don't get the other portion like right get like well
*  I got three tonight 500 pounds of meat a year, right? It's it's a big deal for me
*  What's crazy to me is this some dude that just let his kid throw his entire steak away because it didn't taste good
*  It's gonna give me crap for shooting a deer that I'm gonna eat the whole thing. Well, that's human though
*  You know humans are we're real complicated animals
*  They're so we're real bizarre and what we can justify and not justify, you know
*  And that's it's one of the things you're seeing, you know, if someone's walking around without a mask
*  You know on the street people will yell at them and tell them you're putting me in danger
*  But you will see and a massive protest and it gets nothing but
*  Positive responses from the news and the media and like this is amazing people are unifying
*  Yeah, this is amazing. But it's also amazing that two weeks later. There's a giant spike in
*  Covid and no one wants to I something I've read though that there is a big spike in Covid
*  But there's not a corresponding death spike. Yeah, I read the same thing. Yeah, see that's true
*  Because they said that Covid is spiking but deaths aren't which is really interesting because that must mean that they're better treating it or
*  maybe people have a better understanding of
*  How to survive it or maybe the people that are getting it are younger
*  Because a lot of them are getting it specifically from the protests, which they're kind of denying
*  Seems hilarious, which is weird. Yeah the whole thing. I'm trying not to read it because they just get depressed people on top of each other
*  I'm 100% support the protests 100% but people on top of each other you tell me if they're sick
*  They're not gonna give it to each other. That seems highly unlikely. Yeah, a lot of doctor
*  But there's just a lot of con contradicting
*  Yeah, use of that like you can't protest certain things
*  But you can protest other things and then when Covid first kicked off six feet wear a mask whatever and then I see these things
*  Where you know, there's this six foot thing, but we do we don't mind if you protest and it was exactly
*  Everything was strange to me and well, there's a big gay pride
*  Protest this or celebration this weekend in Chicago same thing everybody on top of everybody and everybody's like this is wonderful unity
*  Okay, but you know two weeks when the restaurants in the bar shut down again, we're gonna question our decisions
*  Yeah, it's a you ever watch like zombie land. That was funny. Yeah, that is our first to go right?
*  I bring that up all the time think about how bad would it be to rewind?
*  80 years like what would happen like how how
*  Soft we are as a as a culture now. It's pretty amazing and then like, you know, you think about some of the different plagues
*  You know, I I read and listen. Well, I already shit. I listen a lot of audiobooks me too
*  I like to say I read though sounds better. It does for me too. The reality is I don't read shit
*  I look at pictures, but I love magazines. Yeah, even read articles online. I read articles. I'll read some articles, especially on my phone
*  I'll pull them up. But yeah, but I rarely read books
*  I fall asleep when I read them, which I pray should read more but I you know when I when I look at
*  all of the different
*  Everything that's going on nowadays
*  Like if there was any major actual real major crisis like how fucked we would be as a society is pretty amazing
*  Well, it's like we were talking about our dietary choices. The fact that 70% of Americans are overweight and it's so crazy
*  That's so no this is such a weird time in terms of how easy life is without you know pre-covid
*  Yeah, and that people had gotten accustomed to this soft way of living
*  Yeah, so when someone does something like what you do what you prefer to do, that's what makes it so extraordinary
*  Someone uses that ridiculous
*  farmers walk farmers carry machine and here it is as us coronavirus coronavirus cases spike
*  Country will be seeing more deaths. Dr. Fauci says that guy
*  There will be going up is what it says. I understand that. Dr. Fauci is a medical expert and a good man
*  But I am annoyed at him
*  For what he said about the masks because he literally said that we told people not to wear masks
*  So that they wouldn't buy them so that health care experts can get them
*  You can't do that. You can't do that because then you we know you're lying at one point in time
*  Can't lie if you can say please don't buy masks because health care workers need them
*  Instead get a bandana instead take an old t-shirt
*  Convert it into a bandana. Please say that please in the future
*  Don't lie to us because when you lie then we think you're lying no matter what ability exactly
*  Especially when it's about something like that
*  Like I understand they were probably compelled him to do that
*  But man that confuses the fuck out of everybody because there's this video
*  That you know him talking about you don't have to wear a mask and it's like then a couple weeks later
*  They're like actually you have to it's mandatory
*  Yeah, the whole cove it thing is a different it's different
*  I know well, and I think you sent me a text or something
*  I thought man this is blown out of proportion and I think you said definitely for people like like like with me
*  yeah, and one of the you know one of a I
*  I
*  If everybody was like you it would be a bad cold
*  Yeah, I hope you don't get it
*  But if you do take a lot of vitamin C drink a lot of liquids get a lot of rest
*  But the problem is you know obese people diabetics older folks
*  And that's what I don't want to beat a dead horse to death, but I really really would like you know not sound too
*  What's the word liberal tree hugger ish like I really wish bottled water as we're drinking it
*  I'd like to see more options for filling up an algae
*  I would like to see more options for people for health like right God forbid
*  We spend all this money on stuff like it wouldn't be horrible for the government to spend money and get some free
*  Dietitians out and say I mean I don't have a plan for this
*  But knowing as a converted fat kid like fuck
*  I wish I had some help when I was younger remember when Trump had that lady that was telling everybody not to touch their
*  Face, and then she licked her finger and then turned the page. Yeah
*  That's but that's when you know when we're talking about health experts and things along those lines
*  That's the kind of shit that you see sometimes
*  And it just makes you go God people are so weird just human beings are so we're so weird what we concentrate on and what's
*  Important to us so strange well where you're from New York, right? I was born in New Jersey, but most of
*  My from 13 on I grew up in Boston not to turn the reverse the roles here
*  But what made you get into hunting well?
*  I see I had seen a bunch of those PETA videos
*  And I was like I'm gonna do one or two things either
*  I'm gonna become a vegetarian or I'm gonna become a hunter yeah
*  And then Renella took me hunting on a show and I dropped a mule deer the moment the deer dropped
*  I was like okay. I'm doing this from now on and then the moment we ate it by campfire
*  I'm like this is the best meal
*  I probably ever have in my life
*  And it just made me realize like we cooked it
*  We left some of it in it we hung it up in a tree because it was pretty late when we shot it
*  we took the organs and then we fried up some liver and onions and we fly it fried up some heart and
*  By the by the campfire, and I remember thinking while I was eating that like this is the most satisfying meal
*  I've ever had in my life. This is how I'm gonna live from now on so take that and multiply it by a hundred
*  That's how I feel with a recurve. I don't know how else to explain it. I mean it
*  It's just I mean something about watching that arrow fly through the air after all that hard work now
*  You may want to snap that fucker in half several times on the way to finally hitting an animal right but being a guy
*  I'm driven. I'm goal oriented. You know I really like the challenge. I like to practice. I like all that
*  I get it totally get it
*  I would imagine that the connection is so much more intense than even with a compound bow because you're dealing with all the
*  cams and the
*  Well, I'm getting hearing and all that noise right getting closer like the different things you have to do it is hard for me
*  to explain to you know to
*  Have a little bit different perspective because I've come from that the compound side being able to I shot my caribou at 127 yards
*  I've gotten bashed for that right, and I'm like a crazy shot
*  But if you trying to shoot a caribou like a lot of times you can't get very close
*  Yeah, we just we couldn't get close, but I you know without me getting bashed too much about shooting long-distance now
*  I really I mean getting sub 10 yards from an animal is pretty freaking cool
*  I mean imagine it is and you know when people thinking about trying it out
*  Might give it a try right when one thing good
*  You can do with your kids do you ever get to a point where you like I'm gonna make my own arrowheads
*  Fuck no not yet. I'm gonna cut my own sticks and whittle my own arrows like I
*  Full-on Comanche I've had a lot of people message me about that and
*  And Amy right now I can tell you that I like I am very accurate that well
*  We just shot that tournament with some you know Luke in the group and the compound trad
*  Luke was like so
*  Happy because at the end he asked a bunch of compound guys what their scores were so he could give them shit because mine was higher
*  Because they're everybody was giving him shit about how you let her and beat you with a stick bow
*  And he's like you know screw you guys you come do it because I've taken a bunch of money from him
*  I like that accuracy even though it's not where I was with a compound
*  I
*  Don't know that I'll never
*  Build my own bow, but I would say the chances are highly unlikely
*  I'm pretty happy where I'm at right now building a bow by yourself
*  You mean cutting the wood and actually constructing a bow out of the wood probably yeah, and probably the best guy that
*  Clay Hayes is a real traditional dude. He's so not even a recurve. He's using like a regular self
*  Cut out of his front yard
*  Would use for that
*  Well they have boat art trees, which is actually I don't know what the real
*  Osage maybe is what a boat art trees anyway
*  I'm not an expert at this shit, and I don't plan on being I mean I got aluminum riser right now
*  It's what what am I talking about, but the thing is it's crazy
*  Well when you use a no traditional bow, but it's made out of aluminum like I know right
*  Yeah, I was just gonna say I get a time for it. Do you really?
*  You you always say I get hate mail all the time for you
*  And I always say why you reading that shit you're right, and I will say you have been a good influence because I probably in the last
*  Five years I have really gotten to a point where it takes a lot for me to get any engagement or any
*  Rise out of it. I just read them and laugh because I'm like yeah, well whatever that's your opinion
*  But the problem is with me not problem. I answer so many tech questions
*  I try to be super involved with our customers as well as guys that need help
*  So you have to read some emails and some and some of my just laugh messages, but I will say like
*  Like that stupid trad vein I came up with it's not stupid. I thought that would be good for the community
*  Fuck no like I got so I don't know what you're talking about. It's just a it's a vein
*  You can shoot out of a call I mean the feathers for people to know the feathers for the arrows so feathers are for
*  Generally traditional archers shoot feathers and they do that because it has to contact the riser and flattens out easier flattens out
*  So it's more accurate. Yes exactly because you don't get to bounce off the shirt
*  well, it would with a plastic vein like you do with a compound bow because the
*  It hits the shelf and bounce drop you get contact bounces off. So I
*  Had that goat hunt. I got a hold of the guys at AE and I said, okay, let's get this
*  I don't care if you sell them. I just want them. Well, I thought that would have been this is how weird the traditional archery
*  Community is for me
*  I thought that would be a positive for guys that do backpack hunts and and it was for a lot of guys
*  I got I
*  Made the mistake of reading a few online traditional archery forums about myself and that was a bad idea
*  Because I was like the devil because those veins
*  To come they want them to be feathers. Yeah, I'm like the Antichrist or something
*  I don't know they wanted to be feathers because it's traditional traditional
*  Yeah, and even though the wood is made from a CNC machine their riser and their limbs have carbon in them
*  No, people are weird
*  People are weird with when and especially when people get into tradition the traditional things
*  They get very strange. Yeah, and I don't man like with me
*  I don't care if you hunt in pink underwear and use a whatever the hell Dave and Goliath
*  Whatever the boats you do whatever that makes you happy
*  I just want people to get outdoors and get off the couch
*  But you know everybody has different opinions and perspectives and whatever else but for for me
*  That was just a tool that increased my opportunity while I was out there, but it was definitely frowned upon by some
*  Yeah, so fuck them. Yeah, don't you think that this would be a really good?
*  Time for some sort of hunting education like a like a program that people can enter where they could be taught like
*  Adult onset hunting like people who are adults learn how to do it someone take you out
*  I mean, I know there's a few people that do similar things out there
*  But man, it would be real nice, especially when you know when kovat happened and people realize like hey this
*  Food supply chain is a little sketchy
*  I
*  Don't really have any toilet paper here, and you know I went my buddy went to the grocery store
*  He said there was one package of ground meat. That was all that was there. Yeah, and I was like yeah, man
*  That's that could go sideways. It was pretty crazy some of my neighbors that were not keen on me
*  Taking my own animals and all the food I had in the deep freezer
*  That all of a sudden wanted to come they were not keen on it like did they tell you they weren't keen on it?
*  Yeah, you can see they're pretty down on it. You know like say something to you
*  You know other than like yeah, I'm not into hunting like that
*  Kind of underlying you know go fuck yourself you shot an animal and but they ate meat you know so I whatever however
*  You want to look at that and then when weirdest kovat hit because I do I eat four or five hundred pounds a year pretty
*  easy of meat
*  Maybe more than that plus you know I give my daughter and whatever anyway I
*  Some of them had come over and we're like hey can we try some of that like yeah?
*  I don't you know I'm always gonna encourage people to try it and then now it's obviously worked out because they're addicted to it
*  They love it. What you clean it. Yeah, it's so good for you, too
*  It just feels better when you eat it you like you eat a real nice elk steak like you get like energy
*  It's weird. It's hard to describe to people it is and I mean you also have like for me the the fact that I you know
*  The way I the way I got it it just adds to the whole experience
*  It's hard to explain, but I think that as a whole like land navigation
*  You know how to break down an animal you know animal behavior
*  Yeah, that'd be a hell of a class that I think wouldn't be a horrible time. Yeah, I think it would be great for people
*  I mean, I wouldn't say do it with archery
*  I would say do it with a rifle you know especially people that don't have any experience in it, but I think there'd be
*  Incredibly rewarding it's not something that everybody can do well people always say that when you talk about hunting as being a method of acquiring your meat
*  Like hey, we don't have to factory farm hunting is still a possibility people go well
*  You know you can't feed everyone with hunting and they're right you really can't but guess what everyone's not gonna do it
*  Yeah, it's like everything else. It's like you know the whole world can't go to jujitsu class. It would be too packed
*  Yeah, that's good because most people are not gonna do it anyway. It's too hard the same thing with
*  Lifting weights the same thing with yoga. It's the same thing with anything that's difficult
*  Difficult things do not attract people they attract some people yeah attract people that are interested in challenges
*  Yeah, and I I would say the only thing if you did that you probably want the shooting of the weapon to be the last
*  Portion because a lot of people would want to just do that and then buy right you know you
*  Earn your way to that and you have to have a curriculum right? Oh, yeah
*  Well, and I talk about that easy button that people hit all the time
*  One of the things I got most thankful for is I came up with a time with no rangefinder
*  I had to learn to range right and how did you range with no rangefinder? Did you learn how to like?
*  Like recognize actual distance of things by thinking of it in terms of like body sizes like what it first it was a tape
*  We'd measure and you know what I mean you'd you'd roll it out
*  And we would have different courses or whatever and when I say we didn't have rangefinders
*  Right when I started there was like a Bushnell 500 the thing was the size of this freaking notebook. It was giant. It was a
*  mono an ocular
*  And that was like the first one and then they had some other ones that they were probably available to people had a lot
*  Of money, but you would be pacing it out
*  My step is a yard and so I measured out or we were at a range and I'd make sure how far everything
*  What you know I would pace it out
*  So I would guess the yardage and I would pace it guess the yardage and I would pace it
*  I've heard of archery competitions where they don't let you use a rangefinder. So here's the thing with that and and
*  So we talked about Levi before you know
*  Levi Morgan has shot higher scores at times on unknown 3d courses where the known
*  3d course had a shot a lower score and those guys had rangefinders. That's how good that dude is so when you say unknown you mean
*  3d courses where you can't use a rangefinder, so you're shooting at targets and you have to guesstimate
*  Yep, and he guesses the yardage and there's another class shoots from the same stakes and they get rangefinders
*  Levi has beaten them with no rangefinder. That's how fucking good that guy is
*  So when people talk about because you get guys like I would say
*  Me and cam not a tournament guy cam shooting 160 yard shots
*  We've got great shot or even Dudley Dudley amazing shot, but then you look at a Levi Morgan if you dig into him
*  13 asa world championships in a row that that guy was pretty crazy. He's still shooting today
*  And then you think he's hitting fucking quarters not knowing the distance out of 50 yards
*  Something that competitive 13 years in a row means it's hard to believe well, I mean I
*  About the time like my wife is making my head too big
*  I'll pull up a YouTube and have her watch an asa with like a Gillingham and Levi or Dan McCarthy
*  And I'm like these guys are good, honey. I'm just okay like these guys are fucking unbelievable. It's an obsession, right?
*  Archery is a weird Zen obsession like the the feel I try to explain to people like if I never hunt it again for the rest
*  of my life if I never
*  Never even ate meat for the rest of my life. I would definitely shoot bows and arrows
*  Yeah, definitely practice archery because there's something that happens when you concentrate on that target and the shot process and the shot breaks
*  And then arrow sinks right into where you're looking at. It's amazing. It's a it's a beautiful feeling that's extremely rewarding
*  I don't uh
*  It would be hard for me. I I mean what happened with me when I did that switch right when I was
*  You know it I found a new love for archery that I had lost because the newness ran away and i'm not saying I was
*  You know perfect at it
*  but you can pick up a compound and and uh, you know shoot it and and skip a week and and still be pretty damn good with
*  It right, you know that stick bow. You got to shoot it all the time. So I got to a point where
*  15 years ago
*  I would take work off and call in sick to set up my new bow
*  Like I was always been addicted to archery and then later on down the line that newness wore off where now
*  Well, i'm the boss so I don't have to call in sick
*  I am so I mean literally a kid at a christmas waiting for shit to come in with that recurve
*  So it it rejuvenated that love for for archery
*  And it kicks the shit out of you and so that challenge, you know when I say kicks shit out of you that challenge of practicing
*  It's pretty addictive I was actually surprised you haven't tried it more yet, but you may not have
*  Yeah, I just don't have the time. I know what it is. It's I know that it's gonna take
*  X amount of hours every single day. Yeah, and i'm scared. It's like the same reason why I won't play golf
*  Yeah, like I know me i'm not doing that
*  I'm not walking around for eight hours a day because then that would be doing it every day and everything else would suffer
*  That's why I don't do crossfit to be honest with you because i'm super competitive. Fuck. I fucking hate to I just watched that
*  Documentary this is a crossfit documentary. I forget what it's called. It's the fittest or something like that. It shows the competitions
*  It's like fucking bonkers, man. Did we just we had matt chan on the other day?
*  He's um took second in 2012 in the crossfit games. I'm not a crossfitter
*  So I don't know all the different shit, but I mean he's fit that's for sure
*  But I i've told frank i'm like dude i'm not good at not
*  Giving everything I have and one i'll probably fuck myself up physically, you know trying too hard
*  But two the time to put into that with everything else i've got going on my workout program's fine, you know
*  So i'm like dude, I got enough irons in the fire
*  I don't want to dive into the crossfit arena and get consumed by that as well as many other things even photography takes time
*  And all that shit all your hobbies take time. So I don't cry the crossfit thing too
*  I know too many people that have hurt themselves
*  Yeah, they get too they push too hard and they hurt them. I was just reading an article about a guy
*  Who's a crossfit trainer? We got rabdo
*  Rabdo myelosis
*  Oh, no shit. Yeah crossfit trainer. He's like i'm a crossfit instructor and I got robdo from a crossfit workout
*  But you just you know
*  You're pushing yourself so hard with all those reps and you're doing it trying to keep up with all the people that are in
*  The class with you I get it's great for you
*  But for morons like me probably not the best move
*  I i'm going to agree with you in that more on category on my end because a moron like me like I literally like
*  Frank and I are competitive, you know, we're not competitive, you know
*  We both want to do good
*  If I go into a crossfit gym and frank beats me it's not like i'm gonna go home back. Oh shucks
*  I lost my mother and i'm gonna go, you know, full ape shit. So
*  It is again I get you know guys get pissed or whatever about you know me
*  I'm not talking shit about crossfit. I'm saying I do not
*  I would probably slack on form because of whatever the lot or whatever it's called for the day
*  I probably chintz on form and fuck myself up. Look, I know you can fuck yourself up doing everything and I fuck myself up doing jujitsu
*  multiple times i'm not saying you should do it but
*  You know, i've talked to people that are real like legit trainers like steve maxwell who said
*  He doesn't like it because it's lifting weights as a sport
*  He goes lifting weight should be something you do that enhances sport. He goes particularly when you're doing olympic movements
*  He's like olympic movements shouldn't be done to maximum repetition. He's like they should be done controlled and they should be done
*  You know a low number of reps and you're just trying to build strength
*  But everyone's got their own thought process and when you look at those guys in those uh competitions
*  And the girls the girls scare the fuck out of me
*  There's some of those girls are built like fucking gorillas like yeah, it's crazy. I don't know if that's good girls. Yeah, but
*  I don't know who's into that but um, the guys are obviously insanely fit
*  So saying that it's not good for you seems silly. It's obviously very good for them
*  Um, you know some of those fucking dudes are so impressive
*  But I just worry about shoulder injuries exactly like the kip ups thingy dingys
*  Uh, what is this called kip kipper is a kip up chin ups and body muscle ups
*  Those things look like a recipe for me to fuck myself up
*  Yeah, they're less recipe for a labrum tear
*  But guys a bunch of guys gave me shit when I set up my own gym their life
*  It looks like a crossfit gym and i'm like, yeah, i'm not doing any kip ups though like making jokes
*  But I do pretty simple looks like a functional
*  Strength gym, you know, I do the most I do you know as far as like
*  I'll do one-armed dumbbell snatches. I do some straight leg deadlifts, but I do everything in moderation
*  Where I used to lift super heavy for power like crazy heavy. We used to be a big motherfucker, right?
*  70 pounds bigger than I am now. Yeah, that's big. Well, I got to I bench my goal was to bench over 500 now I
*  Bring any dickheads emailing me
*  I I cheated right I use steroids and and I didn't know what the fuck I was doing
*  So but I tell you what when your wiener breaks from taking that that'll make you stop doing anything
*  That's what happened. I didn't know the fuck I was doing
*  But I got to where I could lift pretty much anything I wanted. Um, I couldn't
*  Walk from me to jamie and back without getting winded
*  and so
*  Do you like?
*  I mean i'll just
*  Get into list what I took it doesn't matter. Sure. So I was taking um
*  250 milligrams or one millimeter of enanthate every three days
*  So basically i was taking three shots a week of enanthate. I don't know what that is
*  Is that hardcore stuff? No, it's just testosterone 250 milligrams. So I take one shot of that a week now for being on
*  testosterone
*  But I was also taking ecopoies
*  That's for horses. Yes, it is. Um, I was taking ecopoies. I was taking um
*  That makes you super purple. Um
*  Deca
*  I took trennable in for a while, but I could not handle trend dude
*  Fuck I hung a guy out of a building like trend is not good. Um, it's
*  Superhuman strength aggressive sex drive, but superhuman dickhead too. Like it's just not for me
*  So I only took that for a little bit and I didn't take it for that long
*  The one thing I found out is one there's a reason that you're not supposed to be on that shit
*  And i'm not a religious guy
*  So i'm not gonna say god didn't mean you to be that way
*  But somebody didn't mean me to fucking be that way like you're monkeying with your your structure
*  You know you give a chemical and biological and hormonal structure of your body and you're monkeying with that
*  You know, you're adding massive amounts of muscle to your body. You're adding
*  Superhuman levels of hormones to your body. Well, and I you know, i'm i'm an like the first time I took ecopoies
*  It's a horse decongestant. So I took it and I was
*  Yes, it cleans out the airways or opens up to bronchial dilator some hacking shit up like what am I getting sick?
*  Well, it's because I you know, there's horses and pigs on the fucking container, right?
*  Idiot, right?
*  People ask me about it. I'm like don't do it eat healthier
*  you know work out hard like I lost everything anyway, but
*  The problem was is in the middle that they have deca and it's they call it deca dick, right?
*  It makes you like like no sex drive and I wasn't taking anything to um
*  Because I watched hidalgo right and the horse fell in the pit with my daughter and I started crying
*  I don't know. It's a movie right?
*  Anyway horse falls in the pit and the horse gets like a spear in its leg
*  I'm crying. I'm like what the fuck is wrong with me? Well, you're emotional
*  Jesus my uh estrogen levels were like through the roof
*  So I looked and like an idiot I was taking I had
*  200 milligram per milliliter deca and then I had another bottle that was like 400 or something and I got them mixed up
*  So I was doubling up on deca. I guess that some of the dumbers shit is for
*  Maybe a year and a half. Did you get yourself checked out after it was over? Oh, yeah
*  Everything's okay. Well when I first got off, I wish I had a photo
*  I don't feel pulling up how big I guess right dude. I look like that rock on fantastic four. It's fucking weird looking dude
*  I had ronnie colman in here. Oh my god weeks ago. First of all, what a great guy so nice
*  Yeah, like so friendly and so so happy even though he's basically broken. Yeah, he's had how many back surgeries did he say he had?
*  Something crazy
*  Yeah, like more than 10 back surgery written article. It's at 13
*  But I don't know and that was probably it his entire back is basically fused
*  Yeah, but when you look at him when he was mr. Olympia, you know when he was winning, yeah, jesus
*  Yeah, jesus. I mean that a human being can get that big
*  Oh, it's it's insane. And I mean, I only scratched like I didn't put the commando
*  He's done it his whole life right? Those guys are freaks phil heath lives by us in denver
*  You'll see him every now and there you used to and he's a new kind of a one guy like ronnie
*  The thing is though is like you go into a gym and grab two 200 pound dumbbells and you start doing inclined bench with no spotter
*  That stare, you know grabbing some looks but I genetically was not built to lift that heavy, right?
*  That's there's some help involved in that but I got to a point where
*  I was super emotional and not like a
*  I don't believe really in the roid rage thing because I never got that what are you talking about?
*  You're just telling me you're hanging a guy off the side of a building. That's what rage. Yeah, let me finish
*  uh good point, but I think if you just take an increased amount of um,
*  Uh like testosterone and anabolic in general
*  If you're a happy guy, you're happy if you're a sad guy, you're sad and if you're a dickhead you're more of a dickhead
*  the thing with um
*  Well trend that's why I got off it. That was one thing for me that definitely I just
*  I was changing psychologically
*  When I got off it was the problem like
*  Emotionally, I was a wreck like that's the closest i'm not like a suicidal guy
*  That's the closest where my brain just didn't function right and then I got off cold turkey and I whatever
*  That is a big issue with kids young kids
*  Um their endocrine system crashes and just like we were talking about with soldiers that have been blown up a bunch or football players
*  Or fighters
*  Um, your body's not producing testosterone correctly after you get off that shit
*  You get really really depressed for some people bigger exe is what they were telling me because I was afraid to go to the gym
*  Because I was shrinking. Oh right. So, you know what I did is I joined planet fitness
*  Perfect, you can hide in there and be little and fit right in you can even make noise
*  No, I know right kick you out lung alarm. Have you seen that alarm? Have you ever seen an alarm go off?
*  uh, yeah, so
*  Uh, there was a couple muscle heads that went in there
*  I think to prove it in one of the gyms that I went to and they were grunting and deadlifting and drop
*  They kicked them out. They pull your membership. That's so crazy. You can't try hard. I know right if you're lifting heavy you're gonna like
*  If you do that like hey, it was you're trying too hard. We don't want that here
*  It was weird for me. I'm not a weight dropper, but definitely if you're doing a deadlift
*  There's something and it's heavy something's probably gonna come out of you, right? You're gonna you're gonna do some grunting
*  I'm a grunter bro
*  And uh, so like I don't um, i'm not the guy that makes a crazy amount of noise in the gym
*  But there's times where last couple, you know, uh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you're it's frowned upon
*  So I went there for like six months, which I will say was the smartest thing I could have done
*  There was no temptation. There's tootsie rolls in a fucking basket at the front of it, right? There is no really
*  Oh, yeah, they serve tootsie rolls pizza. They serve pizza. Oh, it's the weirdest shit i've ever seen
*  At that place in the space of my life. It was what I needed because I had no temptation
*  I just think it's amazing that they would set up a place where they're encouraging you to not try too hard
*  And they do well
*  It i'm sure I was that's how people like it. I was laughing because well, I'd say laughing like for me
*  Once I got out of it, you know, I was like that is the strangest shit i've ever seen
*  There's a gym that wants you to be fat. That's strange
*  Um because they do there's pizza tuesdays or whatever is it do they want you to be fat or do they just encourage you to not?
*  Intimidate the other people with your performance
*  Is that what it is probably because that was I was definitely the oddball at the one I went to and so
*  Like I would do calf raises and I would put two 45s on each side on the ground
*  And then I would put four 45s on the like a smith machine and i'm just doing calf drops, right?
*  Oh that got shit can immediately. I was like they told you not to do it. Yeah
*  Well one they said I was taking all the weights up and two they said that's not uh, they didn't kick me off
*  Totally. They said that is frowned upon here and I was like what is frowned upon here calf raises
*  Because I how I was doing it
*  Um when I was like, this is strange
*  But I can't again it was good for me at that time to get off because dude
*  That was the hardest thing mentally that I I had that is everything I hate about america
*  Yeah, like that whole just the idea behind that don't try too hard
*  Just like no no, no not here here here. We're gonna use 45 exertion dude. I get in trouble a lot
*  I get called a dick for
*  being the guy that's rub some dirt in your crotch and get the fuck up and go like
*  Not rub some dirt on your crotch. Is that real good advice? Yeah
*  It gets a point across right? I like well when guys will ask me
*  uh certain pieces of advice that they need like a
*  they need someone like maybe you or me or renella or whoever to give them a
*  Oh, man, that's okay
*  I'm not that fucking guy. Don't send me a message where you think you're going to get some kind of um, you know
*  Oh, it's okay that you suck
*  You know keep going like I try to circle myself with people that tell me I suck to try harder that makes sense
*  Yeah, and I get messages and i'm like dude
*  No, that's not okay. I'm like you're you're fucking weak. Just push harder. That's that's the key keep trying
*  Well, the only problem with that kind of advice is some people start off with a terrible base, right?
*  If you're a if you're a person that doesn't have any athletic background no exercise at all
*  You really do have to start off light and I tell people all the time
*  Like if you're just starting exercise say if you work in an office, you're in a cubicle. You're completely sedentary
*  All you have to do is just start walking just start with walks then start with do some push-ups do do a few things
*  Don't do anything crazy. That's great build up. That's what the advice i'm giving though
*  Is that type of advice like when they're they send me their diet plan and it's the diet plan of a greek god
*  And i'm like
*  Yeah, you're fucking lying like you're not doing that shit like that's what i'm talking about
*  I totally agree with what you're saying
*  But think about it if I message you and said hey man, i've been eating 80 grams of carbs a day
*  I'm walking four miles. No soda. I'm still 260 pounds at 5 9
*  I think something's wrong and it's like yeah, you're fucking lying to yourself is what's wrong or maybe something's really wrong
*  You need to go to a doctor. I've said that too
*  because you I have
*  I've met a lot of people with um
*  Thyroid problems, yeah, definitely that but you can get checked out
*  And so I am probably not the best for advice because literally if you're the guy that's gotten checked out and you're just making excuses
*  I'm like dude, just quit fucking lying to yourself and push more
*  It is kind of crazy how many people lie about how often they work out and what they do. Yeah, it's really sad
*  Yeah, well and again, I probably sound jaded but coming as a recovering fat kid myself, right?
*  Like fuck I wake up and eat peanut but my wife has to hide the shit, right?
*  I got problems so I know where they're coming from you say that but i've never seen you fat
*  Um years i've known you you've always been fit, but I always say i'm fat so I don't get that way exactly
*  That's what that's the mentality
*  That's the right mentality versus the mentality that lies about how often you work out and what you eat. Well and and and you know
*  Again, I call myself fat and I always will because I never want to be fat again when I get I got up to
*  260 when I got out of the army
*  Did you ever get to a point where you were making your own meals for the backcountry like did you ever use a dehydrator?
*  I do that now do you do that now? Yeah, what do you cook? Like what kind of stuff do you make? So um
*  Rewind the cheapest meal I can get if i'm in a hurry
*  And I can't make it as I get brown rice top ramen and olive oil tuna for people listening
*  That is a cheap way to do it. But so tuna and olive oil
*  Brown brown rice top ramen. Yep. What is brown rice? Top? It's just a healthier top ramen. Yeah
*  Yep, and then I make my own seasoning so it's not loaded with sodium
*  um, but when I make a meal and there's multiple ways to do that the like super easiest is just take um
*  Elk steak right or elk. Um a roast cooked a roast like you normally would
*  And then in that roast i'll cut up sweet potatoes and i'll put in veggies in there
*  Just basically make kind of a stew
*  And then in that then I and I put up so when I do that though
*  I put a ton of olive oil in it because of the fat
*  And then I have trays on the dehydrator and they're the the trays where it's like a frisbee so it can't go through
*  So i've got elk sweet potatoes olive oil. I'll usually put in like broccoli shit like that and the sweet potatoes
*  I cut up relatively small
*  I dehydrated that it's that simple
*  Do you have to when you make a meal like that with a dehydrated?
*  Do you have to add extra seasoning so that it tastes good when you rehydrate it?
*  There's two ways to do it
*  What I encourage people to do is not add as much seasoning when you cook it because it will be hard to get it
*  right meaning
*  Everyone might if you're if you got a buddy or or depending upon what the meal is
*  Some meals are more flavorful than others. Some are more bland. I add it after
*  Oh, okay
*  So when you're in it's like you pour boiling water into it and then you add the seasoning on top of that
*  So what I do is I?
*  Depending you can do it in a ziploc bag, but the easiest thing is those just cheap plastic
*  Containers or you can put in a titanium when it doesn't matter
*  But once I you know kick it off boil it get it rehydrated get the boiling water in there
*  I just put a lid on it
*  Let it sit for 10 minutes not very long or boil it until it is if I have extra fuel
*  And then it's ready to go just like that. Just like a mountain house the same principle dude
*  Nothing makes me fart harder than mountain houses. Yeah, and it turns your poop funny colors
*  Like mres is an orange and a mountain house is a green. Um, i've never pooped green
*  At least I did and I did look at it
*  But the smells that were coming out of my body the last time I ate mountain houses was like christ
*  The shit cannot be good for you. It's got a lot of sodium and most people are like why does it matter?
*  It's like 150 nights a year. It fucking matters. Like I have got to I can't eat those things all the time. So
*  Um, there's a few new companies off-grid. It's pretty healthy that I use
*  But when I make my own like I will take idaho and potatoes and then at home
*  I make for shepard's pie and then what i've made and put in the dehydrator
*  I just mix it with idaho and potato so I make my own shepard's pie
*  So you dehydrate it and then do you vacuum seal it in little packets? It depends if i'm
*  A lot of times no, I actually just put it in a ziploc bag because the vacuum seal thing
*  It helps but if i'm making it per trip or per month, you know, you're not trying to get it to stay forever
*  Yeah, i'm yeah, i'm not worried about it. So yeah, that's one of the things but there's other ways to cheat
*  You know, I say cheat the system, but there is other ways that you can
*  Save money eat healthier, you know when you're out there and a lot of guys if you're only going for seven days
*  It's not that big of a deal but long term, you know, you really gotta think ahead
*  I would also imagine that it gives you an extra sense of satisfaction that you're doing something like you're creating your own meals
*  And yeah, and while you're eating that, you know, this is a meal that from an animal that you shot yourself
*  You put the meal together yourself you dehydrate it
*  Now you're rehydrating it that extra sense of satisfaction that you're doing something
*  it is and
*  Actually, i've done it so much now that satisfaction is almost kind of deep again desensitized. We're talking 20 years
*  It's normal. It's it's normal. What's weird?
*  What's not normal is when people look at me like i'm weird that I do it. That is weird for me like i'm like
*  What it's not i'm like you cook burger. Don't you like really people come over?
*  And well, my wife's a real estate agent. She gives a package to to the people that want a wild game
*  Dude, it's like the smartest thing she ever thought of because I don't you know what I've never bought elk
*  But I guess it's fucking expensive if you go buy it. Yeah
*  Yeah, so she'll do like a package wild game as a thank you if she sells the house
*  They'll call and she has all kinds of recipes or whatever
*  So when people come over and they're like, what are we eating and i'm like, oh that's mountain goat
*  And uh, that's moose there and then we we have like jalapeno cheeseburger and we'll mix it with our dad
*  Because our dad's kind of a weird flavor. What is our dad tastes like because everybody is
*  Varied on that some people say it's terrible. Some people say it's delicious. I would say the taste is good. It's tough
*  It's tough chewy. So it's good like like a braise it and cook it slow cook it
*  So I don't think you can fuck up anything. You slow cook. That's the thing when people are i'm like, how do you fuck up a roast?
*  Just all right
*  But if you like I took a backstrap or a tenderloin and cooked it it was pretty tough
*  So we make everything into burger salami, you know pepperoni sticks or whatever out of the out dad now
*  Is it my first choice now, but I tell you the burger is pretty flavorful
*  So we make almost everything out of into breakfast sausage and burger
*  Does it depend on what time of year like if it's in the rut?
*  I would say the rut part has a huge part to do with it
*  But if you make it into jalapeno cheeseburger, I give a fuck if you put that into a turd
*  That is going to taste good, right? It doesn't matter. And so
*  The last one that big big one I shot we made almost that whole thing into well we did we made the whole thing into burger
*  Brats breakfast sausage, but it tastes pretty good. It's not bad. I mean
*  I think how people take care of the animal is part of the problem and how they cook it
*  Yeah, so we let let them we we drip them, you know
*  We drain them totally and we'll when I say age it not aging
*  We'll let it hang for a couple days. We let it age as far as let it drain out. It makes it more tender
*  so
*  I
*  Hate when people see say things taste bad when it's just you're a dumb shit bad preparation
*  Yeah, it's brad prep because I haven't tasted much wild game. That wasn't great, dude
*  We just did three hours believe it or not. Good god
*  Time flies in this room. I know i'm peed yet and that's a fucking miracle. I know you drank two kill clips
*  And a bottle of water. Yeah
*  Listen man, tell everybody your podcast kefaro cast you can get if you're interested more in hunting and backpacking
