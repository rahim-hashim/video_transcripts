*  Yeah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=16.0s)]
*  It's weird here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=17.0s)]
*  Yeah, because LA, it's like famous people are everywhere. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=18.0s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=20.0s)]
*  They know how to act. People know how to act. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=21.0s)]
*  Here it's just starting a little bit. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=22.0s)]
*  It's just like Matthew McConaughey, Elon, but Elon never goes anywhere. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=23.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=28.0s)]
*  He's working on five different companies. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=29.0s)]
*  Right. Who else? Who else is in Austin? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=31.0s)]
*  Zach Levy, but he lives out a little bit further out in the country. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=33.0s)]
*  Yeah, just McConaughey. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=39.0s)]
*  Dawson moved here, James Vanderbeek. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=40.0s)]
*  Oh, that's right. He's here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=42.0s)]
*  And then the other, there's a few guys. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=44.0s)]
*  Well, it's also I think podcast famous. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=47.0s)]
*  Sandra Bullock, but she's never here either. She's always working. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=49.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I think podcast fame and internet fame, it's like people, you're much more approachable too. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=51.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=55.0s)]
*  You know, because it's like you're in their ears. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=56.0s)]
*  Well, they 100% know you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=58.0s)]
*  100% know you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=59.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=60.0s)]
*  They know all the most embarrassing stories you told seven years ago when you were like, podcasting isn't going to catch on. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=61.0s)]
*  And you talked about, you know, things you put in your ass in middle school. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=66.0s)]
*  They're like, oh. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=69.0s)]
*  Bro, 12 years ago for me. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=70.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=72.0s)]
*  Yeah, we started off with a fucking laptop using a webcam. High as fuck. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=73.0s)]
*  Just recording directly to the webcam, like the laptop audio. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=78.0s)]
*  Yes. Well, we had like some sort of a USB microphone. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=82.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=85.0s)]
*  But we also did like everything completely obliterated. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=86.0s)]
*  We were doing volcano hits. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=90.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, the volcano. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=93.0s)]
*  That's a beautiful thing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=95.0s)]
*  You didn't know what you were saying and why you were saying it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=96.0s)]
*  Like while you were saying it, you're like, what am I saying? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=98.0s)]
*  Of course. Well, no one's going to listen. Who gives a fuck? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=100.0s)]
*  I'm just having fun. And then they did. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=102.0s)]
*  Back then it was like, you know, a good episode would have like 2000 people. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=104.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=108.0s)]
*  For real. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=109.0s)]
*  Now a tweet that gets 2000, I'm like bombed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=110.0s)]
*  I know. What happened? What wrong? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=112.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking fascinating to see the difference in tweets now [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=114.0s)]
*  because people aren't scared to post what they really think about something. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=119.0s)]
*  So like NBC News will post something and then underneath it, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=124.0s)]
*  you'll just see a cascade of people shitting all over them. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=127.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=130.0s)]
*  And harshly. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=131.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=132.0s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=133.0s)]
*  You're making death threats. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=134.0s)]
*  No, not that. They're not. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=135.0s)]
*  They're like, fuck you, Tucker. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=136.0s)]
*  But they can be funny again and not worry about getting banned or shadow banned or any of that stuff. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=138.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=143.0s)]
*  No, I barely, I honestly barely use Twitter anymore. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=144.0s)]
*  It's just like. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=147.0s)]
*  Me too. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=148.0s)]
*  Purely for all social media, honestly, I just do the fucking, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=149.0s)]
*  because it's comedy and you have to get people out to stuff. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=152.0s)]
*  Right, promotion. Yeah. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=154.0s)]
*  I really don't think people should use that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=155.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm not breaking any ground here, but it's like I barely, you know. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=157.0s)]
*  You and I are on the same page. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=161.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. Dude, I put my phone away for like this summer. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=162.0s)]
*  I went back to Baltimore. I lost like 20 pounds to my brother. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=165.0s)]
*  My brother's a trainer and I just didn't use my phone. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=168.0s)]
*  I was fucking eating right. I was working out every day. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=171.0s)]
*  Fuck it. I felt great. I was like, this is awesome. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=174.0s)]
*  I'm going to go into the next leg of the tour. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=176.0s)]
*  I'm in New York for like four days and I'm like, I'm just going to check Instagram to try and get pussy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=178.0s)]
*  And I haven't been off it for more than 20 minutes for four months. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=182.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=187.0s)]
*  And I was like, I know you know what you have to do. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=188.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's like, you know, you can't stop. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=190.0s)]
*  Well, and then the fucking algorithm gets you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=193.0s)]
*  The tick tock algorithm. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=196.0s)]
*  I don't fuck with tick tock, but apparently that's the worst. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=197.0s)]
*  I was just going to say that I was listening to Chris Williamson. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=200.0s)]
*  Do you know him? He's another guy who's out here in Austin. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=202.0s)]
*  Great. Really interesting, intelligent guy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=205.0s)]
*  He runs a great podcast, but he had Scott Galloway on and they were talking about how tick tock is essentially engineered to like keep us engaged and also accentuate all of our disagreements and arguments and make America look like a real shit hole. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=208.0s)]
*  I didn't even think about the disagreements. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=224.0s)]
*  Because my feed is like they've completely got me. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=226.0s)]
*  It's like fucking just a nice sandwich. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=229.0s)]

*  True. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=701.0s)]
*  They're probably a very small minority. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=702.0s)]
*  I've done the research. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=704.0s)]
*  It's not that many. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=705.0s)]
*  I have jacked off to a couple of these videos. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=706.0s)]
*  I don't think that's a genre yet. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=708.0s)]
*  No, but we'll get there. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=710.0s)]
*  You have to like get people to train for it, like Cirque du Soleil. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=711.0s)]
*  You know, get these gals going, look, there's a whole new genre. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=715.0s)]
*  Like if porn was organized the way like film and television was. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=719.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=722.0s)]

*  How big is that dude? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=729.0s)]
*  He's a little guy. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=730.0s)]
*  But bro, she looks like she's got some fucking stock genetics. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=731.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=736.0s)]
*  Like that will make you a barbarian. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=737.0s)]
*  I mean, that guy's foot could fit in her pussy. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=738.0s)]
*  Look at the size of her fucking legs and her ass muscles. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=742.0s)]
*  The way she's hoisting that guy one arm over her head. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=746.0s)]
*  Let's just assume he's a tiny guy. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=749.0s)]
*  Tiny guy. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=751.0s)]
*  He's got to weigh 100 pounds. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=752.0s)]
*  Let's say 5'2", 100 pounds. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=753.0s)]
*  Even if he's doing 100 pounds over your head with one arm like that, it's crazy. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=754.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=759.0s)]
*  And the fact that it's this woman who's very womanly. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=760.0s)]
*  When is this from? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=762.0s)]
*  19th century muscle women. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=763.0s)]

*  Oh, you got two little guys. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=773.0s)]
*  Two little guys with one arm over her head. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=774.0s)]
*  And that's the thing, no one could... [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=777.0s)]
*  You weren't allowed to jack off to stuff plainly. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=779.0s)]
*  This couldn't be a sex thing, but this was 100% a sex thing back then. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=782.0s)]
*  Look at the size of her and she's holding three guys on her arms. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=785.0s)]
*  What did she do? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=789.0s)]
*  This seems like the same lady. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=790.0s)]
*  This is a genre. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=791.0s)]
*  She's lost a history. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=792.0s)]
*  No offense to this long since past woman, but she has a very masculine face. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=794.0s)]
*  She does. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=798.0s)]

*  I'm going to say 5'11". [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=906.0s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=909.0s)]
*  597 feet. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=911.0s)]
*  Does she count as six foot? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=912.0s)]
*  Six foot? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=913.0s)]
*  Oh, she's six foot. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=914.0s)]
*  Oh, she's six foot. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=915.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=916.0s)]
*  It's a big lady. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=917.0s)]
*  Big lady. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=918.0s)]
*  Big stout lady. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=919.0s)]
*  So the running back, I'm blanking on his name, but literally the trainer, he was like, hey, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=920.0s)]
*  should I lift weights like the defensive lineman? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=925.0s)]
*  And they were like, no, that'll slow you down. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=928.0s)]
*  Like they literally had no, this is in the 70s, the NFL. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=931.0s)]
*  That was with boxing too. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=935.0s)]
*  It's crazy, dude. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=936.0s)]
*  In the boxing era of like Marvin Hagler and Sugar Ray Leonard, it was commonly thought [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=937.0s)]
*  that if you lifted weights, it would slow you down. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=944.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=947.0s)]
*  It would ruin your punching power. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=948.0s)]
*  Like they would only do calisthenics. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=950.0s)]
*  Marvin Hagler did just sit ups and push ups and stuff like that. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=952.0s)]
*  You'd have to be a freak of nature to make it, which is even more impressive. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=955.0s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=958.0s)]
*  You don't think so? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=959.0s)]
*  No, because there's a lot of exercise. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=960.0s)]
*  There's a lot of thought to just getting very efficient at the technique when it comes to [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=963.0s)]
*  fighting. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=969.0s)]
*  There's some people believe in strength and conditioning as the primary. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=970.0s)]
*  They think that that's more important than anything. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=973.0s)]
*  There's a school of thought like the Marv Marinovich school of thought, which was you [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=975.0s)]
*  already know how to fight, so get in insane shape. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=980.0s)]
*  And so he had guys doing these crazy plyometrics and all those different jumping boxes and [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=983.0s)]
*  stuff. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=989.0s)]
*  And they got, you know who BJ Penn is? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=990.0s)]
*  BJ Penn? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=992.0s)]
*  BJ Penn. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=993.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=994.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=995.0s)]
*  One of the greatest fighters of all time. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=996.0s)]
*  And BJ's in his prime. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=997.0s)]
*  BJ was training with the Marinovich's. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=998.0s)]
*  So he was just doing these unbelievably brutal cardio workouts every day and almost no martial [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1000.0s)]
*  arts. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1007.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1008.0s)]
*  And then he would go and have a gas tank that was off the charts. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1009.0s)]
*  When you got a guy who's R&D is talented as BJ with zero fear of getting tired, he was [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1011.0s)]
*  the goat. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1016.0s)]
*  There was a fighter that I'd ever want to see. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1017.0s)]
*  It'd be Khabib Nurmagomedov in his prime versus BJ Penn in those years in the Marinovich's. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1020.0s)]
*  BJ Penn was a motherfucker man. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1026.0s)]
*  He was a motherfucker. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1029.0s)]
*  Woo! [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1032.0s)]
*  I did have an era actually, my little brothers were much more into UFC shit, but the Penn [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1033.0s)]
*  era, I was in there a little bit. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1037.0s)]
*  We'd go to Buffalo Wild Wings at White Marsh Mall, me and my brothers, and we would watch [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1039.0s)]
*  UFC shit. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1044.0s)]
*  But that's my last frame of reference. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1045.0s)]
*  I don't catch up with it. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1050.0s)]
*  I'm not with it as much anymore. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1051.0s)]
*  BJ Penn was so unusual that he won the 155 pound title, he won the 170 pound title, and [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1053.0s)]
*  he fought heavyweight. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1060.0s)]
*  He fought Lyoto Machida as a heavyweight. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1062.0s)]
*  That is fucking insane. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1065.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1067.0s)]
*  Off the plyometrics. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1068.0s)]
*  Gangster. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1069.0s)]
*  He's just gangster. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1070.0s)]
*  He fought, when he fought Lyoto, he wasn't even doing that stuff. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1071.0s)]
*  That was pre-prime BJ. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1075.0s)]
*  That was when he would just fucking train. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1077.0s)]
*  And he just ate. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1079.0s)]
*  He's like, fuck it, I'll fight anybody. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1080.0s)]
*  Lyoto Machida was like a UFC light heavyweight champion at one point in time. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1082.0s)]
*  This was before the UFC, but Lyoto was still a bad motherfucker. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1086.0s)]
*  BJ fought him at heavyweight. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1090.0s)]
*  I do love that. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1092.0s)]
*  It's bonkers. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1093.0s)]
*  I love when a guy towards the end just kind of gets a little fat, doesn't give a fuck. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1094.0s)]
*  That's the coolest. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1097.0s)]
*  That makes me sad. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1098.0s)]
*  I love it, dude. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1099.0s)]
*  That makes me sad. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1100.0s)]
*  Tony Gwynn, fat as shit, still fucking never striking out. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1101.0s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1104.0s)]
*  That's different. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1105.0s)]
*  Baseball is different. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1106.0s)]
*  I guess you're right than combat sports. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1107.0s)]
*  Yeah, combat sports, when guys don't want to do it anymore, they gotta stop. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1108.0s)]
*  Because there's like a one foot in, one foot out thing that happens. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1111.0s)]
*  And you just get your shit rocked. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1114.0s)]
*  And then some young guy comes up, or young gal comes up, and he or she fucks you up. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1115.0s)]
*  And that's just how it goes. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1120.0s)]
*  These kids that are coming up, they are fucking unburdened by life. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1121.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1126.0s)]
*  They've only been alive for 22 years. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1128.0s)]
*  Fully, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1130.0s)]
*  They have fucking unbelievable bodies that recover quickly. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1131.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1135.0s)]
*  And if they train well, and also they grow up learning it on television. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1136.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1139.0s)]
*  And watching it on YouTube. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1140.0s)]
*  They're seeing martial arts from the time they're little kids. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1141.0s)]
*  So like all these techniques, so like they're practicing when they're fucking around with their friends. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1143.0s)]
*  And there's nothing cooler than dethroning a legend either. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1147.0s)]
*  Nothing cool. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1150.0s)]
*  So they're coming at you with everything. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1151.0s)]
*  Yeah, everybody wants to be Mike Tyson. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1152.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1154.0s)]
*  You know, Mike Tyson was 20 years old, he wins the heavyweight championship. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1155.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1158.0s)]
*  And everybody's like, whoa, what the fuck. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1159.0s)]
*  Fully. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1161.0s)]
*  No one wants to be Mike Tyson getting knocked out. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1162.0s)]
*  No one wants to be Tyson when he retired. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1164.0s)]
*  I think it was 90. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1167.0s)]
*  It was February 11th, 1990, because it was a year after I was born. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1168.0s)]
*  Or it was when he... [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1172.0s)]
*  When he lost to Buster Douglas? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1175.0s)]
*  Yes, the Buster Douglas fight. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1176.0s)]
*  But even after the Buster Douglas fight, he was still Mike Tyson. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1177.0s)]
*  People were still terrified of him. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1180.0s)]
*  He was just like a little resting on his laurels, you know. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1181.0s)]
*  Fucking the maid. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1185.0s)]
*  That's the best story of my time. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1186.0s)]
*  He was out of control. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1187.0s)]
*  I mean, he'll tell you what he was doing. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1188.0s)]
*  He was out of fucking control. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1190.0s)]
*  You know, he fought on drugs. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1192.0s)]
*  He fought sick. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1194.0s)]
*  He was sick. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1196.0s)]
*  Like he had... [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1197.0s)]
*  When he knocked out Michael Spinks, he had some sort of venereal disease. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1198.0s)]
*  No bullshit. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1202.0s)]
*  Dude, Mike Tyson in that era... [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1203.0s)]
*  Dick leaking. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1206.0s)]
*  He's just fucking throwing haymakers. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1207.0s)]
*  You got to think, like part of the reason why he was so good was because he was so wild. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1209.0s)]
*  But also, if he wasn't, if he just maximized his insane potential and was like a Marvin [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1214.0s)]
*  Hagler type guy who just did nothing but train and trained in solitude and yet only [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1222.0s)]
*  had his eyes on the prize, only had his eyes on beating the best in the world. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1230.0s)]
*  I just don't think. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1233.0s)]
*  Some guys are wired. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1234.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1235.0s)]
*  And you lose that essence. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1236.0s)]
*  I think fully, it's like... [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1238.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1240.0s)]
*  He's one of the... [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1241.0s)]
*  I know what you mean. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1242.0s)]
*  It's nice to think about it as like a video game and it's like just run him through a [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1243.0s)]
*  curve. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1245.0s)]
*  He's your creative character. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1246.0s)]
*  And it's like, but the same guy who had that kind of power, he needed to fucking ask the [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1247.0s)]
*  housekeeper to suck him off. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1253.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1254.0s)]
*  Like when they kept... [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1255.0s)]
*  That's my favorite story about when they were like, you can't go out, Mike. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1256.0s)]
*  You got it. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1258.0s)]
*  And he just fucked the maids. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1259.0s)]
*  And it was just like, that's who he fucking was. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1260.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, that's the guy who's going to fight with gonorrhea. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1263.0s)]
*  And he's still going to knock you out. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1267.0s)]
*  Yeah, in one round. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1269.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1270.0s)]
*  Locks out Michael Spinks, who's all time great light heavyweight. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1271.0s)]
*  Fully. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1274.0s)]
*  Who had just beat Larry Holmes. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1275.0s)]
*  Yeah, Tyson and his brother. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1276.0s)]
*  That's what everybody wants to be. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1277.0s)]
*  You want to be that young upsurging phenom. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1278.0s)]
*  Like BJ was when BJ was in his youth too. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1281.0s)]
*  The same kind of thing when he was coming through the ranks. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1284.0s)]
*  He was this young upstart. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1286.0s)]
*  But nothing for you. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1288.0s)]
*  I mean, that's what you want because that zenith is so high, like that moment when you're fucking [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1289.0s)]
*  taking it. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1294.0s)]
*  But it's like, I don't know, man. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1295.0s)]
*  Wouldn't you rather just have the... [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1297.0s)]
*  What would you rather the glory, the like, you know, and then the fall or would you want [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1298.0s)]
*  to just get the glory and maintain is probably the best thing, right? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1303.0s)]
*  That's what you want to be. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1306.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1307.0s)]
*  But if you had to choose one or the other, I'm really into the... [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1308.0s)]
*  I'm reading the Iliad. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1310.0s)]
*  I'm really into the Trojan Wars shit right now. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1313.0s)]
*  And it's like Achilles had that thing where they were like, you have two options. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1315.0s)]
*  You can be a short life, but you're the most fucking, fucking big dick warrior of all time. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1318.0s)]
*  Everyone will be scared of you. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1324.0s)]
*  You'll go down in the history books forever or a long life. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1325.0s)]
*  No one's ever heard of you. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1328.0s)]
*  You're happy. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1329.0s)]
*  You have kids. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1330.0s)]
*  And he obviously chooses that. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1331.0s)]
*  He chooses like, fuck yeah, dude. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1333.0s)]
*  Let's go fuck some shit up. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1334.0s)]
*  And then he's the fucking man. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1336.0s)]
*  He's so cool. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1338.0s)]
*  But then in the Odyssey, Odysseus has to go to like Hades and he finds Achilles and he's [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1339.0s)]
*  like, I fucked up, dude. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1345.0s)]
*  This fucking sucks. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1346.0s)]
*  I hate being dead. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1347.0s)]
*  I wish I was fucking a grandfather. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1348.0s)]
*  I wish I was back in the village. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1350.0s)]
*  And it's just like, you want that thing, but you never... [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1351.0s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1354.0s)]
*  Sometimes you just think like, I'm thinking about that now with comedy where it's like, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1355.0s)]
*  fuck, dude, this is cool. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1358.0s)]
*  I'm getting the fucking, you know, my special went well. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1360.0s)]
*  I'm getting to sell some tickets, but I'm on the road constantly. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1362.0s)]
*  It's what I dreamed of when I was 19. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1364.0s)]
*  And I'm like, damn, I'm just gonna... [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1367.0s)]
*  It's a lot of work. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1368.0s)]
*  It's a lot of work. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1369.0s)]
*  I'm getting fat as shit. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1370.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm fucking... [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1371.0s)]
*  It's hard to stay healthy. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1372.0s)]
*  I'm tired all the time. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1373.0s)]
*  Which again, I'm not complaining. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1374.0s)]
*  This is my dream. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1376.0s)]
*  But it's like, there's got to be a balance between like fucking selling out everything [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1377.0s)]
*  to get the thing. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1381.0s)]
*  Because then something's... [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1382.0s)]
*  Shit comes after that. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1383.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1384.0s)]
*  And there's so many stories of people that get what they want. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1385.0s)]
*  And I mean, Tyson is a pretty good example where it's like, it wasn't... [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1388.0s)]
*  He was still Mike Tyson, but he never reached those heights. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1392.0s)]
*  And it completely fucked his personal life up, obviously. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1395.0s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1398.0s)]
*  And so that's the thing where it's like, you got to think, there's got to be a balance. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1399.0s)]
*  The thing about combat sports though that is really fascinating to me is I think it [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1402.0s)]
*  ignites in us that same weird instinct to conquer, but it does so in an agreed upon manner [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1406.0s)]
*  instead of doing so through war. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1415.0s)]
*  It's like a great way to avoid war. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1417.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1419.0s)]
*  Because how many of these guys who would be dominant MMA fighters, they were living five, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1420.0s)]
*  six hundred years ago, they would be dominant warriors. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1424.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1426.0s)]
*  Almost all of them. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1427.0s)]
*  Like society has figured out a way through things like football, which was initially [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1428.0s)]
*  created for that. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1431.0s)]
*  Like football was literally created as a sport to sort of simulate... [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1432.0s)]
*  Blow off some steam. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1436.0s)]
*  Wasn't it? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1437.0s)]
*  Didn't we go over that before? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1438.0s)]
*  Like ground war? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1439.0s)]
*  That football was created, was invented to sort of simulate war. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1440.0s)]
*  I mean, couldn't you say that about... [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1444.0s)]
*  Let's find that with the article because I don't want to fuck that up. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1445.0s)]
*  Because it's an interesting story about the origins of football. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1448.0s)]
*  But there's a thing when you watch a guy win a world title fight. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1451.0s)]
*  There's a thing when you watch two of the best in world fight where everyone gets to [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1456.0s)]
*  watch and these guys who are the wildest and craziest of our population get to do this [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1461.0s)]
*  thing, which is akin to combat. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1468.0s)]
*  Fully. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1471.0s)]
*  It's like physical combat with no weapons, but your own body. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1472.0s)]
*  Use that as a weapon and then see who knows how to do that better and you do it in front [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1476.0s)]
*  of the world. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1481.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that is the ancient shit of single combat, right? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1482.0s)]
*  Where it's like each culture... [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1485.0s)]
*  Or if you wanted to avoid a war, we pick our best guy and we fuck each other up. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1487.0s)]
*  And there is a feeling of that, definitely, especially when it's clashes of cultures, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1491.0s)]
*  right? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1497.0s)]
*  When it is like Khabib and it is fucking Connor or whatever. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1498.0s)]
*  It's like these guys from completely different places and it almost feels like... [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1501.0s)]
*  Like that's what's cool about the World Cup. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1505.0s)]
*  Obviously, it's not combat sports, but there is something sick where you're just like, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1507.0s)]
*  these countries, this means so much to them. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1511.0s)]
*  So much to them. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1513.0s)]
*  And these people, they got eliminated, but Japan and Korea, if they had won, they would [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1514.0s)]
*  have played each other in the fucking World Cup. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1518.0s)]
*  And it's like... [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1520.0s)]
*  Korea would have fucked Japan. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1521.0s)]
*  They're so mad. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1523.0s)]
*  I mean, that's their oppressor. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1525.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1526.0s)]
*  Like Japan fucked Korea up. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1527.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1528.0s)]
*  Like those ancient rivalries, like England and France fought each other for thousands [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1529.0s)]
*  of years. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1533.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1534.0s)]
*  It's like there is... [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1535.0s)]
*  It's just so... [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1536.0s)]
*  There is something fucking awesome about... [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1537.0s)]
*  And whenever a third world country plays America, you don't think they want to fuck America up? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1539.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1543.0s)]
*  And be like, fuck you. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1544.0s)]
*  You got all the money in the world. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1545.0s)]
*  We don't give a fuck. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1546.0s)]
*  We know you put our dictator in power. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1547.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1548.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1549.0s)]
*  Do we know your orchestrated cool? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1550.0s)]
*  Come on, dude. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1552.0s)]
*  My uncle was the democratically elected guy's fucking minister of the press. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1553.0s)]
*  He got assassinated too. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1558.0s)]
*  You got to go, motherfucker. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1559.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1560.0s)]
*  This is for the CIA. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1561.0s)]
*  This goal is for the CIA. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1562.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1563.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's like war proxy. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1564.0s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1565.0s)]
*  What was that article? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1566.0s)]
*  You highlighted something? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1567.0s)]
*  No, it's a tradition of it. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1568.0s)]
*  I don't know that it was like an official mandator. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1569.0s)]
*  It says, a deeper connection was claimed during both world wars, football as a training ground [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1574.0s)]
*  for soldiers and officers, the game as a mimic war, requiring cool thinking, self sacrifice, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1579.0s)]
*  and physical courage. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1585.0s)]
*  So at least in some ways, obviously from that, it's like a proxy. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1586.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1590.0s)]
*  It's like a thing that you can do. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1591.0s)]
*  You can do that instead of war, or maybe it can help you practice for war. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1592.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1595.0s)]
*  But that's- [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1596.0s)]
*  Especially back then when they really, world wars could pop off at any time. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1597.0s)]
*  At any time. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1601.0s)]
*  Maybe you can't, you know. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1602.0s)]
*  That's the thing with combat sports too. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1603.0s)]
*  It's all of it is, it's the same thing. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1605.0s)]
*  It's just a way, there's a thing that people have inside of them, they want to conquer. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1608.0s)]
*  And women want to do it too. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1613.0s)]
*  They want to do it socially. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1614.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1615.0s)]
*  You know, and it's, and some women physically, the ones that you want to fuck. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1616.0s)]
*  Yeah, conquer me. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1621.0s)]
*  It's a weird thing that we have in us, and it makes you wonder, if people hadn't figured [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1624.0s)]
*  out sports, and hadn't figured out games, how much would we be fucking each other up? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1629.0s)]
*  It seems like that's what people are designed to do, and all these other things that we [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1634.0s)]
*  do that all the other animals don't do are probably the thing that has allowed us to [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1637.0s)]
*  become what we are. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1641.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1642.0s)]
*  It's probably the things that have allowed us to figure out civilization. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1643.0s)]
*  You blow off a little steam. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1645.0s)]
*  We've figured out ways to get along. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1646.0s)]
*  Like, let's play with a ball. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1648.0s)]
*  I'm going to hit this ball instead of your fucking head. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1650.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1653.0s)]
*  I'm not going to sneak in. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1654.0s)]
*  Think about it, a weapon, a bat is a fucking club. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1655.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1657.0s)]
*  It's a total weapon. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1658.0s)]
*  Instead of your fucking head, which I want to hit, let's use coconuts. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1659.0s)]
*  I'm going to pretend it's the coconut. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1662.0s)]
*  I'm going to pretend you're fucking nuts with this coconut. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1664.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1666.0s)]
*  And they said back to them, there was this, now, I think we researched this too, but god [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1667.0s)]
*  damn, that marijuana is ruining my memory. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1671.0s)]
*  Respect, by the way. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1673.0s)]
*  This is such a great racket. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1675.0s)]
*  About. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1677.0s)]
*  Just get the guy's shit and be like, what is that fucking meme I saw? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1678.0s)]
*  Was that an article? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1681.0s)]
*  In the Mayan, that Mayan football game, they used to have a football game. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1682.0s)]
*  Which was like football and a little like lacrosse. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1686.0s)]
*  It was kind of a little mix. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1689.0s)]
*  Yeah, you had to knock it through a hole. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1690.0s)]
*  And there was also talk that sometimes they used a human head. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1692.0s)]
*  But I don't know if that was folklore or true. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1695.0s)]
*  And then there was another thing that I read that I never could remember if this is accurate, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1699.0s)]
*  that the winning team would be sacrificed. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1703.0s)]
*  Whoa, that's fucking sick. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1706.0s)]
*  Go to the gods and win our sacrifice. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1708.0s)]
*  It'll be a long ass game where people keep missing the ball. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1710.0s)]
*  Whoops. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1713.0s)]
*  What is it, Jamie? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1714.0s)]
*  This article about it says, for instance, did the game's winners and losers get sacrificed [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1715.0s)]
*  at the end of the game? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1718.0s)]
*  The answer to both questions is no. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1719.0s)]
*  No, so it's all bullshit. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1721.0s)]
*  Players are likely not sacrificed. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1722.0s)]
*  But what if they were? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1723.0s)]
*  And the ball was meant. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1724.0s)]
*  That'd be cool. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1725.0s)]
*  Wasn't meant to go through the hoop. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1726.0s)]
*  Dude, it wasn't? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1727.0s)]
*  What is the hoop for? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1728.0s)]
*  But that game was really violent. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1729.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1731.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1732.0s)]
*  There's like a hoop, right? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1733.0s)]
*  It's not really likely to happen from time to time. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1734.0s)]
*  This is sick, dude. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1735.0s)]
*  That's not what it was for. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1736.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1737.0s)]
*  It happened from time to time. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1738.0s)]
*  So it was like extra points? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1739.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like Harry Potter. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1740.0s)]
*  It's just like you would've been horrible. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1741.0s)]
*  It's all about catching the little gold thing. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1742.0s)]
*  It would've been horrible if your best players were sacrificed. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1744.0s)]
*  So they would have to find new players all the time. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1747.0s)]
*  Well, maybe they just did that because they have too many dudes that want to go to war. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1749.0s)]
*  And there wasn't any wars going on. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1753.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1755.0s)]
*  Listen, we've got to kill off some of these fuckheads. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1756.0s)]
*  I know what to do. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1758.0s)]
*  I also think every ancient tradition is just some insecure guy was in power. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1759.0s)]
*  So maybe it was like there's a stud, just this fucking big dick stud who's been winking at the chief's wife. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1764.0s)]
*  And he's like, guess what, dude? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1769.0s)]
*  You get to go see God because you're so good at sports, we're going to fucking kill you. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1771.0s)]
*  And it's like so that your wife doesn't get fucked. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1775.0s)]
*  Well, how many dudes do they make fight to the death with swords for that? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1777.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1781.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1782.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1783.0s)]
*  Like the mountain guy. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1784.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1785.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1786.0s)]
*  And your wife is hanging around and you're the king just because you say so. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1787.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1789.0s)]
*  That kind of just fucking mush your head. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1790.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1792.0s)]
*  You had to kill him. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1793.0s)]
*  So you make them fight to the death. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1794.0s)]
*  Yeah, makes sense. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1795.0s)]
*  I guarantee that's probably how they did a lot of those things back then. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1796.0s)]
*  Every tradition, like why do you think every religion has a little hat that covers the bald spot? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1799.0s)]
*  Because some fucking guy, I think Yamakas, 100%. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1806.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1810.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1811.0s)]
*  The guy was insecure about his bald spot. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1812.0s)]
*  He's like, God said we actually have to cover this. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1814.0s)]
*  All of us. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1816.0s)]
*  Everyone. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1817.0s)]
*  Even you with the beautiful hair, Joseph. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1818.0s)]
*  People with the best fucking hair ever. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1819.0s)]
*  Like Jamie from Yellowstone. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1822.0s)]
*  Just thick manes of hair. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1824.0s)]
*  Sorry, bud. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1826.0s)]
*  Tough shit. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1827.0s)]
*  Put it in the cap. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1828.0s)]
*  Wear the hat. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1829.0s)]
*  God wants you to wear a fucking hat. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1830.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1831.0s)]
*  How about the pope gets to wear one like a fish's head? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1832.0s)]
*  What's that one? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1834.0s)]

*  You think it was just always a part of the church? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=1997.0s)]
*  Like, and people just started talking about it later in life? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2002.0s)]
*  Fully. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2006.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2007.0s)]

*  19. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2019.0s)]
*  The previous film was like 10, 12 years ago. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2020.0s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2021.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2022.0s)]
*  I mean, I think if you look at the history of the fucking Catholic Church, they were [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2023.0s)]
*  like, you know, popes were like poisoning each other and fucking all the time. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2026.0s)]
*  And it's like, even the thing where priests can't have kids, it's like, you look at that [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2031.0s)]
*  and it's like, were they just trying to not cover benefits? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2035.0s)]
*  Like, that's my sincere guess is that the pope at the time was trying to save money. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2038.0s)]
*  Because it's like, truly, that's really what I think. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2043.0s)]
*  And like, because like the Greek Orthodox Church, not saying we don't have fucking, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2046.0s)]
*  no one fucks. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2051.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure a couple of guys fuck kids, but it's like, you get to have a wife in the [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2052.0s)]
*  Greek Orthodox Church. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2055.0s)]
*  But the church covers your like family's living expenses and shit. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2057.0s)]
*  And I really think like the Catholic Church was just like, nah, nah, nah. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2060.0s)]
*  I think the origin of it was the priests were like rock stars. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2064.0s)]
*  Because if you think about if priests could fuck whoever they wanted to. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2069.0s)]
*  He's blinged out. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2072.0s)]

*  They got the necklace. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2074.0s)]
*  They look like rock stars. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2075.0s)]
*  They're the ones you get to talk in front of everybody and they have a special relationship [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2076.0s)]
*  with God. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2079.0s)]
*  Oh, God told me you have to suck me off, actually. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2080.0s)]
*  I saw it in a vision. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2083.0s)]
*  And you got to realize like up until like, when was Martin Luther? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2085.0s)]
*  I don't even fucking know. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2089.0s)]
*  Whenever that was. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2090.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Protestant revolution. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2091.0s)]
*  There's a great Dan Carlin hardcore history on that. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2092.0s)]
*  I love him. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2096.0s)]
*  Martin Luther. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2097.0s)]
*  And so he was the first guy to make the Bible interpret it phonetically so that people could [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2098.0s)]
*  read it. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2102.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2103.0s)]
*  Because everybody was just like. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2104.0s)]
*  It was in Latin and no one read Latin. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2105.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2106.0s)]
*  So this is in 1507. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2107.0s)]
*  So think about that. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2108.0s)]
*  And then in 15, up until 1507, you just had to listen to the priest. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2109.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2113.0s)]
*  You had to trust that what he was. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2114.0s)]
*  So that guy's a rock star. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2115.0s)]

*  That's really it. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2143.0s)]
*  Because it's like, think about how what a peasant we looked like, how fucked up their [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2144.0s)]

*  Right. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2153.0s)]

*  You're out in the fucking fields. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2156.0s)]
*  So imagine these priests, they get a little water. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2157.0s)]
*  They get to bathe every once in a while. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2160.0s)]
*  They get the, you're right. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2162.0s)]

*  Forget about it. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2166.0s)]
*  For another 400 years after that though, the mass was in Latin. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2167.0s)]
*  So you had to know Latin to understand what was even happening. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2170.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2173.0s)]
*  For 400 years after that, until what year? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2174.0s)]
*  About somewhere in the seventies or eighty five, depending on where. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2176.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2178.0s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2179.0s)]
*  But you could still read the Bible. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2180.0s)]
*  That totally makes sense. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2181.0s)]
*  You could read the Bible, but that guy's still talking this voodoo language, dressed like [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2182.0s)]
*  a wizard. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2187.0s)]
*  And then if you go to the Vatican, dude, that's the real eye opener. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2188.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2193.0s)]
*  I went to the Vatican on an edible. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2194.0s)]
*  Oh hell yeah. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2195.0s)]
*  And when I was walking around the Vatican, it kicked in while I was there. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2196.0s)]
*  So I took it and then I'm walking around. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2201.0s)]
*  And as I'm walking around, I'm going, this is all a pedophile cult's booty. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2204.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2210.0s)]
*  Like all their pirate booty. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2211.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2212.0s)]
*  Like if you really think about how many people have been involved in these pre scandals, like [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2213.0s)]
*  what is the number? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2219.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2220.0s)]
*  Throughout like history, God knows. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2221.0s)]
*  God knows. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2223.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2224.0s)]
*  Imagine that with any other thing. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2225.0s)]
*  Imagine that with carpenters. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2226.0s)]
*  Every time you got your house built, your kids got fucked. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2227.0s)]
*  Look, the fucking deck is pretty good though, huh? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2229.0s)]
*  You gotta keep the carpenters away from your kids. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2231.0s)]
*  Don't ever let the carpenters babysit your kids. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2234.0s)]
*  Imagine. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2237.0s)]
*  That would be fucking insane. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2238.0s)]
*  We'd be like, we gotta abolish carpenters. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2239.0s)]
*  Sorry, we're getting you shelves. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2241.0s)]
*  Everyone's gotta learn how to build their own house. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2242.0s)]
*  But when things are like a part of society for a long enough time and we grow up with [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2244.0s)]
*  them, we just accept them as being like a normal thing. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2249.0s)]
*  Not that anyone's normalizing abuse, but everybody, it's not. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2252.0s)]
*  They were though. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2255.0s)]
*  I mean the Catholic Church was doing that. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2256.0s)]
*  If you say Catholic priests, people think abuse. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2257.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2260.0s)]
*  It's an instant connection. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2261.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean that they're all doing it. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2263.0s)]
*  I'm sure most of them are absolutely not doing it. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2265.0s)]
*  Most of them are. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2267.0s)]
*  Most of them are great people. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2268.0s)]
*  A couple of them are putting up some real numbers, some real molestation numbers. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2269.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2271.56s)]
*  The Vatican revealed Tuesday that over the past decade has defrocked 848 priests who [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2272.56s)]
*  raped or molested children and sanctioned another 2,572 with lesser penalties, providing [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2279.0s)]
*  the first ever breakdown of how it handled more than 3,400 cases of abuse reported to [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2287.12s)]
*  the Holy See since 2004. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2293.4s)]
*  See, imagine that with any other business. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2296.12s)]
*  Any other industry. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2299.04s)]
*  Self-help. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2300.04s)]
*  Every time you went to a trader, they fucked your kid. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2301.04s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2306.12s)]
*  And it's a real thing. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2309.12s)]
*  It's like people are gonna get mad at us for even bringing it up. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2310.12s)]
*  But it's like, how can you get mad at something that's so insane? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2313.12s)]
*  That's my favorite, when they asked Bill Burr about that, that clip is the funniest thing [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2316.96s)]

*  married and have kids. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2449.52s)]

*  I'm like, is this guy reading so much religion because he wants to get rid of these feelings? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2498.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2504.08s)]

*  I definitely think that happens. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2506.08s)]

*  Especially because like I said, from age 7 to 11, I lived in San Francisco. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2522.68s)]
*  Gay people were just ... It was just normal. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2528.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2530.08s)]
*  It was so common. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2531.08s)]
*  So I grew up that way. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2532.88s)]
*  But moving to Florida in particular, and then again, moving to Boston, I realized, God, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2534.96s)]
*  a lot of people get real bummed out if their kid's gay. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2539.68s)]
*  It seemed like this dude was just ... I mean, I could be wrong. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2543.24s)]
*  Maybe he was just really into religion. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2547.0s)]
*  But for a fucking 17-year-old to be really, really, really into religion and carrying [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2548.72s)]
*  a Bible everywhere and reading everywhere, maybe that's changing him and giving him power. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2553.56s)]
*  Still. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2559.52s)]
*  But even still, I think anyone at that age, it's like, you don't want to lock yourself [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2560.52s)]
*  into something you can't get out of. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2564.06s)]
*  It's like, maybe he was very into religion, but maybe that was just a coping mechanism. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2566.3999999999996s)]
*  When he really sat and thought about who he was or whatever, it's like he didn't want [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2573.04s)]
*  to be it. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2576.4s)]
*  But then you're a fucking priest, and there's all this pressure. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2577.4s)]
*  Then since you've been studying, there's all this religious guilt and shit. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2579.4s)]
*  You probably stay into it. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2582.4s)]
*  Obviously, you feel bad if somebody ... We're just speculating here, but if he did get trapped [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2584.04s)]
*  in that kind of shit, that's tough. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2588.52s)]

*  Over the past 20 years, the average annual return for the endowment has been 11.2%, which [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2695.14s)]

*  surpasses the entire operating budget of the whole school. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2761.7s)]

*  I think we should forgive student debt, all that kind of shit. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2835.06s)]
*  But it is, Ivy Leagues in general, it's like so fucked, because they have the money. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2838.42s)]
*  Well, I think it would be wise if we gave it available to citizens. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2841.66s)]
*  What would be the harm in that? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2848.7799999999997s)]

*  You should be able to go to trade schools, all that kind of shit. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2870.62s)]
*  Well, I think you can learn online too. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2874.02s)]
*  There's a lot of universities. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2877.58s)]

*  I grew up in Baltimore, and I've had friends who went to Harvard and shit, and they were [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2897.7000000000003s)]

*  it is like a ... I think we are just fucking a generation of kids, especially when you [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=2922.46s)]

*  Like the main God, he couldn't stop getting side pussy. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3531.22s)]
*  It's like that's what our society, that's what our ancient society was built on. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3534.62s)]
*  He would like become a bull and just see a cow that looked hot. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3538.42s)]
*  He wouldn't even just fuck people. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3542.02s)]

*  I think, I mean, just like everything else, it's like you, it's people trying to make [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3565.2200000000003s)]

*  where that's, that's what their rulers were like. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3579.5s)]
*  So that's what Zeus was going to be like. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3581.62s)]
*  That's what makes people join cults. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3583.58s)]
*  That's what makes people woke. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3585.38s)]
*  That's what makes people everything. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3586.7000000000003s)]

*  it's like, you know, monotheism, it's pretty straightforward. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3615.02s)]
*  It's kind of boring. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3618.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3619.58s)]

*  He just dug a hole in some sand and beat off into it. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3786.86s)]
*  He was like, yeah. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3790.48s)]
*  She wasn't much of a kisser. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3791.48s)]
*  Fucking slow the way. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3793.48s)]

*  There is not. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3806.0400000000004s)]
*  I bet these are fucking crocodiles. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3807.0400000000004s)]
*  Crocodile where? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3809.0400000000004s)]
*  100% is a guy who fucked a crocodile. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3810.0400000000004s)]
*  Just to show you he could do it. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3812.0400000000004s)]
*  Maybe that's true. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3813.76s)]
*  This guy just lassoed a crocodile. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3814.76s)]
*  It doesn't seem very appealing. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3815.76s)]
*  Held him down, got hard, tied it off with a rope. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3816.76s)]
*  His dick like he's doing heroin just to keep it hard? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3821.76s)]
*  Made a homemade cock ring out of fucking animal skins, cinched it down, fucked that crocodile. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3824.76s)]
*  And became the chief of his village. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3830.76s)]
*  Yeah, you want to show people you're the boss. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3832.76s)]
*  Like some tribes, they have to kill a lion to show that they've become a man. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3835.76s)]
*  It's part of a coming of age ritual. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3841.76s)]
*  They've got to kill a lion with a fucking spear. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3844.76s)]
*  Dude, those guys would fuck a crocodile just to show you an ostrich. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3847.76s)]
*  You've got to catch an ostrich and then you've got to fuck it. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3851.76s)]
*  Fuck an ostrich pussy? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3854.76s)]
*  What's that got to do with a pussy? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3855.76s)]
*  They've got a cloaca. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3856.76s)]
*  As I was going to say, I feel like it's all too spiny. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3857.76s)]
*  It's shit and eggs. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3860.76s)]
*  It's everything in there. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3862.76s)]
*  I'm good, dude. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3863.76s)]
*  You've got to do it. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3864.76s)]
*  You've got to show everybody who the boss is. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3865.76s)]
*  One time in college we had a friend who we tried to convince him to fuck a horse. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3866.76s)]
*  He was the horniest guy I've ever seen in my life. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3871.76s)]
*  He was insane, dude. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3873.76s)]
*  I won't put him on blast. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3875.76s)]
*  I won't give any more details. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3876.76s)]
*  But if you went to UMBC and you went with me, you know who we're talking about here. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3878.76s)]
*  And he had an old lady who was his neighbor. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3882.76s)]
*  And she just came over to borrow a cup of sugar. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3886.76s)]
*  And he was 17 and he was talking about how he was beat off thinking about fucking this old lady. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3889.76s)]
*  He was a fucking lunatic. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3894.76s)]
*  And we were like, yo, dude, would you fuck an animal? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3896.76s)]
*  And he was like, nah, nah, nah. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3899.76s)]
*  And then he was like, what kind of animal? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3900.76s)]
*  And then we were clearly just fucking around. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3903.76s)]
*  And then we were like, what about? [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3906.76s)]
*  And then one of our friends lived on a farm. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3908.76s)]
*  And he was like, we have a horse in my farm. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3909.76s)]
*  And the guy was like, I'm not fucking a horse. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3912.76s)]
*  And then a minute later he's like, where does a horse pussy look like? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3913.76s)]
*  So then we're in the fucking dorms Googling horse pussy on Google Image. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3916.76s)]
*  And honestly, we found a pretty nice pic. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3922.76s)]
*  And he was like, hmm, OK. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3925.76s)]
*  And then he was like, I don't think so. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3927.76s)]
*  We're like, what if we give you 100 bucks? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3928.76s)]
*  He's like, nah, nah. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3930.76s)]
*  We're like, what about $400? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3931.76s)]
*  And he was like, all right, I'll do it. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3932.76s)]
*  And then the guy whose horse it was like, wait, you're gonna you want to fuck the horse? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3934.76s)]
*  He's like, no, it wasn't even the guy who was going to fuck the horse to back down. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3938.76s)]
*  It was the guy who owned the horse. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3941.76s)]
*  You don't want that to happen to your horse. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3943.76s)]
*  So this is 2000. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3944.76s)]
*  The horse will never trust you again. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3945.76s)]
*  Well, she was on her way out. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3946.76s)]
*  Apparently it was an old horse. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3947.76s)]
*  Did you ever see Zoo, the documentary Zoo? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3949.76s)]
*  No. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3951.76s)]
*  Zoo is about this community of people that met online. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3952.76s)]
*  And they found that there's a few states where it's legal to fuck animals. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3955.76s)]
*  And one of them was Washington state. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3958.76s)]
*  And they all got together and they met at this place where there's hundreds of hours of footage of them getting fucked by horses. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3960.76s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3969.76s)]
*  And one guy died. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3970.76s)]
*  Oh, is that Mr. Hands? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3971.76s)]
*  Mr. Hands. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3972.76s)]
*  Of course. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3973.76s)]
*  The legend. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3974.76s)]
*  So that guy died. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3975.76s)]
*  You've seen the video, right? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3976.76s)]
*  RIP Mr. Hands. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3977.76s)]
*  Of course. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3978.76s)]
*  It's one of the greatest videos in the history of the Internet. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3979.76s)]
*  Me and Brian Redband were going back and forth and he was sending me horrible things. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3980.76s)]
*  And then he sends me this one that says, I win. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3984.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3986.76s)]
*  And it's Mr. Hands. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3987.76s)]
*  I was like, this is the craziest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3988.76s)]
*  Dude, actually, I think that's how the horse conversation started. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3990.76s)]
*  Because I saw that video in college with this group of guys. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3995.76s)]
*  It was probably like, well, I wouldn't get fucked by a horse, obviously. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=3998.76s)]
*  But would you fuck a horse's pussy? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4001.76s)]
*  And I think that's maybe how we got there. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4003.76s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4005.76s)]
*  It's a crazy documentary because it's sort of a docu drama, right? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4006.76s)]
*  They kind of recreate stuff. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4009.76s)]
*  I see. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4010.76s)]
*  Just for entertainment. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4011.76s)]
*  But it's enough when they do interviews and stuff and it's enough for you to get a sense [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4012.76s)]
*  of what was going haywire with these humans that they decided that this was their thing. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4016.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4020.76s)]
*  People can find a thing. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4021.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4022.76s)]

*  They find a thing. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4025.76s)]
*  It happens to be a fucking sloth pussy. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4026.76s)]
*  Some people just want to get fucked by horses. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4028.76s)]
*  That's a thing. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4031.76s)]
*  Somebody just wants to suck a koala's dick. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4032.76s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4035.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4036.76s)]
*  But there's people like that out there for whatever reason. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4037.76s)]
*  They want to fuck animals. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4040.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it is. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4042.76s)]
*  That is the closest thing we have to like a Greek slur is like, you know, goat fucker [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4043.76s)]
*  or sheep fucker or something like that. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4048.76s)]
*  Well, there had to be a lot of that going on with those herders. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4050.76s)]

*  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4073.76s)]
*  Look at those fatties. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4074.76s)]
*  Yeah, listen. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4075.76s)]
*  That doesn't look that bad. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4076.76s)]
*  I guarantee. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4077.76s)]
*  I guarantee. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4078.76s)]
*  No ifs, ands, or buts. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4079.76s)]
*  Guys that fuck sheep. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4080.76s)]
*  Right? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4081.76s)]
*  That's 100%. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4082.76s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4083.76s)]
*  They're fucking sheep right now. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4084.76s)]
*  Right now. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4085.76s)]
*  So what about a monkey? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4086.76s)]
*  That's a harder. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4087.76s)]
*  Too unpredictable. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4088.76s)]
*  Remember Chappelle's bit? [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4089.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4090.76s)]
*  He had a great bit about that. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4091.76s)]
*  You know how hard it is to fuck a monkey? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4092.76s)]
*  Yeah, he gets it. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4094.76s)]
*  He just pictures that thing go on you, biting your dick. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4095.76s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4098.76s)]
*  Classic. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4099.76s)]
*  A monkey would fuck you up. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4100.76s)]
*  Oh, that's the thing. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4101.76s)]
*  Too unpredictable. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4102.76s)]
*  Yeah, too unpredictable. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4103.76s)]
*  What about a coyote? [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4104.76s)]
*  Anybody ever fuck a coyote? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4105.76s)]
*  Maybe one guy, one hard ass fucking Texas Ranger back in the day on a bet. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4106.76s)]
*  It would need to be two generations of domestication. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4109.76s)]
*  No, you lasso them. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4112.76s)]
*  You lasso them again? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4113.76s)]
*  You're gonna lasso the crocodile on the fucking island. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4114.76s)]
*  You're gonna lasso the crocodile on the fucking island. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4117.76s)]
*  You lasso them again? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4120.76s)]
*  You're gonna lasso the crocodile on the fucking island. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4121.76s)]
*  They made up lasso for a reason. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4123.76s)]
*  The fucking coyotes. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4125.76s)]
*  A lot of fucking animals, you gotta hold on to them. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4126.76s)]
*  I guess you're right. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4130.76s)]
*  Yeah, I never thought of it. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4131.76s)]
*  Why they invented the lasso? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4132.76s)]
*  Probably. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4133.76s)]
*  Ride on one animal and catch the other one with it. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4134.76s)]
*  100%. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4137.76s)]
*  Right? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4138.76s)]
*  And then whether or not you're doing it to fuck it, I think that's more like a bet. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4139.76s)]
*  That's up to you. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4141.76s)]
*  That's like a bet or to prove a point. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4142.76s)]
*  I don't think that's like why they invented the lasso. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4144.76s)]
*  Sure. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4146.76s)]
*  But I do think it was probably used. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4147.76s)]
*  It was you, for sure. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4148.76s)]
*  In the fucking of all animals in all history, what percentage of them involved lasso? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4149.76s)]
*  More than 10. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4154.76s)]
*  I would say more than, I don't know, because you gotta think, when the lasso was invented, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4156.76s)]
*  you could buy some pussy at the saloon. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4162.76s)]
*  Well, let's find out when the lasso was invented. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4164.76s)]
*  That's good. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4166.76s)]
*  We gotta get to the bottom of this. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4167.76s)]
*  Let's take a guess. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4168.76s)]
*  And then we just saw those delicious sheep pussies. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4169.76s)]
*  No lasso needed for those. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4171.76s)]
*  They'll probably push back. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4172.76s)]
*  You just get them up against a cliff. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4174.76s)]
*  Isn't that the idea? [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4177.76s)]
*  They would just back them to a cliff. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4179.76s)]
*  Hey, hey, why are you there? [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4181.76s)]
*  You teach your sheep to throw it back? [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4182.76s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4184.76s)]
*  Exactly, give them treats. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4186.76s)]
*  You want to carry it or not? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4188.76s)]
*  Without question, dude. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4190.76s)]
*  You're gonna work for this fucking sugar cube. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4191.76s)]
*  For sure. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4193.76s)]
*  Sugar cube. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4197.76s)]
*  Oh, it's perfect. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4198.76s)]
*  What's up? [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4200.76s)]
*  You gotta guess. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4201.76s)]
*  Lasso, I'm gonna say 1500s. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4202.76s)]
*  Lasso. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4203.76s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4204.76s)]
*  That's probably way earlier than that, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4205.76s)]
*  because they rode horses before that. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4207.76s)]
*  That's a problem. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4208.76s)]
*  What are we thinking here? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4209.76s)]
*  I'm gonna say 1100s. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4210.76s)]
*  Okay, yeah, that makes sense. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4212.76s)]
*  The step, the Turkic people. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4214.76s)]
*  Right, it was probably before that. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4216.76s)]
*  I'll say 1200s. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4218.76s)]
*  So, two answers to this. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4220.76s)]
*  1280 BC, there's images of a pharaoh holding a lasso, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4222.76s)]
*  holding onto a bull. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4227.76s)]
*  But the Huns used lassoes to ensnare opponents [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4229.76s)]
*  and hand to hand battle. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4233.76s)]
*  Oh, that makes sense. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4234.76s)]
*  And around 370 AD. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4236.76s)]
*  Wow, they used it for people first. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4238.76s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4240.76s)]
*  They probably raped them. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4241.76s)]
*  They probably did everything. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4242.76s)]
*  But those people must have been on horses. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4244.76s)]
*  So if they were on horses, how'd they get the horse? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4247.76s)]
*  The person using it was on a horse probably [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4249.76s)]
*  and stopped them from running away. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4251.76s)]
*  Right, but I'm saying how did they get the horse [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4253.76s)]
*  in the first place? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4255.76s)]
*  I think that's probably lassoes. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4257.76s)]
*  Horses were wild. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4259.76s)]
*  Thinking about it now, a lasso's probably been invented [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4261.76s)]
*  for like, you know, ancient times. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4263.76s)]
*  Forever. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4265.76s)]
*  But they probably had like five or six of them [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4266.76s)]
*  and they all, like, people held on [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4268.76s)]
*  until they could slow the horse down [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4270.76s)]
*  because they didn't have a horse to ride the lasso. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4271.76s)]
*  Right, right, right, right. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4273.76s)]
*  So, going back to our original question though. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4275.76s)]
*  Is it really an original question? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4277.76s)]
*  I think it was like how many animals have people fucked? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4279.76s)]
*  That was the original question. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4282.76s)]
*  The lasso. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4284.76s)]
*  I think a lasso hasn't been used. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4285.76s)]
*  I think most of it, I think most animal fucking [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4287.76s)]
*  is a matter of convenience. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4289.76s)]
*  I think most animal fucking is also after murder. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4291.76s)]
*  Like, where I already killed it. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4293.76s)]
*  Now it's definitely not going to push back. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4295.76s)]
*  You can't eat the asshole. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4297.76s)]
*  It's definitely not going to kick me. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4299.76s)]
*  You think someone cleaned it all out, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4301.76s)]
*  took the stakes off and just left the ass [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4303.76s)]
*  and used it like a little proto pocket pushy? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4305.76s)]
*  If you try to fuck a deer and it kicked you, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4307.76s)]
*  you could get ruined for the rest of your life. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4309.76s)]
*  Great point. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4311.76s)]
*  You've got to be careful back then. There's no doctors. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4313.76s)]
*  There's no doctors. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4315.76s)]
*  You're a fucking animal. You're taking a big risk. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4317.76s)]
*  Thinking of it now, respect to the guys in antiquity [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4319.76s)]
*  that were fucking animals. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4321.76s)]
*  Yeah. That's a fucking... [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4323.76s)]
*  Because if you got hurt, if you just got scratched, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4325.76s)]
*  you could get some horrible staph infection. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4327.76s)]
*  Bacteria, forget about it. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4329.76s)]
*  Yes, man. Somebody fucking people die. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4331.76s)]
*  Dustin Poirier is in the hospital right now [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4333.76s)]
*  from a staph infection. Jesus Christ. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4335.76s)]
*  Him and Connor are going back and forth about it [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4337.76s)]
*  on Instagram. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4339.76s)]
*  That's fucking hilarious. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4341.76s)]
*  Connor got mad because I said that his piss [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4343.76s)]
*  could melt a USADA cup. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4345.76s)]
*  He said it looks like my piss could melt a USADA cup too. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4347.76s)]
*  And he's correct. Yeah, you're not fighting. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4349.76s)]
*  Connor, I'm not hating that. You look great. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4351.76s)]
*  And by the way, he does have a legitimate [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4353.76s)]
*  reason for doing whatever the fuck he's doing, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4355.76s)]
*  even if he's doing nothing. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4357.76s)]
*  He broke his leg. It's a different thing. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4359.76s)]
*  I had talked to this guy, Derek, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4361.76s)]
*  from More Plates, More Dates. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4363.76s)]
*  We were discussing what's involved in trying to [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4365.76s)]
*  heal a broken bone like that. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4367.76s)]
*  It is really hard. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4369.76s)]
*  It's very hard for people to come back because [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4371.76s)]
*  that bone always has the potential to be weaker. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4373.76s)]
*  You've got screws in it now [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4375.76s)]
*  on a plate. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4377.76s)]
*  The only way it makes it better, apparently, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4379.76s)]
*  is if they put a rod through [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4381.76s)]
*  the entire bone. Then it will actually [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4383.76s)]
*  be stronger. But that could compromise [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4385.76s)]
*  your movement. Totally. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4387.76s)]
*  And also, it takes fucking forever to [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4389.76s)]
*  heal. So I get it, Connor. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4391.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the thing is, there are... [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4393.76s)]
*  That's Dustin's foot? What the fuck? [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4395.76s)]
*  Staph infection. Goddamn, dude. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4397.76s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? And apparently, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4399.76s)]
*  he said it's actually looking worse. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4401.76s)]
*  Even though they have him on [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4403.76s)]
*  all these antibiotics, it's not responding to it. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4405.76s)]
*  Jesus Christ. I'd rather look at the horse's pussy again. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4407.76s)]
*  That's brutal. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4409.76s)]
*  Staph infection scared the shit out of me. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4411.76s)]
*  Take care of your skin, kids. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4413.76s)]
*  Get yourself some defense soap. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4415.76s)]
*  If you're a grappler, in particular, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4417.76s)]
*  if you do MMA or anything like that, please [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4419.76s)]
*  get yourself some defense soap. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4421.76s)]
*  It's a natural [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4423.76s)]
*  antibiotic soap. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4425.76s)]
*  It's probiotic. It's good for the healthy [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4427.76s)]
*  bacteria in your skin, but it kills things [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4429.76s)]
*  like staph and stuff that's going to [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4431.76s)]
*  get you sick. And they have a whole bunch [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4433.76s)]
*  of products, but they have soaps, and it's great [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4435.76s)]
*  soap. It's got tea tree oil and eucalyptus [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4437.76s)]
*  oil. It's all natural. It doesn't fuck [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4439.76s)]
*  up your natural skin flora. But [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4441.76s)]
*  when I learned about that stuff, I'd gotten [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4443.76s)]
*  staph twice. Really? Holy fuck. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4445.76s)]
*  Staph's scary, man. I guess because of all the grappling [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4447.76s)]
*  and shit. Yeah, you get sc... [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4449.76s)]
*  Thank God that my friend Tate, he's the one who pointed it out. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4451.76s)]
*  I was wearing shorts, and he saw my [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4453.76s)]
*  calf. We were at the airport. Oh, fuck. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4455.76s)]
*  He goes, what's going on in your calf? It looked like little [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4457.76s)]
*  zits all over the place. I go, nothing. Fuck. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4459.76s)]

*  Right away. Good, damn. Ari [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4463.76s)]
*  got staph. Fuck. And Ari [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4465.76s)]

*  He got it on his penis? He got it in a parking lot. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4469.76s)]
*  No, he had it on his... Ari was doing jujitsu [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4473.76s)]
*  for a while. Wow. Hilarious. He got it [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4475.76s)]
*  on his knee, and we were playing pool, and he was limping [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4477.76s)]
*  around. I go, why are you limping? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4479.76s)]
*  Playing pool. He goes, oh, I got a fucking spider bite. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4481.76s)]
*  I go, what? I go, let me see [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4483.76s)]

*  And it's bad. God damn. It's bad. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4495.76s)]
*  And so he immediately had to get on [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4497.76s)]
*  antibiotics. It was... Jesus Christ. If he didn't [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4499.76s)]
*  know, and he let it go, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4501.76s)]
*  it would have got way worse, and then it gets... you can get [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4503.76s)]

*  Oh, no! [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4629.76s)]
*  This is not the same one. Oh, the tail is moving! [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4631.76s)]
*  He's still alive! He's still alive, man. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4633.76s)]
*  He's just literally getting pulled apart. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4635.76s)]
*  He's still alive. Jesus Christ, that sucks. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4637.76s)]
*  I hate that. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4639.76s)]

*  That looks like a baboon. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4643.76s)]
*  That's a baboon. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4645.76s)]
*  That poor baboon and his little red nuts. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4647.76s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ, they're so scary, these fucking things. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4649.76s)]
*  They really are. You know what fucks me up though [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4651.76s)]
*  I mean, it feels like how convenient that you managed to be [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4653.76s)]
*  two feet away while this baboon got a hold [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4655.76s)]
*  Did you push that fucking baboon [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4657.76s)]
*  towards that thing? They definitely did, right? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4659.76s)]
*  They definitely did. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4661.76s)]
*  Or they just have a camera set up. Look at the saliva, man. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4663.76s)]
*  The saliva that comes out of their mouth. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4665.76s)]
*  Look at all that funk. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4667.76s)]
*  They're so gross, man. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4669.76s)]
*  That is fucking disgusting. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4671.76s)]
*  Oh my God, his fucking shoulder's all fucked. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4673.76s)]
*  Yeah, see this guy filming it up close? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4675.76s)]
*  They're put...oh, fuck, dude. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4677.76s)]
*  Look at the slime. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4679.76s)]
*  Truly disgusting. The slime leaking out of his mouth. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4681.76s)]
*  Yeah, bro! Look at that thing he's getting in his kayak! [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4683.76s)]
*  Oh, dude, you're so fucked. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4685.76s)]
*  You are so fucked. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4687.76s)]
*  That thing's climbing in the kayak with you? [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4689.76s)]
*  They're only in that little island, right? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4691.76s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4693.76s)]
*  I think there's a couple of islands. Is there more than one island or just that one? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4695.76s)]
*  There's a couple islands in that area that have that. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4697.76s)]
*  How many different islands have the Komodo Dragon on them? [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4699.76s)]
*  I thought they were just in one. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4701.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think primarily in one. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4703.76s)]
*  But yeah, they definitely look like... [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4705.76s)]
*  They feel like a monster. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4707.76s)]
*  There's a thing called island dwarfism, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4709.76s)]
*  where like elephants, when they come on a place, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4711.76s)]
*  they get small. Oh, here it is. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4713.76s)]
*  Few Indonesian islands [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4715.76s)]
*  of the Lesser Sunda group, including [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4717.76s)]
*  Rinjah, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4719.76s)]
*  Padar, and Flores. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4721.76s)]
*  And of course the island of Komodo, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4723.76s)]
*  the largest, 22 miles long. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4725.76s)]
*  They have not been seen on the island of [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4727.76s)]
*  Padar since the 1970s. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4729.76s)]
*  The island of Flores is where those hobbit people live. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4731.76s)]
*  Oh, really? The little hobbit people? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4733.76s)]
*  Yeah, those little tiny people used to live. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4735.76s)]
*  They killed like a [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4737.76s)]
*  missionary or whatever the fuck? [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4739.76s)]
*  No, I don't know. Do they? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4741.76s)]
*  Is that a story? No, it's the Sentinel Island people. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4743.76s)]
*  Oh, you're thinking of North Sentinel Island. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4745.76s)]
*  No, that's an Indian Ocean. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4747.76s)]
*  That's the people that lived alongside [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4749.76s)]
*  of human beings like 100,000 years ago. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4751.76s)]
*  And they're these little tiny people [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4753.76s)]
*  that were like three feet tall. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4755.76s)]
*  And they had tools and weapons and shit. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4757.76s)]
*  They were just little hobbits. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4759.76s)]
*  So that's that island dwarfism thing. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4761.76s)]
*  So in islands, for whatever reason, [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4763.76s)]
*  I guess because there's limited resources. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4765.76s)]
*  Elephants get smaller, mammals get smaller, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4767.76s)]
*  deer get smaller, but [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4769.76s)]
*  lizards get bigger. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4771.76s)]
*  Whoa, that sucks. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4773.76s)]
*  That sucks. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4775.76s)]
*  That fucking sucks, dude. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4777.76s)]
*  So that's why the island of Komodo [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4779.76s)]
*  has these fucking things. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4781.76s)]
*  So the biggest lizards on Earth, on an island. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4783.76s)]
*  Goddamn. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4785.76s)]
*  Fuck that, dude. Get the lizards out of there, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4787.76s)]
*  go in there, you get to feel fucking tall. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4789.76s)]
*  Stranded divers had to fight off Komodo dragons [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4791.76s)]
*  to survive. Oh my God. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4793.76s)]
*  The divers who went missing off Indonesia [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4795.76s)]
*  were forced to beat off deadly Komodo [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4797.76s)]
*  dragons with the lead weights [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4799.76s)]
*  of their diving belts as they were repeatedly [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4801.76s)]
*  attacked. One of the survivors [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4803.76s)]
*  disclosed last night. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4805.76s)]
*  Can you imagine all you got is the weights on your diving [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4807.76s)]
*  belt and you have to whack a Komodo [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4809.76s)]
*  dragon with it? What does it say here? [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4811.76s)]
*  They spent 10 hours [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4813.76s)]
*  stuck in shark-infested water. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4815.76s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4817.76s)]
*  Oh my God, had been swept away and spun around [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4819.76s)]
*  for 10 hours in shark-infested waters. They reached [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4821.76s)]
*  the beach on a remote island at nightfall [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4823.76s)]
*  only to find it was inhabited by Komodo [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4825.76s)]
*  dragons. Jesus Christ. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4827.76s)]
*  The world's largest and most deadly lizards. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4829.76s)]
*  Well, at least we'll get a nice night's rest on this island. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4831.76s)]
*  This is a great movie. Did all of them live? [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4833.76s)]
*  There was a woman with them? A Swedish woman who was [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4835.76s)]
*  with the group told how she fought off [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4837.76s)]
*  a terrifying reptile three times [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4839.76s)]
*  with her weight belt. Jesus Christ. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4841.76s)]
*  Used by divers to maintain their buoyancy underwater. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4843.76s)]
*  The 10-foot carnivorous predator [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4845.76s)]
*  came within inches of biting her bare [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4847.76s)]
*  feet. It chewed on the lead [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4849.76s)]
*  in the belt before finally retreating as [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4851.76s)]
*  the divers threw rocks at its head. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4853.76s)]
*  God damn, dude. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4855.76s)]
*  Oh my God. I tried to have a go at my [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4857.76s)]
*  feet. Oh my God. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4859.76s)]

*  Swimming up to the people [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4939.76s)]
*  with this human body. Look, he's showing it to them. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4941.76s)]
*  That fucking sucks. He's looking up [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4943.76s)]
*  at them and as the bridge [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4945.76s)]
*  goes, he goes. Jesus Christ. So he's going [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4947.76s)]
*  down the bridge like he's on a fucking runway. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4949.76s)]
*  On a stroll. Yeah, yeah. He's displaying [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4951.76s)]
*  his trophy to all these people. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4953.76s)]
*  He's letting them know that he killed a person. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4955.76s)]
*  It's like you motherfuckers could be next. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4957.76s)]
*  That's a big fucking problem, too. Bro, look at that guy. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4959.76s)]
*  That poor guy face down. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4961.76s)]
*  That was someone's son. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4963.76s)]
*  That was someone's baby boy. They didn't eat him? [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4965.76s)]
*  What the fuck? They'll eat him eventually. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4967.76s)]
*  But look what he's doing. Look at the size of that thing. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4969.76s)]

*  dinosaur. Poor guy. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4973.76s)]
*  And we're so weird because if crocodiles [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4975.76s)]
*  could kill all of us, if we killed [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4977.76s)]
*  crocodiles and they go, hey, we just kill all the people, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4979.76s)]
*  then we don't have to worry about people anymore. They'd be like, yeah, let's kill the people. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4981.76s)]
*  But with us, we're like, you gotta keep them alive. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4983.76s)]
*  They're a part of the ecosystem. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4985.76s)]
*  If I lived [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4987.76s)]
*  there, I would be like the punisher for crocodiles. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4989.76s)]

*  to killing crocodiles. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4995.76s)]
*  I would just go out there with a fucking spotlight [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4997.76s)]
*  and a shotgun. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=4999.76s)]
*  And just be murking them everywhere I went. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5001.76s)]

*  And then some little bird that they eat [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5007.76s)]
*  just overruns the island, but fuck it, dude. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5009.76s)]
*  You got the crocs. Who cares? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5011.76s)]
*  Fuck you. I'll kill the little birds. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5013.76s)]
*  Take some photos of them. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5015.76s)]

*  This fucking blows. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5021.76s)]
*  Why do we keep things [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5023.76s)]
*  around that'll kill us? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5025.76s)]

*  Well, people who like that with bears, [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5081.76s)]
*  I mean, bears are not much different. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5083.76s)]
*  They're less [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5085.76s)]
*  likely to kill you, but when they do, it's just [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5087.76s)]
*  like that. Yeah. Horrific. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5089.76s)]

*  Yeah. Look how it does it, though. It's even quicker [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5101.76s)]
*  than a snake, though, because it [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5103.76s)]
*  just clamps it down, throws [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5105.76s)]
*  it back. How disgusting the fucking [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5107.76s)]

*  of the size of its body. Yeah. And it's [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5113.76s)]
*  walking around right now with the hooves [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5115.76s)]
*  sticking out the front of his mouth because [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5117.76s)]
*  he can't quite swallow it all down. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5119.76s)]
*  Zero gag reflex. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5121.76s)]
*  It could eat up to 80% of its body size [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5123.76s)]
*  or weight. Jesus Christ. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5125.76s)]
*  80% of its body size. Look at it. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5127.76s)]
*  It doesn't even look fat. No, dude, that's a [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5129.76s)]
*  lean guy. It just ate a whole deer. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5131.76s)]
*  Fuck it. And he's walking away. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5133.76s)]
*  But he's got a deer in his gut, now he's looking [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5135.76s)]
*  to eat more. Dude, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5137.76s)]

*  I like being dumb as shit and having [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5155.76s)]
*  a good time. Let me see my little squirrels. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5157.76s)]

*  Yeah, but that's smart. It's hard to do. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5175.76s)]
*  Smart people can't do it. A lot of smart [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=5177.76s)]

*  for all the foods in your body. Right. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6069.76s)]
*  Which I think a normal human requirement. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6071.76s)]
*  Like there's a thing, if you [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6073.76s)]
*  just get the food from somewhere else, I bet [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6075.76s)]
*  party is like where's this coming from? Shut up. Yeah. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6077.76s)]
*  You have to like squash [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6079.76s)]

*  this fucking microwave burrito [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6083.76s)]
*  is just not supposed to be in our body. There's these human [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6085.76s)]
*  reward systems that are inside of us and I always equate [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6087.76s)]
*  it to like catching a fish. When you catch [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6089.76s)]
*  a fish there's a fucking feeling when you catch a fish [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6091.76s)]
*  like oh shit, there's an excitement. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6093.76s)]
*  When you catch a fish that I [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6095.76s)]
*  think is primal and I think it goes back to [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6097.76s)]
*  that meant you feed your family. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6099.76s)]
*  Right. Because back in the day when they first [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6101.76s)]
*  invented fishing, thousands of [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6103.76s)]
*  years ago that's what it meant. They first figured that [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6105.76s)]
*  out. So when you get a fish you're like [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6107.76s)]
*  we survive. It's so much so [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6109.76s)]
*  that people love to catch fish and put them [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6111.76s)]
*  back. Yeah. Totally. Just for [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6113.76s)]
*  the rush. It's left over. They just fuck [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6115.76s)]
*  with the fish and they have [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6117.76s)]
*  special hooks like when they go fly fishing [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6119.76s)]
*  that are barbless. So you [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6121.76s)]
*  don't fuck them up. So you catch these trout and you just [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6123.76s)]
*  release them. Damn. Yeah well [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6125.76s)]
*  I don't think he's thinking of it spiritually. He's just the fucking [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6127.76s)]
*  he's drunk as shit all the time. He's [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6129.76s)]
*  just like the spiritual. I know he's not [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6131.76s)]

*  about it. It's a great life. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6135.76s)]

*  you think that was probably most humans? [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6149.76s)]
*  If you look at [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6151.76s)]
*  testosterone rates in this country, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6153.76s)]
*  that's what I was going to say earlier. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6155.76s)]
*  James Cameron said that testosterone [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6157.76s)]
*  is a toxin that men need to remove [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6159.76s)]
*  from their bodies. James Cameron? James Cameron [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6161.76s)]

*  that you have to cross. Right. To be [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6667.76s)]
*  able to like let your sexual crimes be. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6669.76s)]
*  Right. You know. But it's also R Kelly's [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6671.76s)]
*  songs were so sexual. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6673.76s)]
*  That's the thing. It's like this was written about [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6675.76s)]
*  someone doing algebra homework. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6677.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6679.76s)]
*  MJ wasn't doing. His were just good [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6681.76s)]
*  fucking songs. ABC. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6683.76s)]
*  It's easy as one two three. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6685.76s)]
*  The clues were all there. Literally. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6687.76s)]
*  Well he was a child [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6689.76s)]
*  then. Yeah. That's the thing. When he sang [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6691.76s)]
*  that he was a little boy. Yeah I mean [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6693.76s)]
*  this is well trod territory but that's a guy [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6695.76s)]
*  whose life is the most fucked up of all time. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6697.76s)]
*  Well it is well trod territory but are you [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6699.76s)]
*  aware of the castrata [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6701.76s)]
*  theory? The theory that he got his nuts [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6703.76s)]
*  chopped off? Yeah. I did not hear this. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6705.76s)]
*  From his own doctor. His doctor says [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6707.76s)]
*  he was chemically castrated. The same doctor [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6709.76s)]
*  that killed him by [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6711.76s)]
*  anesthetizing him every night. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6713.76s)]
*  That same doctor said that [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6715.76s)]
*  he was chemically castrated when he was [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6717.76s)]
*  young. And that's how he maintained his [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6719.76s)]
*  voice. That's wild. What's [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6721.76s)]
*  wild is that that was a thing. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6723.76s)]
*  That they used to do that to young boys to get him [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6725.76s)]
*  to sing opera. Yeah yeah yeah. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6727.76s)]
*  Fucking bro. And being a eunuch and shit that's [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6729.76s)]
*  more history shit. It's like a guy [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6731.76s)]
*  if your shit wasn't going so good your lower class [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6733.76s)]
*  it's like chop your dick off and I can [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6735.76s)]
*  trust you around my wife. Yeah. And then you can [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6737.76s)]
*  hang around the house. Yeah. And it's like damn I don't [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6739.76s)]
*  know if I would have made that trade. Bro. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6741.76s)]
*  That's that super creepy [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6743.76s)]
*  guy in Game of Thrones. Yeah yeah very. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6745.76s)]
*  Fucking canavi little [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6747.76s)]
*  dickless wonder. Yeah. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6749.76s)]
*  Out there trying to run the world. You don't [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6751.76s)]
*  want that guy around. They're probably more like [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6753.76s)]
*  him than they were like obedient. Yeah. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6755.76s)]
*  They're probably angry as fuck. You took your dick away. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6757.76s)]
*  I wonder. All they [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6759.76s)]
*  get is free fruit. Yeah free. I wonder [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6761.76s)]
*  if you could still bust from your ass. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6763.76s)]
*  If they got your dick off. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6765.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6767.76s)]
*  Even wonder. You gotta [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6769.76s)]
*  figure it out. I guess if you like massage the [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6771.76s)]
*  stump while you're fingering your butt. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6773.76s)]
*  Because they don't take the prostate out. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6775.76s)]
*  Right the prostate is still there. How does the [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6777.76s)]
*  jizz come out? It probably comes out in the most [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6779.76s)]
*  disappointing looking like. It's a dribble. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6781.76s)]
*  It's like soft [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6783.76s)]
*  serve ice cream. Yeah when the machine's [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6785.76s)]
*  down. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6787.76s)]
*  It's probably so sad. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6789.76s)]
*  Syrupy. The saddest nut [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6791.76s)]
*  you'll ever bust. Interesting I wonder [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6793.76s)]
*  if castratos could bust through their ass. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6795.76s)]
*  I wonder if they kept their penis [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6797.76s)]
*  but they just removed their testicles. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6799.76s)]
*  That's more likely what they did. Probably. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6801.76s)]
*  With eunuchs I don't know how they handled it. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6803.76s)]
*  I think they might have just the whole thing. The whole thing's gotta [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6805.76s)]
*  go. That's tough. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6807.76s)]
*  They should have given. They should have given from the little hole. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6809.76s)]
*  That sucks. Give them a little dick. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6811.76s)]
*  Oh Jesus Christ. The whole thing is [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6813.76s)]
*  so terrifying that that was a common [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6815.76s)]
*  practice. Or at least common enough [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6817.76s)]
*  that we know of it. I think it was pretty common. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6819.76s)]
*  I don't know. Cause in all the like [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6821.76s)]
*  history podcasts and books and shit [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6823.76s)]
*  there's a lot of fucking eunuchs [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6825.76s)]
*  running around. And that's one of the things [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6827.76s)]
*  that was throughout history [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6829.76s)]
*  people did to people in war. Cut their [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6831.76s)]
*  dick off stuff in their mouth. That's a tough one. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6833.76s)]
*  It's like come on man. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6835.76s)]
*  You got your own dick in your mouth as you're watching the [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6837.76s)]
*  axe come down. That's gotta be a special kind of [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6839.76s)]
*  horror. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6841.76s)]
*  That's what it pays to have a little penis. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6843.76s)]
*  I'll put it [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6845.76s)]
*  under my tongue like a tic tac. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6847.76s)]
*  God damn man. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6849.76s)]
*  You could spit your dick back out Adam. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6851.76s)]
*  What do you gotta lose at that point? So we talk about like [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6853.76s)]
*  declining sperm counts. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6855.76s)]
*  And how they're happening right now. Like there's all these [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6857.76s)]
*  studies done on men's sperm counts since [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6859.76s)]
*  like the 1950s. There's rapid decline. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6861.76s)]
*  If you go back in history doesn't it make [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6863.76s)]
*  sense that they would go up and up and up? [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6865.76s)]
*  Like I think when it was really hard [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6867.76s)]
*  to stay alive I think people were [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6869.76s)]
*  probably ultra hyper horny. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6871.76s)]
*  Because you only had a small window. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6873.76s)]
*  As long as you had food. You didn't have [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6875.76s)]
*  food so you weren't [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6877.76s)]
*  starving you're probably super horny. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6879.76s)]
*  Because they were probably wilder people. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6881.76s)]
*  But at the same time you're probably so fucking [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6883.76s)]
*  overworked. You're so you know it's like [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6885.76s)]
*  I think it's probably the way like height goes [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6887.76s)]
*  in society where it's like everyone was [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6889.76s)]
*  the more nourished you are. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6891.76s)]
*  I think there's probably we hit a point [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6893.76s)]
*  where it's like we have the most comforts. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6895.76s)]
*  We have the most nourished and we're kind of like [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6897.76s)]
*  you know not as overworked. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6899.76s)]
*  And I think that's probably [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6901.76s)]
*  just you know fully have no [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6903.76s)]
*  fucking clue. No that makes sense. But it [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6905.76s)]
*  makes sense you're saying with resources. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6907.76s)]
*  But if there was like a resource rich area. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6909.76s)]
*  Like say if there was an area where [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6911.76s)]
*  people were hunter gatherers [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6913.76s)]
*  and they grew some food and [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6915.76s)]
*  they all did like your uncle does [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6917.76s)]
*  in Greece. They all lived off the land. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6919.76s)]
*  They all took pictures of women's [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6921.76s)]
*  breasts with their Motorola flip phone too. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6923.76s)]
*  They're well nourished. But they're [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6925.76s)]
*  well nourished but they're people that are living a thousand [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6927.76s)]
*  two thousand years ago. Like they probably [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6929.76s)]
*  were horny as fuck. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6931.76s)]
*  There's probably like a [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6933.76s)]
*  I would say a slim majority [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6935.76s)]
*  that is the horniest guys of all time. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6937.76s)]
*  But I think most of them are just [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6939.76s)]
*  so beaten down by how fucking [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6941.76s)]
*  atrocious their lifestyle is. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6943.76s)]
*  That it's like you know. Yeah that's true too. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6945.76s)]
*  But the young guys who aren't beaten down yet [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6947.76s)]
*  they got to be the most horrific. And at the same [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6949.76s)]
*  time when you're so beaten down what do you have if not [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6951.76s)]
*  busting a nut? [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6953.76s)]
*  Killing people. Yeah. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6955.76s)]
*  Killing people and eating roast lamb. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6957.76s)]

*  Blinged out just fucking hanging [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6989.76s)]
*  and that was very interesting. I read a book about [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6991.76s)]
*  the medieval times where it's like [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6993.76s)]
*  church was just honestly people were just hanging out. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6995.76s)]
*  Like it was kind of like a bar. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6997.76s)]
*  Social dwelling. Social yeah. The priest [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=6999.76s)]
*  was reading shit but no one could [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7001.76s)]
*  really understand. They didn't know Latin. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7003.76s)]
*  They were just fucking hanging out. It's kind of interesting [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7005.76s)]
*  because it was like it makes sense. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7007.76s)]
*  What year did they make it so the [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7009.76s)]
*  Catholic priests had to take a vow of chastity? [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7011.76s)]
*  I don't know. Let's find that out. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7013.76s)]
*  I guarantee [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7015.76s)]
*  that was in response to them banging everybody. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7017.76s)]
*  I guarantee you. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7019.76s)]
*  I still think it's because they wouldn't have to pay [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7021.76s)]
*  the equivalent of child support. I don't think they [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7023.76s)]
*  That's too complicated [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7025.76s)]
*  a scheme. I think more [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7027.76s)]
*  likely is they had to put a stop to [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7029.76s)]
*  these guys banging everybody. But see would that [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7031.76s)]
*  put a stop to it? Couldn't they still keep [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7033.76s)]
*  getting? I think they probably did it in those fucking [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7035.76s)]
*  confession booths. That was probably their idea. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7037.76s)]
*  That's how it started. The first glory hole. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7039.76s)]
*  In between. Open that [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7041.76s)]

*  How many of those were [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7045.76s)]
*  glory holes? A hundred of them. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7047.76s)]
*  That's pretty cool. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7049.76s)]
*  Alright. I'm back in on the Catholic church. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7051.76s)]
*  If you can find me artifacts of [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7053.76s)]
*  glory holes I'm in. I used to do a joke [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7055.76s)]
*  about it. Imagine the [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7057.76s)]
*  idea where you take a guy who's not allowed to [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7059.76s)]
*  masturbate or have sex ever. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7061.76s)]
*  Then you make him listen to fuck stories [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7063.76s)]

*  some of the shit especially [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7115.76s)]
*  in cities and stuff like that it wasn't as brutal [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7117.76s)]

*  certainly that happened a lot but there was also [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7121.76s)]
*  like I think a little [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7123.76s)]
*  bit of how dirty and shit it was is [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7125.76s)]
*  a little overblown too. But I'm interested [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7127.76s)]
*  in that. I think there was a high [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7129.76s)]
*  level of sophistication in comparison [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7131.76s)]
*  to a lot of other cultures [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7133.76s)]
*  back then. But in terms of [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7135.76s)]

*  fuck I don't really want to do podcasts. And then [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7295.76s)]
*  like it was like six months. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7297.76s)]
*  And I was on the road and I was doing all this shit [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7299.76s)]
*  and it's like it is you [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7301.76s)]

*  much talking to people like we do. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7319.76s)]
*  No it's true. I think that's [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7321.76s)]
*  I think it's important for yourself. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7323.76s)]
*  It's important for how you [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7325.76s)]
*  understand how people like everybody [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7327.76s)]
*  has a different style of communication [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7329.76s)]

*  and everybody has different things they do for a living. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7333.76s)]
*  Everybody has a different approach. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7335.76s)]
*  And I think I'm just like gathering [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7337.76s)]
*  data. Like all the time. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7339.76s)]
*  I'm so much more aware of things [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7341.76s)]
*  now than I ever was when I first [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7343.76s)]
*  started doing this. Yeah I think that's [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7345.76s)]
*  true and I think also it's like it recharges [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7347.76s)]
*  you too right? Because it's like [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7349.76s)]
*  especially post pandemic shit where it was [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7351.76s)]
*  like going out and actually getting to fucking [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7353.76s)]
*  talk to somebody and like you know [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7355.76s)]
*  you gather data. Also it's like you're in a place in your [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7357.76s)]
*  life where it's like like it took [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7359.76s)]

*  like best friends and just kicking it. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7373.76s)]

*  about this thing. I don't care. I don't need [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7387.76s)]
*  my needs have evolved. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7389.76s)]
*  Well the thing is it's stimulating [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7391.76s)]
*  but it's not an urge. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7393.76s)]
*  See sex is stimulating [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7395.76s)]
*  but it's an urge. So sex is a [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7397.76s)]
*  biological urge. So you get horny. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7399.76s)]
*  When guys get horny. Like we get horny. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7401.76s)]
*  And [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7403.76s)]
*  when you don't get intellectually horny [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7405.76s)]
*  but it is stimulating. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7407.76s)]
*  So you have to like trick yourself [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7409.76s)]
*  into engaging in it. And then once you engage [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7411.76s)]
*  in it you go oh this is fascinating. That's how I am [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7413.76s)]
*  with like documentaries and [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7415.76s)]
*  books and like I have to get engaged [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7417.76s)]
*  with it. And then once I get engaged with it I'm like oh I really [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7419.76s)]
*  do enjoy this. No that's true. It [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7421.76s)]
*  almost feels like a roller coaster where you have to just kind [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7423.76s)]
*  of push yourself to engage. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7425.76s)]
*  And then once you do it's like fucking bombs away. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7427.76s)]
*  Because it's like logically you know there's a lot [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7429.76s)]
*  of things you like to do but you don't engage in [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7431.76s)]
*  doing them for whatever reason right. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7433.76s)]
*  But then the urges are food. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7435.76s)]
*  You have an urge to eat. You get hungry. You get [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7437.76s)]
*  horny. You get tired. You want to go to sleep. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7439.76s)]
*  You got to take a piss. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7441.76s)]
*  There's all these urges. But you don't have [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7443.76s)]
*  an urge for intellectual curiosity [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7445.76s)]
*  or even an urge to be creative. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7447.76s)]
*  It's just like you know [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7449.76s)]
*  it's good to sit down and write because that's where the jokes come from. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7451.76s)]
*  But you don't have like [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7453.76s)]
*  an urge like you have an urge to eat. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7455.76s)]
*  Right. And that's why [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7457.76s)]
*  I feel so great when sometimes it does strike you. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7459.76s)]
*  And you're like whoa this does feel [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7461.76s)]
*  natural biological [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7463.76s)]
*  almost. But you're never going to beat the fuck urge. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7465.76s)]
*  No. Never. Doesn't have a chance. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7467.76s)]
*  The fuck urge sells [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7469.76s)]
*  cars and watches [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7471.76s)]

*  anything fake. Yeah. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7551.76s)]
*  They could literally [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7553.76s)]

*  I have thought about this [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7559.76s)]
*  where it's like if what would be the equivalent [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7561.76s)]

*  penis implants if they were real. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7565.76s)]
*  If they were the way titties look. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7567.76s)]
*  I'd get it tomorrow. The thing is a guy [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7569.76s)]
*  couldn't do that because a woman wouldn't like [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7571.76s)]

*  Right. Right. True. Fake hair is a tough one. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7581.76s)]
*  That's why I'm looking like this. But fake hair [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7583.76s)]
*  is nothing compared to a fake dick. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7585.76s)]

*  Pills to make you to grow your cock. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7595.76s)]
*  I used to have a bit about it. The [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7597.76s)]
*  day they invent a big dick [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7599.76s)]

*  guy died of an overdose. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7605.76s)]
*  I didn't know I was just going to take one. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7607.76s)]
*  How many give me a stroke. I'm going to take [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7609.76s)]
*  one less than give me a stroke. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7611.76s)]
*  And I had a whole bit about how dicks would become [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7613.76s)]
*  so big that guys would have to push them around [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7615.76s)]
*  in shopping carts. And women would evolve [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7617.76s)]
*  to have these giant flying squirrel [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7619.76s)]
*  pussy people. And the guys would [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7621.76s)]
*  chase them up to the top of cliffs and they would leap to safety. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7623.76s)]
*  It was the dumbest thing ever. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7625.76s)]
*  That's when you rode high as hell. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7627.76s)]
*  But it's obviously like [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7629.76s)]

*  Yes, yes, yes. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7799.76s)]
*  If you could get a bigger dick. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7801.76s)]
*  Isn't it fascinating that we can put [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7803.76s)]

*  They're underneath. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7813.76s)]
*  He's stretched them down. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7815.76s)]
*  Or maybe he cut them off [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7817.76s)]
*  because he didn't like the aesthetic. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7819.76s)]
*  Oh there's his nipples. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7821.76s)]
*  His nipples are way below the tit. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7823.76s)]
*  He's got the tummy tuck stomach too. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7825.76s)]

*  Yeah, he's done for sure. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7837.76s)]
*  If you're doing that, your body is filled [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7839.76s)]
*  with this invasive agent [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7841.76s)]
*  that's just making you swell up. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7843.76s)]
*  So unnatural. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7845.76s)]
*  The reality is I want to lose a little weight [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7847.76s)]
*  because I want to feel better. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7849.76s)]
*  But I like how I look. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7851.76s)]
*  I feel bad for people that have [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7853.76s)]
*  that extreme body dysmorphia. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7855.76s)]
*  I think being fat is fun. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7857.76s)]
*  Everyone likes a jolly fat guy. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7859.76s)]
*  I like my hair. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7861.76s)]
*  You just want to be healthy. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7863.76s)]
*  I just want to feel better. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7865.76s)]
*  The problem is those two don't really coincide [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7867.76s)]
*  with each other that well. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7869.76s)]
*  But you can make a comfortable medium. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7871.76s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7873.76s)]
*  I'm 300 pounds now, right? [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7875.76s)]
*  I could lose 60 easy. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7877.76s)]
*  Still be pretty fat, but be much healthier than this. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7879.76s)]
*  Same guy. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7881.76s)]
*  He does look bigger. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7883.76s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7885.76s)]
*  He pumped it up further. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7887.76s)]
*  He's got the Super Saiyan editing. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7889.76s)]
*  That is so insane. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7891.76s)]
*  That guy's going to be dead, man. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7893.76s)]
*  Literally his tits [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7895.76s)]
*  kind of turned me on. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7897.76s)]
*  They're so much closer to women's breasts [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7899.76s)]
*  than they are jacked pecs. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7901.76s)]
*  What's crazy is he's probably really weak [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7903.76s)]
*  because of all that stuff too. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7905.76s)]
*  It probably inhibits his ability to [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7907.76s)]
*  move things around. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7909.76s)]
*  He's probably weak as fuck while being gigantic. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7911.76s)]
*  Who's attracted to that? [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7913.76s)]
*  Who's into that guy? [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7915.76s)]
*  He's clearly insane. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7917.76s)]
*  That's an insane person. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7919.76s)]
*  Oh no! [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7921.76s)]
*  What are you doing to your arms, bro? [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7923.76s)]
*  Dude, poke that thing. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7925.76s)]
*  The veins are so weird. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7927.76s)]
*  That's so crazy that he's done that to his arms. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7929.76s)]
*  Oh no! [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7931.76s)]

*  Go scroll up a little. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7937.76s)]
*  That's okay. Look at this guy. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7939.76s)]
*  That's so insane. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7941.76s)]
*  What is the page called? [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7943.76s)]
*  Body Stronger Brazil. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7945.76s)]
*  That guy's got titties. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7947.76s)]
*  That dude grew breasts. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7949.76s)]
*  Nipple pump it says. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7951.76s)]
*  Nipple pump? [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7953.76s)]
*  He used a nipple pump? [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7955.76s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7957.76s)]
*  That's probably [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7959.76s)]
*  Gano Mastica. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7961.76s)]

*  Don't do that. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7971.76s)]
*  I'm listening. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7973.76s)]
*  That's the closest one. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7975.76s)]
*  Take it down to eight. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7977.76s)]
*  You got a little [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7979.76s)]
*  overzealous at the end. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7981.76s)]

*  plastic surgery. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7993.76s)]
*  If you think you can change it, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7995.76s)]
*  and then you do change it, then you want to change it a little more better. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7997.76s)]
*  I don't like this about me. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=7999.76s)]
*  You go down the rabbit hole just like anything else. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8001.76s)]
*  I don't like this weird piece of skin. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8003.76s)]
*  I don't like the way my nose meets my eyebrows. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8005.76s)]

*  Remember that cat lady? [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8011.76s)]
*  Who looked like what? Beauty and the Beast? [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8013.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8015.76s)]
*  The hellboy in Beauty and the Beast. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8017.76s)]
*  It's a perfect example of someone who [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8019.76s)]

*  These are puffy. Can we do something about this? [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8051.76s)]
*  Maybe I'm going to have my cheeks stick out more [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8053.76s)]

*  started with the Opie and Anthony show. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8713.76s)]
*  It started with the Opie and Anthony show. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8715.76s)]
*  They had comics on, they would hang. And we'd all just talk shit [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8717.76s)]
*  to each other and it was so much fun. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8719.76s)]
*  And you always look forward to it. It was the only morning show [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8721.76s)]
*  that I would like legitimately always look forward to. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8723.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, because that's in the era where every morning show [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8725.76s)]
*  I mean thank God I came up in [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8727.76s)]
*  like I've only done two morning shows as a headliner. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8729.76s)]
*  Oh you got lucky. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8731.76s)]
*  But some of them were a lot of fun man. There was a bunch [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8733.76s)]
*  that I used to really enjoy doing. Guys in Philly [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8735.76s)]
*  and Arizona and Seattle. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8737.76s)]
*  There was a bunch that were really fun. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8739.76s)]
*  But you know some of them were dry. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8741.76s)]
*  And some of them, the DJ was kind of douchey. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8743.76s)]
*  And some of them they were really cool. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8745.76s)]
*  Because they're these little kings of their own little domain. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8747.76s)]
*  And they hate when someone actually [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8749.76s)]
*  is funnier than them. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8751.76s)]
*  It's also like you're the most renegade of all [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8753.76s)]
*  art forms. You just went to bed [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8755.76s)]
*  an hour ago. You smell like tequila. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8757.76s)]
*  You've got glitter on your face [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8759.76s)]
*  for some reason. And you're sitting [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8761.76s)]
*  there talking shit. And you're [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8763.76s)]
*  entertaining and you're having fun. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8765.76s)]
*  You know and some guys bring the [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8767.76s)]
*  people in like Bert Kreischer. He'll get everybody [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8769.76s)]
*  drunk with him. And he'll bring the party [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8771.76s)]
*  to those things. He's really good at [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8773.76s)]
*  he was really, always really, I don't think he does morning shows anymore. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8775.76s)]
*  I probably doesn't have to. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8777.76s)]
*  But he might do them if he's doing it for a friend. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8779.76s)]
*  He's also the kind of lunatic [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8781.76s)]
*  that likes doing shit like that. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8783.76s)]
*  He would do it for a friend. Guys that he knows from [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8785.76s)]
*  back in the day. But the point is like [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8787.76s)]
*  After he's been drunk all night. I remember I was in Tampa [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8789.76s)]
*  and I was opening for Bobby. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8791.76s)]
*  And he brought me in to do [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8793.76s)]
*  morning radio with him. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8795.76s)]
*  And [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8797.76s)]
*  Bert was also, we were at SideSplitters [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8799.76s)]
*  and Bert was at the Improv or whatever. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8801.76s)]
*  And Bert was like getting fucked up [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8803.76s)]
*  and he was about to run a fucking marathon [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8805.76s)]
*  that day or something. And I was like [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8807.76s)]
*  what? And I, I, we, me and Bobby [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8809.76s)]
*  had driven through the night so we only had like a few [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8811.76s)]
*  hours of sleep. And I was like I feel [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8813.76s)]
*  like a bus hit me. I'm you know [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8815.76s)]
*  however much younger than this guy. And [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8817.76s)]
*  he's just getting fucked up at 6am. He's gonna go [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8819.76s)]
*  run a, he's gonna go do two shows and run a marathon. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8821.76s)]
*  Well as much as Bert drinks he's always consistently [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8823.76s)]
*  worked out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that makes [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8825.76s)]
*  a big difference because like when we did this [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8827.76s)]
*  Sober October Fitness Challenge a few years ago [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8829.76s)]
*  he put in real fucking numbers every day. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8831.76s)]
*  Yeah. Cause we all had to wear a chest [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8833.76s)]
*  strap. Right, right, right. To read how much [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8835.76s)]
*  exercise he's done. He put in real [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8837.76s)]
*  numbers every day. So the dude even though [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8839.76s)]
*  he would hammer the booze, he also [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8841.76s)]
*  works out. And like that's [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8843.76s)]
*  his strategy. His strategy is to keep his [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8845.76s)]
*  body healthy so he can drink. That makes sense. Respect. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8847.76s)]
*  Respect man. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8849.76s)]
*  It's, I mean obviously it's [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8851.76s)]
*  work. Yeah. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8853.76s)]
*  How do you not love the guy? He's one of the best [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8855.76s)]
*  people ever. He's such a character. He's a great hang. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8857.76s)]
*  Yeah, he's such a character. Yeah. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8859.76s)]
*  But no, you're right. It is like, it is just like [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8861.76s)]
*  a, a pod is fun. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8863.76s)]
*  That's what I realized. And the last [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8865.76s)]
*  part of it was super fun and this one that I'm doing now [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8867.76s)]
*  I just started [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8869.76s)]
*  at Stavi's World. I had Sam [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8871.76s)]
*  Morell actually, he was my first guest. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8873.76s)]
*  So it's like fun. It's like I'm doing like a... Why did you stop? [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8875.76s)]
*  The last one? Yeah. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8877.76s)]
*  I was a dude, I was a little burned out. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8879.76s)]
*  It was at the end of that tour like we were talking about [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8881.76s)]
*  where I was just like, I gained a lot of weight. I was, I [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8883.76s)]
*  had overworked myself because coming out of the pandemic [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8885.76s)]
*  I tried to make up [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8887.76s)]
*  for a whole year off by just never [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8889.76s)]
*  getting off the road. Right. And it's just like [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8891.76s)]
*  it was little shit. It's like, you know [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8893.76s)]
*  I was like, I just want to focus [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8895.76s)]
*  on stand up and I just want [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8897.76s)]
*  to like, you know, and I think [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8899.76s)]
*  at a certain point we had kind of creatively [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8901.76s)]
*  had gotten a little stale and we were [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8903.76s)]
*  all just like, I don't know [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8905.76s)]
*  let's, kind of like I was feeling like maybe [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8907.76s)]
*  there's another thing I want to pour all my energy [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8909.76s)]
*  into stand up. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8911.76s)]
*  And it was [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8913.76s)]
*  just like, dude I kind of just [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8915.76s)]
*  stopped everything. I took a little break and [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8917.76s)]
*  I put the special out [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8919.76s)]
*  and I thought I was just going to have it eat. I was just going to take it easy. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8921.76s)]
*  I thought it was like, alright [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8923.76s)]
*  I'm just going to regroup, I'll take some time [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8925.76s)]
*  off, start building the next special [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8927.76s)]
*  slowly. And then I was just like [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8929.76s)]
*  fucking YouTube and Tiktok [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8931.76s)]
*  and all this shit as much as we shit on it. Like that [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8933.76s)]
*  shit jumped my career up where I was like [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8935.76s)]
*  fuck I can't really take a break now. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8937.76s)]
*  Because like, I'm selling tickets like I never [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8939.76s)]
*  have sold before. And it was just [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8941.76s)]
*  kind of the thing where I was planning on just [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8943.76s)]
*  taking a lot of time off. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8945.76s)]
*  How long are you going to take off? [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8947.76s)]
*  I was just going to focus on stand up and try and get healthier. Kind of like that [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8949.76s)]
*  year that I was dreaming about [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8951.76s)]
*  and it was like, like the summer that I spent with [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8953.76s)]
*  my brother, I thought it was going to be three months. It ended up [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8955.76s)]
*  being like four weeks. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8957.76s)]
*  Well here's one thing you can do. You can hold [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8959.76s)]
*  yourself accountable by talking about it [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8961.76s)]
*  publicly. That's true. On your podcast. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8963.76s)]
*  That's true. And when you do something like that [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8965.76s)]
*  it's one of the things that I find whenever we do these Sober [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8967.76s)]
*  October things. We tell everybody what we have to do [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8969.76s)]
*  every day. Yeah. And then we're held accountable. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8971.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah and then like [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8973.76s)]
*  you say you have a goal and you work towards that goal [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8975.76s)]
*  and people get to see it. And then they can become invested in it. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8977.76s)]
*  And they root for you. That's true. And so [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8979.76s)]
*  I feel like for podcasts, for comics [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8981.76s)]
*  in this day and age, I feel [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8983.76s)]
*  like it's just as important as social [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8985.76s)]
*  media. If not more important. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8987.76s)]
*  To have a podcast, it's like [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8989.76s)]
*  even if you only like talk about [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8991.76s)]
*  shit that you think about [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8993.76s)]
*  in the news. Like something wacky goes down. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8995.76s)]
*  You know, Kanye West says he loves Hitler [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8997.76s)]
*  or you know. Right. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=8999.76s)]
*  Something happens. It's hilarious to see somebody make Alex Jones [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9001.76s)]
*  uncomfortable. Yeah. Some wild shit [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9003.76s)]
*  goes down in the world that you didn't expect [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9005.76s)]
*  and you could talk about it. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9007.76s)]
*  And you know, just [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9009.76s)]
*  do it on a regular basis and [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9011.76s)]
*  people enjoy it. And it doesn't have to be long [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9013.76s)]
*  and it doesn't have to have guests. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9015.76s)]
*  In fact, Bill Burr, one of my [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9017.76s)]
*  favorite podcasts ever, no guest. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9019.76s)]
*  Tim Dillon, one of my favorite ever. Very [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9021.76s)]
*  rarely does he have a guest on. Yeah. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9023.76s)]
*  Most of the time it's just him and his [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9025.76s)]
*  producer. And you [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9027.76s)]
*  you develop a style [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9029.76s)]
*  of talking shit that is very [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9031.76s)]
*  entertaining. For sure. And it helps [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9033.76s)]
*  your writing. I know it helps Tim's [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9035.76s)]
*  and Bill says it helps his too [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9037.76s)]
*  because you're constantly ranting about [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9039.76s)]
*  stuff. And every now and then you can take those rants, [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9041.76s)]
*  extract them, and [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9043.76s)]
*  especially Dillon, because Dillon is essentially doing [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9045.76s)]
*  a one audience member show. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9047.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. It's wild. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9049.76s)]
*  It's massively improved his standup. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9051.76s)]
*  But also improved the amount [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9053.76s)]
*  of people that are coming to see him because of the podcast. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9055.76s)]
*  It's like all these things work [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9057.76s)]
*  in synergy and everybody wants to [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9059.76s)]
*  get on a show, right? Get on a show, it's great. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9061.76s)]
*  Get a pay charge. You could do that yourself. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9063.76s)]
*  I think that's over. No, I really think [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9065.76s)]
*  like YouTube [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9067.76s)]
*  and podcasts are so much, like I [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9069.76s)]
*  have friends who are on TV and it does not really change [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9071.76s)]
*  your life. Well, you become [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9073.76s)]
*  a part of a system, right? And you [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9075.76s)]
*  have to work on this thing that the system [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9077.76s)]
*  is creating and your [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9079.76s)]
*  other stuff is all on the side now. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9081.76s)]
*  And it's not as lucrative as it used to be. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9083.76s)]
*  It used to be, it made sense because it's like [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9085.76s)]
*  yeah, you get that fucking [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9087.76s)]
*  check, you're good. Well, it used to be [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9089.76s)]
*  if you became the person [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9091.76s)]
*  who the sitcom was named after, like [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9093.76s)]
*  Roseanne or Seinfeld. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9095.76s)]
*  That's the fucking [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9097.76s)]
*  top of the mountain. Yeah, yeah, that's [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9099.76s)]
*  true. Then you're set for life. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9101.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think what I like doing [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9103.76s)]
*  on this one, so it's stop, [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9105.76s)]
*  it came out of like, I was doing [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9107.76s)]
*  an advice show over the pandemic because [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9109.76s)]
*  I wanted, I didn't feel like [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9111.76s)]
*  I was near an audience. So I did it on Twitch [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9113.76s)]
*  so it was live and people would call in [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9115.76s)]
*  and I wouldn't screen, I wouldn't screen the calls. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9117.76s)]
*  I had a producer. And so I would just respond [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9119.76s)]
*  to whatever questions people were asking off the top [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9121.76s)]
*  of my head. And it was like, I got [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9123.76s)]
*  to kind of experience [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9125.76s)]
*  a live show. I got to kind of do crowd work [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9127.76s)]
*  and there's, you know, 600 people watching [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9129.76s)]
*  on Twitch and it felt kind of nice. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9131.76s)]
*  And then I realized I kind of liked it. Like I [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9133.76s)]
*  liked the advice part [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9135.76s)]
*  of it. I liked kind of, you know, sharing [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9137.76s)]
*  my perspective with people. And then I would interview my [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9139.76s)]
*  friends. You know, comedians are all fucking, [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9141.76s)]
*  they have some kind of mental illness, [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9143.76s)]
*  some kind of hang up something. So it's always [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9145.76s)]

*  strictly stand up, but it's funny. You do anything [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9287.76s)]
*  you want, man. It's pretty fun. If you're into [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9289.76s)]
*  fucking baseball cards, you can do a thing on baseball. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9291.76s)]
*  It doesn't matter. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do whatever the [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9293.76s)]
*  fuck you want. That's the thing about the world [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9295.76s)]
*  that we're living in now. There's so much more [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9297.76s)]
*  freedom of expression. Even though people [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9299.76s)]
*  are trying to clamp down on it and everyone's talking about [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9301.76s)]
*  censorship. And there's a lot of that too. But that's just [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9303.76s)]
*  seems to be a part of the [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9305.76s)]
*  natural human [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9307.76s)]
*  experience. Like when [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9309.76s)]
*  people get into positions of power, [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9311.76s)]
*  they want to silence opposing voices. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9313.76s)]
*  Those voices bother them. Doesn't matter [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9315.76s)]
*  if it's Republicans or Democrats. People [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9317.76s)]
*  constantly do it. And they always want to blame [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9319.76s)]
*  the left is always censoring [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9321.76s)]
*  and then the right is always... Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9323.76s)]
*  But it seems like it's a [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9325.76s)]
*  fucking normal human thing to do. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9327.76s)]
*  And the internet is like one of the rare [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9329.76s)]
*  times ever where like a break [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9331.76s)]
*  in the dam. Yeah. And just [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9333.76s)]
*  whee! Well, that's right. I do think [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9335.76s)]
*  that's true where it's like you can [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9337.76s)]
*  like, you can fucking find [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9339.76s)]
*  your... Even if there's someone [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9341.76s)]
*  who's trying to quote cancel you or whatever. It's like [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9343.76s)]
*  look at Shane or look at whatever. It's like [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9345.76s)]
*  you can figure it out. A lot of people like [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9347.76s)]
*  have a career despite [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9349.76s)]
*  those attempts or whatever. And it's like [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9351.76s)]
*  I've said some fucked up shit as a joke. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9353.76s)]
*  Maybe some people try and cancel me. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9355.76s)]
*  But it's like I'm trying to build my own audience. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9357.76s)]
*  And I'm trying to just like... You know... [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9359.76s)]
*  You're also doing comedy live, right? [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9361.76s)]
*  And if you're talking shit, [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9363.76s)]
*  you take chances. And sometimes you don't even [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9365.76s)]
*  realize what you're saying while you're saying it. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9367.76s)]
*  You're trying to be funny. Yeah. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9369.76s)]
*  Patrice had a great [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9371.76s)]
*  line about that. It's like a joke that bombs [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9373.76s)]
*  and a joke that kills all comes from [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9375.76s)]
*  the same place. Right. Interesting. The person [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9377.76s)]
*  is just trying to be funny. Yeah, that's true. That's true. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9379.76s)]
*  It's the intention of it. The intention [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9381.76s)]
*  is never to hurt someone. And you do [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9383.76s)]
*  have to like, you know, you have [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9385.76s)]
*  to... What did Chris Roxway say? [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9387.76s)]
*  There's been racist versions [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9389.76s)]
*  of all his jokes or something like that when he was [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9391.76s)]
*  figuring them out. Well, Chris, [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9393.76s)]
*  that one bit that became one [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9395.76s)]
*  of his best bits ever. That [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9397.76s)]
*  I love black people, but I hate [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9399.76s)]
*  N-word. Sure, sure. That bit is a fantastic [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9401.76s)]
*  bit. And apparently, like [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9403.76s)]
*  he struggled with that bit for a long time before [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9405.76s)]
*  he got it to work. Right, right, right. Because sometimes [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9407.76s)]
*  when you have a complicated idea [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9409.76s)]
*  in your head, of course, you're like, how do I [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9411.76s)]
*  get this fucking thing to work? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9413.76s)]
*  can almost bail on it and then it becomes [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9415.76s)]
*  like your closing bit. Louie said something [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9417.76s)]
*  where he had like the joke about [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9419.76s)]
*  molesting [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9421.76s)]
*  children. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9423.76s)]
*  People would like survive [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9425.76s)]
*  if they didn't... [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9427.76s)]
*  Or more children would survive if like [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9429.76s)]
*  we're so mean to [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9431.76s)]
*  child molesters. Which is like... [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9433.76s)]
*  It's like an interesting... [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9435.76s)]
*  Even saying that, I'm like, god damn. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9437.76s)]
*  But it would have been interesting to see, you know, [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9439.76s)]
*  where the bit went, I [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9441.76s)]
*  suppose. But yeah, I do think like [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9443.76s)]
*  I do think there's a freedom to do whatever you want. But didn't that bit make it [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9445.76s)]
*  on a special? [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9447.76s)]
*  I'm not sure. I think that bit might have made it on a [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9449.76s)]
*  special. I don't... I just remember [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9451.76s)]
*  talking about it back in the day. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9453.76s)]
*  Yeah. I think he might [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9455.76s)]
*  have actually figured out a way to make that work. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9457.76s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9459.76s)]
*  But he could do that. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9461.76s)]
*  That's what he likes to do too. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9463.76s)]
*  Yeah, I do think that like [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9465.76s)]
*  you should have that, Louie, but I also think like [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9467.76s)]
*  sometimes it is [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9469.76s)]
*  like, I do think like [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9471.76s)]
*  you should be able to say whatever you want, but it's also like [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9473.76s)]
*  using nuclear weapons where it's like, yeah, Chris [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9475.76s)]
*  Rock can do it. But not every [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9477.76s)]
*  fucking open mic'er can do it. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9479.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like that's what it is about. But how do they learn how to do it? [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9481.76s)]
*  They learn how to do it by stumbling. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9483.76s)]
*  They learn how to do it by trying. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9485.76s)]
*  But with easier stuff. And falling flat on their face. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9487.76s)]
*  But they don't know that while they're doing it. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9489.76s)]
*  You wouldn't spar with [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9491.76s)]
*  BJ Penn to learn. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9493.76s)]
*  But here's the thing, you might [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9495.76s)]
*  have to. If you're in a jujitsu class. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9497.76s)]
*  The point is, if you're a comic, but if you're a comic [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9499.76s)]
*  and you're on stage, you don't know what the fuck [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9501.76s)]
*  you're doing. You don't have a coach. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9503.76s)]
*  You don't have a trainer. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9505.76s)]
*  No one's showing you how to do it. And if you're a dumb [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9507.76s)]
*  kid, you're 21 years old, and you have this [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9509.76s)]
*  complicated idea in your head, you think you're going to [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9511.76s)]
*  figure out how to make funny in front of these people. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9513.76s)]
*  But you fall flat on your face. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9515.76s)]
*  You should still try it. That's how you learn. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9517.76s)]
*  You learn by fucking up. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9519.76s)]
*  Yeah, I would say keep it to like [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9521.76s)]
*  but you do have this epidemic of like [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9523.76s)]
*  young kids who think they're ready. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9525.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. For the big shit. And it's like you're not bro. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9527.76s)]
*  You didn't feel like that when you were young? [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9529.76s)]
*  You talked about how you did. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9531.76s)]
*  I guess that's true, but I guess I didn't drop [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9533.76s)]
*  any N-bombs. I'll put it that way. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9535.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? That's what I did. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9537.76s)]
*  But I was talking about wiping my own ass and you know [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9539.76s)]
*  how little my... Still the same ideas. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9541.76s)]
*  But everybody's delusional about their ability. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9543.76s)]
*  Yes, for sure. And for young [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9545.76s)]
*  guys coming up, you have all this [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9547.76s)]
*  testosterone and fucking [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9549.76s)]
*  zero clue on how the [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9551.76s)]
*  world works yet. And you start making a living [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9553.76s)]
*  doing comedy or you start doing open mics [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9555.76s)]
*  and getting laughs. And you think you're profound. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9557.76s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9559.76s)]
*  There's a lot of people that pretend [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9561.76s)]
*  to be profound on [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9563.76s)]
*  stage. One of the worst things in the world. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9565.76s)]
*  One of the most painful things. I just in general [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9567.76s)]
*  don't like making a point. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9569.76s)]
*  I like telling a funny story. It's more fun [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9571.76s)]
*  to not make a point. And a lot of people [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9573.76s)]
*  love that. You know, we talked about it the other [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9575.76s)]
*  day about Bill Hicks. Bill Hicks [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9577.76s)]
*  was such a revolutionary [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9579.76s)]
*  comedian because all he had was points. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9581.76s)]
*  Like everything was intense points. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9583.76s)]
*  But it fucked a lot of people up because a lot of [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9585.76s)]
*  young dorks imitated him. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9587.76s)]
*  I definitely probably [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9589.76s)]
*  did. I definitely had some... Pontificating [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9591.76s)]
*  Joe. I definitely had some nonsense [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9593.76s)]
*  that I fucking tried. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9595.76s)]
*  Because when I first saw him I was 21. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9597.76s)]
*  I was like super impressionable. I was an open micer. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9599.76s)]
*  There was a bunch of those guys [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9601.76s)]
*  that you'd see and you'd found yourself [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9603.76s)]
*  sounding like them. Absolutely. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9605.76s)]
*  Like Patrice would call them babies. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9607.76s)]
*  He's like, Patrice's got so many babies. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9609.76s)]
*  Oh, Patrice for generations. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9611.76s)]
*  Generations had babies. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9613.76s)]
*  Robin Harris had a lot of babies. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9615.76s)]
*  There was a lot of people that imitated Robin [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9617.76s)]
*  Harris when he was at the top in LA. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9619.76s)]
*  Back in the 90s. There's a bunch of those guys [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9621.76s)]
*  that are like super influential, [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9623.76s)]
*  very charismatic people. And everybody just [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9625.76s)]
*  Brody Stevens. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9627.76s)]
*  People would talk like Brody. A lot of people [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9629.76s)]
*  were doing Canane in Brooklyn when I was [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9631.76s)]
*  coming up. There's a lot of Cananes going on. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9633.76s)]
*  A lot of [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9635.76s)]
*  there's a lot of people that did Stan Hope. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9637.76s)]
*  Stan Hope. Oh, without question. A lot of people did Stan Hope. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9639.76s)]
*  Yeah. I mean there was times where I was just [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9641.76s)]
*  like I couldn't, there were some comedians that I didn't [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9643.76s)]
*  want to watch because I didn't want to like [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9645.76s)]
*  like Sean Patton's a great example of somebody. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9647.76s)]
*  He's got a special out. Everybody should go see it on Peacock. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9649.76s)]
*  But like I was just like I [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9651.76s)]
*  loved Sean and I wanted to get to how [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9653.76s)]
*  free he is on stage. But I was [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9655.76s)]
*  just like at a certain point I was like I don't think I [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9657.76s)]
*  can watch him because I'll just steal his [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9659.76s)]
*  swag. You know what I mean? Like you [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9661.76s)]
*  steal his like fun, like his energy. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9663.76s)]
*  And that's another thing with Stan Hope is like [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9665.76s)]
*  energies is part of it. Like vibe [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9667.76s)]
*  is part of it. You know? Yep. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9669.76s)]
*  And so I don't know. I try and just do my own. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9671.76s)]
*  Vibe is definitely part of it. There's a lot [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9673.76s)]
*  going on up there man. I always say it's [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9675.76s)]
*  kind of like a mass hypnosis. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9677.76s)]
*  It's like everybody, like if a great comic's [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9679.76s)]
*  on stage, if you're on stage and you're killing, [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9681.76s)]
*  I'm letting you think for me. Right. True. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9683.76s)]
*  I'm just sitting here like this and you're telling me these stories and all [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9685.76s)]
*  I'm doing is like letting you [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9687.76s)]
*  think for me. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9689.76s)]
*  You're telling me, I'm listening to what [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9691.76s)]
*  you're saying. I'm getting the picture. Yeah. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9693.76s)]
*  I'm just going along on this ride. Yeah. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9695.76s)]
*  And when someone can do that to a large [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9697.76s)]
*  group of people, it's very similar to a kind [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9699.76s)]
*  of hypnosis. It's a laughter hypnosis. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9701.76s)]
*  Yeah, no, absolutely. It's like [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9703.76s)]
*  and what's [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9705.76s)]
*  beautiful about it too is that like [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9707.76s)]
*  it's not, every show [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9709.76s)]
*  is different. That's what I love. Like a couple [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9711.76s)]
*  things that you were talking about earlier where it's like [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9713.76s)]
*  you are basically self-taught. You can't really [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9715.76s)]
*  you can take a class but it's not really [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9717.76s)]
*  No one teaches it like you. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9719.76s)]
*  Yeah. Like you know, Kurt Mesker's not [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9721.76s)]
*  going to teach a class, you know. Of course. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9723.76s)]
*  Mark Norman's not going to teach a class. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9725.76s)]
*  Right, right, right, right. That's a great point. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9727.76s)]
*  The people that teach classes aren't usually people that did [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9729.76s)]
*  so good at it in the first place. Exactly. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9731.76s)]
*  It's like you want to, it's like they teach you to take [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9733.76s)]
*  the mic out of the stand and put the [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9735.76s)]
*  mic away. But it's like you really just have [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9737.76s)]
*  to, there is no solution other than [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9739.76s)]
*  get on stage as much as possible. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9741.76s)]
*  You can get some advice from your peers. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9743.76s)]
*  That's helped me a lot. Advice from my [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9745.76s)]
*  peers has helped me a lot. But no one can tell you how to [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9747.76s)]
*  do it because the way you do it is different [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9749.76s)]
*  in the way Ari does it, is different the way Shane does it. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9751.76s)]
*  You got to kind of do it with your vibe. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9753.76s)]
*  And the other thing I really [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9755.76s)]
*  love is that fucking every [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9757.76s)]
*  show is different. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9759.76s)]
*  You'll never be in that room, [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9761.76s)]
*  those people will never be in the same room [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9763.76s)]
*  ever again. And that shit rocks. I love [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9765.76s)]
*  that. And if people have their phones in those yonder [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9767.76s)]
*  bags, man, they're in the moment. They're really [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9769.76s)]
*  there. I really like, yeah, [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9771.76s)]
*  ComedyWorks, great club. They do that. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9773.76s)]
*  It's so good to do, man. Every club should [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9775.76s)]
*  do it. It changes the vibe of [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9777.76s)]
*  the show. You're right, people are way more present. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9779.76s)]
*  They're way more present. They're not distracted [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9781.76s)]
*  at all by their phones. And the comic's [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9783.76s)]
*  more free because you can fuck around on stage more. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9785.76s)]
*  The whole thing is [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9787.76s)]
*  better. We're living in a [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9789.76s)]
*  strange time for comedy, but it's a really good [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9791.76s)]
*  time. There's so many good comics coming up. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9793.76s)]
*  I think it's like a golden [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9795.76s)]
*  era for up and coming talent. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9797.76s)]
*  I don't even think it's a big deal. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9799.76s)]
*  Maybe there's a philosophical [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9801.76s)]
*  difference. I don't even think it's a big deal to be a [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9803.76s)]
*  little restrained in what [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9805.76s)]
*  I do. I think it's a [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9807.76s)]
*  challenge. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9809.76s)]
*  Because I think you can become funny around [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9811.76s)]
*  societal constraints a little bit. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9813.76s)]
*  It's a challenge for sure. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9815.76s)]
*  Jerry Steinfeld used to say that about being clean. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9817.76s)]
*  That it is a challenge to make a really funny joke [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9819.76s)]
*  clean. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9821.76s)]
*  Whereas a lot of people, especially back then, [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9823.76s)]
*  they felt like swearing [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9825.76s)]
*  was somehow or another cheap. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9827.76s)]
*  It was a cop out. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9829.76s)]
*  Which is interesting. I subscribed to that [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9831.76s)]
*  philosophy because that's how I grew up. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9833.76s)]
*  I was in a club where I thought I was a loser [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9835.76s)]
*  because I liked Dice Clay and Sam Kinnison. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9837.76s)]
*  I liked Richard Pryor. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9839.76s)]
*  I liked these guys who swore all the time. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9841.76s)]
*  But there's a value to learning [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9843.76s)]
*  how to construct a joke without [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9845.76s)]
*  swears. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9847.76s)]
*  When you fully express yourself where you normally [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9849.76s)]
*  would with swears, it's better. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9851.76s)]
*  Because the joke stands by itself. We watched [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9853.76s)]
*  Kinnison do his first Letterman the other day. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9855.76s)]
*  We did a Protect Our Parks. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9857.76s)]
*  When we were watching it, we were like, [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9859.76s)]
*  look how good this guy is and there's no swears. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9861.76s)]
*  He's doing Letterman. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9863.76s)]
*  That's an energy guy. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9865.76s)]
*  Where you're like, fuck dude, this rules. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9867.76s)]
*  He was from another planet. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9869.76s)]
*  That guy, when he first came around, [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9871.76s)]
*  he changed comedy. He was the first guy that I ever [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9873.76s)]
*  saw do comedy where I was like, maybe I could [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9875.76s)]
*  do comedy. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9877.76s)]
*  I thought comedy was like these guys [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9879.76s)]
*  that rolled up sleeves, [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9881.76s)]
*  which is where I dressed like that when I first started. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9883.76s)]
*  I thought you were going to dress like that. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9885.76s)]
*  Had a blazer on and shit, a funny t-shirt. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9887.76s)]
*  I was such a dork. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9889.76s)]
*  A little Twink Joe in the blazer. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9891.76s)]
*  A little cutie pie. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9893.76s)]
*  I was trying to imitate [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9895.76s)]
*  what a comedian was. I saw Kinnison [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9897.76s)]
*  and it made me think, maybe [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9899.76s)]
*  there's other ways [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9901.76s)]
*  to do this. Then I saw [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9903.76s)]
*  Dennis Leary and I saw Hicks [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9905.76s)]
*  and I saw a lot of these guys. Comedy is [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9907.76s)]
*  a lot of things. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9909.76s)]
*  You get a confused idea of what [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9911.76s)]
*  comedy is. Luckily, I started out [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9913.76s)]
*  in Boston and all of those [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9915.76s)]
*  guys I talked about, Lenny Clark and Don [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9917.76s)]
*  Gavin, they were all coke snorting, [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9919.76s)]
*  big giant guys [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9921.76s)]
*  who got in bar room brawls. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9923.76s)]
*  Oh, this is comedy too. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9925.76s)]
*  Well, Boston had a very [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9927.76s)]
*  I was definitely a little fucking comedy nerd. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9929.76s)]
*  It was one of the [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9931.76s)]
*  places that early had a very defined [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9933.76s)]
*  local scene with a lot of really [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9935.76s)]
*  good talent. You see [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9937.76s)]
*  who comes out of there from that [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9939.76s)]
*  era. To this day, [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9941.76s)]
*  I've seen people kill harder in Boston [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9943.76s)]
*  at these local clubs, these local guys [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9945.76s)]
*  like Steve Sweeney. No one's [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9947.76s)]
*  killed harder. They've killed [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9949.76s)]
*  as hard as you can kill. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9951.76s)]
*  You get just as good [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9953.76s)]
*  and I've seen guys do just as good. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9955.76s)]
*  They killed so [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9957.76s)]
*  hard. Kevin Meaney, he's another guy [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9959.76s)]
*  from Boston. I saw him watch a [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9961.76s)]
*  Casual Rising Star with my friend from high school. We went and [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9963.76s)]
*  sat there. I couldn't [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9965.76s)]
*  believe how funny it was. It didn't make sense [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9967.76s)]
*  to me. I didn't understand. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9969.76s)]
*  He would do [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9971.76s)]
*  this thing about big pants people. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9973.76s)]
*  That's not right. We're big pants people. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9975.76s)]
*  He was so [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9977.76s)]
*  comfortable and so [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9979.76s)]
*  in the groove. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9981.76s)]
*  It was so funny. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9983.76s)]
*  It was perplexing. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9985.76s)]
*  I remember me and my friend Diane, we left there. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9987.76s)]
*  We were like, how was he so funny? [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9989.76s)]
*  How was someone so funny? [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9991.76s)]
*  For an hour and fifteen minutes, he just [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9993.76s)]
*  destroyed. Yeah, it's incredible. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9995.76s)]
*  I'm trying to like [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9997.76s)]
*  and you try, it's nice [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=9999.76s)]
*  because you get to just chase that. You're like, [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10001.76s)]
*  I gotta get that funny. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10003.76s)]
*  You just gotta get better every time. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10005.76s)]
*  Just keep trying to get better and then [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10007.76s)]
*  you're on a path and then you'll look back. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10009.76s)]
*  Dom Iarara said it to me once. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10011.76s)]
*  He goes, the beautiful thing about comedy is you can [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10013.76s)]
*  just keep getting better if you keep working on it. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10015.76s)]
*  It's not like a baseball player where your knees go. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10017.76s)]
*  You can keep doing it. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10019.76s)]
*  You can keep getting better. He's like, I'm so happy. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10021.76s)]
*  Dom was in his late 60s [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10023.76s)]
*  when he was telling me this. I'm so happy I'm a comic. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10025.76s)]
*  You see that with the tell because [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10027.76s)]
*  he's the fucking man. Better than ever. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10029.76s)]
*  He's better than ever. He's a monster. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10031.76s)]
*  And I do think sometimes it can be hard [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10033.76s)]
*  as you advance to continue to [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10035.76s)]
*  stay better because [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10037.76s)]
*  he has the [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10039.76s)]
*  discipline to like [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10041.76s)]
*  he treats it like, dude, I open [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10043.76s)]
*  for him and like [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10045.76s)]
*  he, if something [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10047.76s)]
*  if he missed a little thing, you could tell he fucking [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10049.76s)]
*  hated it. If he wasn't doing [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10051.76s)]
*  a hundred out of a hundred, it was [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10053.76s)]
*  like a fucking problem. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10055.76s)]
*  But he does the other thing. It's like [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10057.76s)]
*  he thinks he messed something up in his mind. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10059.76s)]
*  He didn't. It was fucking great. He's the fucking [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10061.76s)]
*  man. And you just see him [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10063.76s)]
*  work on his shit day after day. [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10065.76s)]
*  The biggest thrill for me when I moved to New York was [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10067.76s)]
*  being on a show with fucking Dave Vettel. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10069.76s)]
*  When I'm at the stand and it's the late show and he's [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10071.76s)]
*  coming in. You just see this guy. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10073.76s)]
*  He's working on something. He's [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10075.76s)]
*  killing harder. And he's just like he has the discipline [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10077.76s)]
*  to like not let being [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10079.76s)]
*  Dave Vettel go to his head. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10081.76s)]
*  Well, the opposite. It [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10083.76s)]
*  goes the opposite. Like he [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10085.76s)]
*  hates himself because of that. He's his own [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10087.76s)]
*  harshest critic. But that's why [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10089.76s)]
*  he's so good. That's why he's [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10091.76s)]
*  so good because he's so harsh on himself [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10093.76s)]
*  in his delivery and his material. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10095.76s)]
*  Gillis is like that too. Gillis [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10097.76s)]
*  is like, oh, I don't know. I want a phone to do this [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10099.76s)]

*  that are like we were when we were younger [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10111.76s)]
*  when you get delusional, you think you get headline, [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10113.76s)]
*  you have 15 minutes. Those [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10115.76s)]
*  that's not what you're supposed to be. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10117.76s)]
*  For sure. You're supposed to be the opposite. You're supposed to be [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10119.76s)]
*  like, oh, the more you learn, [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10121.76s)]
*  the more terrified you get. For sure. And that's [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10123.76s)]
*  how you become a fucking, you know, an all time [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10125.76s)]
*  great when you have that kind of work ethic. But [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10127.76s)]
*  you know, that's like Yana said that the [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10129.76s)]
*  kumbo where he's like he works hard as fuck and he's [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10131.36s)]
*  the MVP. But I don't know, man. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10133.36s)]
*  I could just be a little, you know, [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10135.36s)]
*  I don't want to work that hard. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10137.36s)]
*  I just want to have a good time also. You don't have to work that [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10139.36s)]

*  you're doing. I want to be like Shaq. Do what you do but keep doing. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10143.36s)]
*  It's not that you have to work that hard. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10145.36s)]
*  Just do it to your level of [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10147.36s)]
*  enjoyment. Like there's a balancing act. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10149.36s)]
*  If you become so obsessed that you spend [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10151.36s)]
*  all your time doing it and then you become this miserable [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10153.36s)]
*  person who's really successful, [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10155.36s)]
*  that's not a success. Because you're [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10157.36s)]
*  unhappy. So there's like a balance. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10159.36s)]
*  Like how much effort do you want to put in [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10161.36s)]
*  versus how much do you want to get out of it? [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10163.36s)]
*  And you've got to figure out what that is to keep you [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10165.36s)]
*  normal. For me, I [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10167.36s)]
*  just do a bunch of other shit too. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10169.36s)]
*  That's how I keep from going nuts. I do [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10171.36s)]
*  other things that I enjoy. That's why [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10173.36s)]
*  podcasts help me. Because I'll do this [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10175.36s)]
*  too. And then I do comedy too. [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10177.36s)]
*  And then I do the UFC too. [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10179.36s)]
*  So in having these [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10181.36s)]
*  different things, I keep my mind occupied [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10183.36s)]
*  in different ways. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10185.36s)]
*  So it doesn't get burnt out. Have you always been like hyper [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10187.36s)]
*  acting? Have you always been doing like five different things? [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10189.36s)]
*  Is that always how you were? Usually I just do [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10191.36s)]
*  one thing. But too [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10193.36s)]
*  crazy. So I realized [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10195.36s)]
*  as I got older, I need other things. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10197.36s)]
*  I can't have just one thing. I'm too crazy. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10199.36s)]
*  It's like directing my crazy [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10201.36s)]
*  and manageable doses. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10203.36s)]
*  Because one thing, like video games, [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10205.36s)]
*  I used to get addicted to Quake. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10207.36s)]
*  And I would play eight hours a day. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10209.36s)]
*  I wouldn't stop. I was addicted. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10211.36s)]
*  It was a real problem. [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10213.36s)]
*  It was a real problem. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10215.36s)]
*  And I get like that with martial arts. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10217.36s)]
*  I get like that with a lot of things. For me, I have to have [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10219.36s)]
*  other stuff. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10221.36s)]
*  So if I have, I could get addicted [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10223.36s)]
*  like that to comedy and that's great. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10225.36s)]
*  But the problem is like mentally [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10227.36s)]
*  when I get addicted to something, I get like super obsessed. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10229.36s)]
*  And it becomes the only thing I want to concentrate on. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10231.36s)]
*  So I'm thinking about it when I'm doing other stuff. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10233.36s)]
*  And I'm talking to people. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10235.36s)]
*  I'm really thinking about comedy. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10237.36s)]
*  Or I'm really thinking about martial arts. Whatever the fuck the thing is at the time. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10239.36s)]
*  So for me, like the balancing act [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10241.36s)]
*  is having multiple interests. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10243.36s)]
*  That's just for me though. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10245.36s)]
*  Everybody's got their own like weird way of managing. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10247.36s)]
*  I definitely get locked into one thing at a time. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10249.36s)]
*  And I have a hard time [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10251.36s)]
*  switching gears. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10253.36s)]
*  So like we're launching the podcast and I was just [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10255.36s)]
*  I hadn't done stand up in a couple weeks. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10257.36s)]
*  And now I'm about to do, you know, we were just trying to get [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10259.36s)]
*  everything figured out and recording some pods. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10261.36s)]
*  Because I also want to take January off so you got to bank some. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10263.36s)]
*  And so I was just in that mode. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10265.36s)]
*  And now it's like, it does take me a while [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10267.36s)]
*  I feel like to shift gears. To like get into like [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10269.36s)]
*  stand up mode. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10271.36s)]
*  Like that's why the tour next year [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10273.36s)]
*  so it starts in February and then we're going to [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10275.36s)]
*  go until May. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10277.36s)]
*  Almost the only thing I'm focusing on is stand up. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10279.36s)]
*  Because I want to [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10281.36s)]
*  record a special at the end of that. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10283.36s)]
*  Okay, that's over. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10285.36s)]
*  Now I can kind of like shift gears [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10287.36s)]
*  and maybe, you know, do a little [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10289.36s)]
*  write a script. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10291.36s)]
*  I mean I want to act, I want to do that shit too. [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10293.36s)]
*  But it's like I definitely, I'm definitely in that mode [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10295.36s)]
*  where I'm like, I'm just addicted to something right now. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10297.36s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10299.36s)]
*  That's awesome too, you're stating it publicly [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10301.36s)]
*  that you work. So then people will be on your side. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10303.36s)]
*  They'll be with you while you're doing this. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10305.36s)]
*  Which is fun. Yeah. Yeah, it's fun. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10307.36s)]
*  It's fun to put that out there. And it also like [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10309.36s)]
*  it holds you accountable. It's very difficult [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10311.36s)]
*  to do things, just decide, well I'm going to do this [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10313.36s)]
*  every day. Because like if you don't [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10315.36s)]
*  have a fucking list of shit [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10317.36s)]
*  that you have to get done. Yeah. [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10319.36s)]
*  It's so easy to blow stuff off. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10321.36s)]
*  And also it's like when your fucking brain is all [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10323.36s)]
*  fucked. I don't know if you feel like you have ADD [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10325.36s)]
*  or whatever, but it's like I definitely [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10327.36s)]

*  chairs, you kind of sit in a fucked up [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10437.36s)]
*  way and like the middle of my back would be tight [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10439.36s)]
*  at the end of a show. Excessive talking. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10441.36s)]
*  For sure I have that. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10443.36s)]
*  Clearly. Yeah. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10445.36s)]
*  Excessive physical movement. A hundred percent [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10447.36s)]
*  I have that. I'm very excessive. So you're a child [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10449.36s)]
*  with ADD, bro. Being unable to wait their [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10451.36s)]
*  turn. No, I'm not that bad at that. I've gotten better [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10453.36s)]
*  at that. But that's what we were talking about earlier. Acting [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10455.36s)]
*  without thinking. A hundred percent. Yeah. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10457.36s)]
*  Interrupting conversations. That's me. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10459.36s)]
*  Little or no sense of danger. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10461.36s)]
*  I'm not so good at that. Yeah. I kind of [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10463.36s)]
*  am good at it, but kind of also not. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10465.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10467.36s)]
*  I'd say I'm medium good. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10469.36s)]
*  Yeah. So I have everything. You got it all. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10471.36s)]
*  Except like two or three things. Yeah, yeah. But I just feel like [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10473.36s)]
*  I can't. So I should be mandated. Like I need the [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10475.36s)]
*  list. Yeah, you probably should. Which should I be on? [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10477.36s)]
*  Forgetful. Okay. Carelessness or [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10479.36s)]
*  lack of attention to detail. Now this is absolutely me. [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10481.36s)]
*  Continuing starting new [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10483.36s)]
*  tech. What was the one? Forgetfulness? [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10485.36s)]
*  Which one do you [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10487.36s)]
*  know? Were you doing that as a bit? [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10489.36s)]
*  You're like, what was that one? Forgetfulness? Oh, is there more of them? [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10491.36s)]
*  This is for adults. This is for adults. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10493.36s)]
*  Oh, this one's for adults. I just kept scrolling down and [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10495.36s)]
*  I had it all. Okay, so carelessness and lack of attention [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10497.36s)]
*  to detail. Not necessarily. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10499.36s)]
*  I pay attention to things [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10501.36s)]
*  that I'm concentrating on. Yeah. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10503.36s)]
*  I'm very detail oriented with actually things [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10505.36s)]
*  I'm trying to do well. But I think that's the flip side. Like I [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10507.36s)]
*  was listening to Brian Coppleman's podcast. [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10509.36s)]
*  He was talking about how [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10511.36s)]
*  ADD can be like a fucking superpower [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10513.36s)]
*  because sometimes you're so locked [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10515.36s)]
*  in. And he was talking about how like when he was [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10517.36s)]
*  writing his first script, [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10519.36s)]
*  it was like he wanted to do [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10521.36s)]
*  it so bad. And sometimes I feel that way too. Where I'm [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10523.36s)]
*  in the fucking zone. Right. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10525.36s)]
*  When I really want to get something done, where I'm writing [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10527.36s)]
*  a script I really care about [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10529.36s)]
*  or I'm working on a joke that I really want to get [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10531.36s)]
*  done. And I feel like [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10533.36s)]
*  when I'm in that zone, I'm like I'm the fucking smartest man alive. [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10535.36s)]
*  I feel like I'm on Limitless. Here's the question. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10537.36s)]
*  Is this really a disease [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10539.36s)]
*  or is it a problem [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10541.36s)]
*  only because human beings [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10543.36s)]
*  are trying to interface with a complex modern [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10545.36s)]
*  society that doesn't match their genetics? [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10547.36s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe. [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10549.36s)]
*  What is it? I mean there's gotta be some [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10551.36s)]
*  benefit to being locked into [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10553.36s)]
*  some things and being distracted by shit you don't give a fuck [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10555.36s)]
*  about. Yeah. Then if you were a [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10557.36s)]
*  hunter that would help you because you would concentrate [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10559.36s)]
*  only on the thing you're trying to do. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10561.36s)]
*  And you would ignore a bunch of other shit that's probably [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10563.36s)]
*  important but in your mind not as interesting. [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10565.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I think like [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10567.36s)]
*  but I also think [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10569.36s)]
*  I also think some people just don't have that [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10571.36s)]
*  though where they can just pay attention to the surroundings. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10573.36s)]
*  Right. Some people are just scattered. And they're just like [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10575.36s)]
*  yeah just being scattered. And ultimately [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10577.36s)]
*  it's like at the end of the day [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10579.36s)]
*  it's like what am I gonna do now? I'm fucking 33. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10581.36s)]
*  I'm not like you know. Yeah but it's helping you [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10583.36s)]
*  with comedy is my point. Probably yeah. [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10585.36s)]
*  Yeah. 100% dude. Listen. That's the [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10587.36s)]
*  thing. Well that's why I think a lot of people who end up [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10589.36s)]
*  in comedy or certain [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10591.36s)]
*  artistic fields or something do have that. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10593.36s)]
*  But that's the thing. Is that really [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10595.36s)]
*  a disease then? Because that's got a [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10597.36s)]
*  great benefit to it. It just seems like a manageable [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10599.36s)]
*  asset. Well it's like you know Bobon [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10601.36s)]
*  Marjanovic has got [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10603.36s)]
*  gigantism or whatever but it is a disease [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10605.36s)]
*  but it still makes him a good center. Andre the Giant. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10607.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? It is but it also [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10609.36s)]
*  could help you out. You know what I mean? [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10611.36s)]
*  Well that's a different thing [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10613.36s)]
*  right? Because I think ADD is like super [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10615.36s)]
*  fucking common. Yeah probably. [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10617.36s)]
*  But is it real? It's more of a [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10619.36s)]
*  personality probably. But is there [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10621.36s)]
*  any debate as to whether or not [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10623.36s)]
*  ADD is actually a disease? [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10625.36s)]
*  I mean are there people out there that say no this [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10627.36s)]
*  is like a natural function of the way some people's [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10629.36s)]
*  brains work? And some people's brains [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10631.36s)]
*  are not designed to focus on tasks [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10633.36s)]
*  they're not interested in. But if they focus on something [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10635.36s)]
*  they are interested in, they can get really good at it. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10637.36s)]
*  But sometimes you don't even do that. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10639.36s)]
*  Yeah but there's a fucking spectrum of dummies [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10641.36s)]
*  and intelligent people that [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10643.36s)]
*  we have to acknowledge. That's a good point. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10645.36s)]
*  We don't have to set standards for every fucking human [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10647.36s)]
*  being regardless of how low their IQ is. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10649.36s)]
*  I'm just saying for average human beings [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10651.36s)]
*  isn't it possible that that's an asset? [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10653.36s)]
*  Is there a debate on that? [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10655.36s)]
*  There probably is. Yeah let's see what they say. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10657.36s)]
*  The ADHD community. Are some people [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10659.36s)]
*  thinking that ADD is not actually a disease? [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10661.36s)]
*  I'm sure plenty. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10663.36s)]
*  I wonder who's right. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10665.36s)]
*  But sometimes I'll take a fucking [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10667.36s)]
*  Adderall or whatever [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10669.36s)]
*  just to, if I have some shit to do and I'm like [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10671.36s)]
*  oh this rocks. Yeah but that's [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10673.36s)]
*  amphetamines, of course it rocks. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10675.36s)]
*  There's a reason why it's so [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10677.36s)]
*  god damn addictive. That's hilarious. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10679.36s)]
*  It's addictive. It rocks. [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10681.36s)]
*  It's not addictive because it sucks. [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10683.36s)]
*  That's a good point. All that stuff [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10685.36s)]
*  that's addictive is awesome. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10687.36s)]
*  Except maybe gambling. But if you win [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10689.36s)]
*  it's awesome. But when you win that's a fucking nice one. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10691.36s)]
*  All of it's awesome. There's a reason why people get addicted [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10693.36s)]
*  to things. They're addicted to [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10695.36s)]
*  things that give them that crazy dopamine rush. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10697.36s)]
*  Whatever the fuck it is. I never got [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10699.36s)]
*  into gambling because I think I got out of it [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10701.36s)]
*  at a young age. Because we [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10703.36s)]
*  gambled in Greek town. I grew up in Baltimore. [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10705.36s)]
*  I grew up in Greek town. I think two of my friends [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10707.36s)]
*  growing up just happened to be like [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10709.36s)]
*  compulsive gambling. We had a bookie [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10711.36s)]
*  when we were like 14. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10713.36s)]
*  He would call in football games. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10715.36s)]

*  culture to get exposed to as [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10925.36s)]

*  Just the game was so exciting. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10941.36s)]
*  Interesting. And to play for money [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10943.36s)]
*  when you're down on a ball and if [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10945.36s)]

*  knives sharp. They always play. Like you can [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10967.36s)]
*  play. And so they would make them handicap. [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10969.36s)]
*  They would have to give you extra balls on the wire [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10971.36s)]
*  or extra games on the wire rather or extra balls in the game. [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10973.36s)]
*  But you would be able to play [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=10975.36s)]

*  brought pool to the Philippines in the 1950s. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11025.36s)]

*  mastered that shit. Fuck yeah. [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11029.36s)]
*  Also because they're playing outside. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11031.36s)]
*  So they have all this moisture on the table. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11033.36s)]
*  And then they have fucked up tables that are out of balance. [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11035.36s)]
*  So they just developed the best strokes. [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11037.36s)]
*  They know how to like [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11039.36s)]

*  That's great. Dude. Take that GIs. [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11043.36s)]
*  They came over here and changed the game. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11045.36s)]
*  Efren Reyes. He came over here under a [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11047.36s)]

*  guys play for money. And I was like this is [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11087.36s)]

*  enjoyed doing. Just having [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11099.36s)]

*  by jobs that make you dress a certain [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11103.36s)]

*  A lot of those guys had [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11115.36s)]
*  their shins broken. A lot of them were [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11117.36s)]
*  drug addicts. [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11119.36s)]
*  I was exposed to the world of like [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11121.36s)]
*  guys who use heroin and coke. [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11123.36s)]
*  Everybody did something. Everybody was doing pills. [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11125.36s)]
*  Everybody was doing something. They were all doing drugs. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11127.36s)]
*  Yeah the color of money is my [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11129.36s)]
*  only like you know. [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11131.36s)]
*  Kind of. There's moments in [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11133.36s)]
*  that movie where it's kind of maybe [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11135.36s)]
*  a little bit accurate. Not totally. [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11137.36s)]
*  It's just a great movie but it's like [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11139.36s)]
*  sometimes they don't nail the [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11141.36s)]
*  verisimilitude. Well they nailed it with [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11143.36s)]
*  do you ever see when Tom Cruise [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11145.36s)]
*  pull up the scene Tom Cruise plays [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11147.36s)]
*  Grady Stevens in the color of money. [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11149.36s)]
*  Oh hell yeah. I don't remember that one. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11151.36s)]
*  This is why. This is important. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11153.36s)]
*  The guy he's playing [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11155.36s)]
*  is really the best player in the world at the time. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11157.36s)]
*  The guy he's playing is Keith [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11159.36s)]
*  McCready. They call him the earthquake. [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11161.36s)]
*  Keith McCready. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11163.36s)]
*  When he was young dude he made [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11165.36s)]
*  people quit pool. Guys would [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11167.36s)]
*  just lose fifty thousand hundred [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11169.36s)]
*  thousand dollars to him. He was an assassin. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11171.36s)]
*  God damn. Just an assassin out [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11173.36s)]
*  of California. And he played out of [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11175.36s)]
*  Hard Times Billiards. And this motherfucker [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11177.36s)]
*  was like legendary through the whole [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11179.36s)]
*  country for gambling. And the way [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11181.36s)]
*  he played he played with a side arm [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11183.36s)]
*  stroke because he learned how to play pool [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11185.36s)]
*  when he was so small he couldn't reach the table. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11187.36s)]
*  So he couldn't dangle [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11189.36s)]
*  his cue in a normal way. He had to do a side arm. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11191.36s)]
*  And he just kept it going his whole life. He kept it that way his whole career. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11193.36s)]
*  See if you can find that scene. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11195.36s)]
*  Tom Cruise plays Grady Stevens. So he [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11197.36s)]
*  plays this character in this movie who [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11199.36s)]
*  is the number one pool player in the world. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11201.36s)]
*  What's interesting about it is he like legitimately [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11203.36s)]
*  was. So when you watch him [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11205.36s)]
*  shoot the ball and move the ball around that's [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11207.36s)]
*  what like an elite top of the food [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11209.36s)]
*  chain assassin for money [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11211.36s)]
*  pool player looks like. That's sick. [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11213.36s)]
*  Because that's what Keith McCready was. He was an [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11215.36s)]
*  assassin for money. Like [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11217.36s)]
*  guys would bet like shit tons of money. [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11219.36s)]
*  And he'd be talking shit to you while he's screwing [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11221.36s)]
*  his cue together. And like the stuff [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11223.36s)]
*  that he said in the movie was like stuff that he really [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11225.36s)]
*  would say to guys. Do those guys get stiffed and shit? [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11227.36s)]
*  Like do I mean like. Because if you're a good pool [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11229.36s)]
*  player you're not necessarily. They get robbed. [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11231.36s)]
*  People show up with guns. It happens all the time. [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11233.36s)]
*  So this is that's Keith McCready. [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11235.36s)]
*  Oh wow. That's the earthquake. So this is him. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11237.36s)]
*  Give me some volume on this. [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11239.36s)]
*  So when you watch him play [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11241.36s)]
*  that's how a [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11243.36s)]
*  really truly elite pool player [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11245.36s)]
*  looks. Like the difference between [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11247.36s)]
*  the control. But it's also the control [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11249.36s)]
*  that he has of the cue ball. [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11251.36s)]
*  Is like he can put that ball within a couple of [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11253.36s)]
*  inches anywhere he wants all over the table. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11255.36s)]
*  He was a wizard. [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11257.36s)]
*  And so when you're watching him do this [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11259.36s)]
*  in this movie it's 100 percent [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11261.36s)]
*  like [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11263.36s)]
*  it would be if he was really playing you. [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11265.36s)]
*  Just fucking shitting on him. Just talking shit. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11267.36s)]
*  You get your ass fucked. [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11269.36s)]
*  There's nothing you can do about it. The idea is that Tom [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11271.36s)]
*  Cruz has to play badly. Because [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11273.36s)]
*  he's playing Grady Stevens so he has to lose [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11275.36s)]
*  so that the odds on him will be [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11277.36s)]
*  very low when he goes to a tournament because the word [[03:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11279.36s)]
*  will get out that Grady robbed him. Right. [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11281.36s)]
*  So he's going to dump this money to Grady. Which is all [[03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11283.36s)]
*  shit that people really do. Yeah yeah. But then he gets [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11285.36s)]
*  mad. It's killing him. It's killing him inside. [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11287.36s)]
*  Because Grady's talking too much shit. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11289.36s)]
*  And so eventually [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11291.36s)]
*  Tom Cruise decides [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11293.36s)]
*  that he's going to talk shit back. [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11295.36s)]

*  This is when they're at the big tournament. [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11301.36s)]
*  What I love about this movie too is like I had no idea [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11303.36s)]
*  about all the fucking actual pool shit. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11305.36s)]
*  But it's like it's such an interesting movie from [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11307.36s)]
*  just the fucking film perspective. Because it's like [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11309.36s)]
*  Scorsese. Scorsese when he's just like [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11311.36s)]
*  fuck it I'll be a hired gun. Like that wasn't his [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11313.36s)]
*  passion project. He was just like I'm going to make [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11315.36s)]
*  a fucking sick movie. Yeah. And then you have [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11317.36s)]

*  this beautiful like [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11325.36s)]
*  almost like passing of the torch. [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11327.36s)]
*  I love any time [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11329.36s)]
*  like a career. [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11331.36s)]
*  The guys in the movies it really mirrors [[03:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11333.36s)]
*  the characters. There's something so fucking awesome [[03:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11335.36s)]
*  and poetic about that. Right the same points in their lives. [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11337.36s)]
*  Where it's like Paul Newman is the fucking old piece of ass. [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11339.36s)]
*  Fucking star. [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11341.36s)]

*  Tom Cruise is about to ascend. It's [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11345.36s)]
*  this fuck. And then Paul Newman would go on to have [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11347.36s)]
*  the whole his the later you know part [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11349.36s)]
*  where he plays great you know great [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11351.36s)]
*  roles. The fucking verdict rules. I don't remember if it was before [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11353.36s)]
*  or after this. But just like I [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11355.36s)]
*  love that shit dude. And it was like Tom [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11357.36s)]
*  and just to see those guys just [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11359.36s)]
*  against each other for real as [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11361.36s)]
*  actors in the same way that their [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11363.36s)]
*  characters are going. And it's like all of that [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11365.36s)]
*  directed by Scorsese. And it was all [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11367.36s)]
*  written by Walter Tevis [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11369.36s)]
*  who is the same guy who wrote The Queen's Gambit. [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11371.36s)]
*  Oh wow holy fuck. Yeah. [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11373.36s)]
*  He also wrote The Hustler. [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11375.36s)]
*  The original Paul Newman Jackie Cleason. [[03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11377.36s)]
*  Great fucking movie. He wrote that and he [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11379.36s)]
*  wrote The Color Money and he wrote The Queen's Gambit. [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11381.36s)]
*  Yeah that's sick. Which is amazing. [[03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11383.36s)]
*  And yeah it had another thing that I really like which is like [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11385.36s)]
*  a weird unofficial [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11387.36s)]
*  sequel thing where it's like [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11389.36s)]
*  it is a sequel but it's like no one except [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11391.36s)]
*  Paul Newman. Yeah. Like I love [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11393.36s)]
*  when they just they extend a story and it's done. [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11395.36s)]
*  Because like the odds of that working [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11397.36s)]
*  are so fucking low. Right especially with a star. [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11399.36s)]
*  You gotta bring in a star like Tom Cruise. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11401.36s)]
*  Yeah dude. And they had to teach him how to play [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11403.36s)]
*  pool. Yeah. So they brought in Mike Siegel [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11405.36s)]
*  to teach him how to play pool. He's one of [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11407.36s)]
*  the greatest pool players of all time. [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11409.36s)]
*  And he's also left handed the way Tom Cruise [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11411.36s)]
*  is which is what really benefited him. [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11413.36s)]
*  But he taught him how to play pool like [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11415.36s)]
*  I mean a version. Not as good [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11417.36s)]
*  of course as Mike Siegel but a version of the way [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11419.36s)]
*  Mike plays. Interesting. You can watch like Mike [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11421.36s)]
*  Stroke the way Mike moves balls around. [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11423.36s)]
*  And what's cool about like I guess we didn't know that [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11425.36s)]
*  or I wasn't lying but it's like you didn't know [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11427.36s)]
*  that it wasn't clear about Tom Cruise [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11429.36s)]
*  at the time where it's like wow that's really impressive [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11431.36s)]
*  that he would learn how to play pool. And now the motherfucker's [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11433.36s)]
*  like jumping out of fucking jets. [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11435.36s)]
*  I know. Like he's just he's a fucking [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11437.36s)]
*  lunatic. Dude you don't know how hard it is [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11439.36s)]
*  to look like you can play pool. [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11441.36s)]
*  He looked like he could play pool. For sure. [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11443.36s)]
*  I mean it really you believed it. He hit a couple shots [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11445.36s)]
*  in the movie where it's like that's fucking [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11447.36s)]
*  impressive. He figured out how to play [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11449.36s)]
*  pool like pretty quickly which is [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11451.36s)]
*  kind of amazing. Fascinating guy. [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11453.36s)]
*  Yeah. Truly truly fascinating guy. [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11455.36s)]
*  Believing in Scientology seems to [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11457.36s)]
*  work for him. I'm not saying [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11459.36s)]
*  it's for everybody. Yeah yeah yeah. But there's something [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11461.36s)]
*  about the way it worked for him. For him [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11463.36s)]
*  dude. And just how smart it was to go [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11465.36s)]
*  to do the Mission Impossible movies [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11467.36s)]
*  to kind of like his career kind of went [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11469.36s)]
*  to the next level in a strange way. [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11471.36s)]
*  Yeah. Look at that shot. [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11473.36s)]
*  That's beautiful. He really did that shit. [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11475.36s)]
*  He really did that shit. That's awesome. You saw it. [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11477.36s)]
*  You saw it from the beginning to the end. And he [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11479.36s)]
*  ran the table on certain racks. [[03:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11481.36s)]
*  What they did is basically they set [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11483.36s)]
*  balls up for him and they let him like [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11485.36s)]

*  I'm telling you [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11497.36s)]
*  Scientology seems to work for him. [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=11499.36s)]

*  it's kind of crazy how close it is [[03:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=12099.36s)]
*  to the original one in terms of like maybe [[03:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=12101.36s)]
*  we're just looking at a grainy copy. [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxusL6n5BZQ&t=12103.36s)]
