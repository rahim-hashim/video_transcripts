# Joe Rogan Experience #1414 - Mike Baker
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 18, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ0GD9SpH_o)
*  Hello, Mike Baker.
*  Hello.
*  Good to see you, buddy.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Thanks for having me back on.
*  My pleasure.
*  So tell me what's up.
*  Are we in trouble?
*  What's going on, man?
*  No, it's World War III.
*  Haven't you heard?
*  Is it?
*  No, it's not.
*  No, I'm here to burst that bubble, I think.
*  Not that everyone's going to say, okay, I'm writing this down, Mike said, no, World War
*  III.
*  But it was amazing how fast the, I'll put that closer there.
*  It was amazing how fast the narrative came out.
*  Yeah.
*  We barely smoked Sulamani and suddenly the current president's going to get us into this
*  conflict.
*  I was nervous.
*  Well, I think everybody stepped back because it was such a shock to the system.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, when was the last time we dealt with Iran in this fashion?
*  I mean, as opposed to like a harshly worded demarche or a note or maybe an extra sanction
*  here or there.
*  But it was such a strange development that I think it did.
*  The natural reaction was to say, oh my God, here we go.
*  And certainly everybody's exhausted from 19 years out there.
*  I was shocked that Trump could make that call because they had a bunch of different options.
*  They're like, or we could kill him.
*  He's like, let's kill him.
*  I was like, whoa, I didn't know you could do that.
*  Well, you know what?
*  He's been a target before.
*  I guess I should first say where I stand on this, which is I'm not mourning his passing.
*  I think he deserved it.
*  I think it's justice that should have been served up some time ago.
*  He's responsible not just for, as people have talked about, the hundreds of US servicemen,
*  but thousands and thousands of people.
*  This guy was a completely bloodthirsty douchebag.
*  There's no way about it.
*  We're talking about the second most, structure-wise, the second most important person within the
*  Iranian regime next to the Ayatollah.
*  But the idea that somehow we took out a foreign leader or a military general like he was some
*  sort of Eisenhower is insane.
*  The guy was a mob boss.
*  He was the head terrorist for a state that is the number one sponsor of terrorism around
*  the world.
*  But he's been on target lists for a long time.
*  You go back to 2008, there was an operation to take out a guy named Mugneer, who himself
*  was also a bloodthirsty psychopath.
*  He was running Hezbollah operations.
*  So the Israelis had been tracking him, as had we.
*  At one point, they had an opportunity to take out Mugneer and also Soleimani.
*  They backed off at the time, essentially because the US wouldn't get behind the idea that we're
*  going to take out Soleimani.
*  That was, at that point, that was a step too far.
*  So eventually we got Mugneer.
*  But Soleimani is just, I mean, I don't even know where to start with the amount of blood
*  that he's responsible for.
*  People talk about, again, OK, he authorized operations and activities in Iraq against
*  US soldiers and against Iraqi soldiers and Iraqi civilians.
*  But it goes back to the beginning of that.
*  You could go back to 2003.
*  And Soleimani was the architect.
*  He dreamt up this idea as the US was going into Iraq that he was going to, what he did
*  was insane.
*  He basically authorized, I mean, he's in charge, right?
*  So he authorizes the release of a bunch of Sunnis that they've been holding onto, Iran
*  being Shiite, arch rivals being the Sunnis, essentially.
*  And the Saudis are their arch enemy, a Sunni nation.
*  But he released all these Sunni extremists that Iran had been holding onto, essentially
*  ever since we had gone into Afghanistan right after 9-11.
*  And he released them into Iraq, including a guy named Zarqawi, who became the head of
*  al-Qaeda in Iraq.
*  Within a few months of our getting out to Iraq, the Sunnis, basically under Soleimani's
*  tutelage, had a series of bombings and started bombing everything from Shiite mosques to
*  UN facilities, Jordanian embassy, a variety of targets, killing thousands of Shiites.
*  Now he's a Shiite, right?
*  So this is how bad this guy is.
*  He goes into Iraq with this plan that I'm going to push the Shiite in Iraq to Iran.
*  I'm going to make them come to us for protection, for coverage, essentially.
*  We can ride in there because what does he want?
*  He wants to exert their influence within Iraq.
*  He doesn't want a strong Iraq.
*  He doesn't want the U.S. in there building a strong, stable Iraq.
*  I mean, you go back to the Iran-Iraq war where Soleimani started his military career.
*  And you know, he's not, there's no way, he's a true believer, there's no way he's ever
*  going to let Iraq become stable again.
*  And he's insane enough that he kills thousands of Shiite, his own people, right, in order
*  to push the Shiite population in Iraq to Iran.
*  I don't know if I'm being eloquent enough.
*  False flag operations?
*  Who's he blaming?
*  Yeah, it's not the Sunnis.
*  It's the Sunnis are doing it.
*  The Sunni extremists.
*  Yeah, but he's authorized and he's pushed them into Iraq to do this.
*  And so he was always very unusually capable at walking a fine line between his own Shiite
*  beliefs, population, everything, and at times being able to be sort of a puppet master for
*  Sunni extremists when it suited his cause.
*  And it's, I mean, it's fascinating stuff, whether it was dealing with Hezbollah, the
*  Palestinian Islamic Jihad or whomever.
*  He, again, I keep going back to the same thing.
*  He deserved what he got, no doubt in my mind.
*  And I'm just surprised it didn't happen sooner, maybe not from us, but from others.
*  Back in October, the Iranians claimed that they foiled an assassination attempt against
*  Soleimani by Israel and some unnamed Arab agents.
*  So it's not as if we just plucked his name out.
*  He'd spent two decades engaged in death and mayhem.
*  Now the take on him dying has not been like the take on Baghdadi.
*  And Baghdadi, one of the most disturbing things that I saw was the Washington Post called
*  him an astur religious scholar.
*  Did you see that?
*  Yeah.
*  When that guy died, they called him an astur religious scholar.
*  And people that I talked to that understand who he was and what was going on there were
*  fucking fuming.
*  They were like, what is this?
*  Who the fuck wrote this?
*  Right.
*  Like you're talking about a goddamn terrorist, a real legitimate murderous terrorist, and
*  you're calling him an astur religious scholar.
*  Right.
*  You're giving him this credibility.
*  So I don't understand that either.
*  I saw that and I talked to a handful of people who kind of leaned in that direction.
*  And also you get the same thing with Soleimani.
*  Now Soleimani, I can understand he's wrapped in the cloak of a military uniform and people
*  saw him sitting next to the Aetola and they're like, oh, okay.
*  But I look at it the same way.
*  This is not assassinating a foreign leader.
*  This is not assassinating a revered scholar.
*  These are taking out terrorists, bloodthirsty terrorists who have a long track record of
*  killing people.
*  And he was not choosy.
*  With Soleimani we're talking about, again, Iraqis, Yemenis, Syrians, his own people.
*  They talk about maybe some 1,500 or so protesters being killed in Iran in the past few months
*  as a result of the protests against the Iranian regime, primarily because of corruption, the
*  that they've driven that economy into a toilet at the expense of the Iranian people, lack
*  of rights of any sort.
*  And Soleimani, again, is the head of the Quds Force, the number two person there.
*  He's responsible.
*  So I don't understand anybody who doesn't just say, yeah, and I think the left had a
*  hard time with it.
*  The hard left, you saw them spinning a little bit saying, okay, we don't say he shouldn't
*  have gotten it.
*  We don't say he didn't deserve it.
*  But and then they had to try to figure out some way to because it's all got to be about
*  politics now.
*  So they bring it back to the current president, to Trump.
*  Whenever Trump does anything, even if what he does is fantastic, they can't get behind
*  it.
*  They almost have to go against things that are great.
*  Like if the economy is great, they've got to find a reason why it's bad that the economy
*  is great.
*  If it's his decisions lead to something positive, they can't accept it.
*  It's unfortunate.
*  Well, we've lost our ability to, I think, to look at things just in an objective fashion
*  in any sense of the word objective, or certainly we don't have civil conversations anymore.
*  But the idea that we can look at and separate the politics from it.
*  Look, again, I don't care whether people like Trump or not.
*  I don't, you know, I didn't vote for him.
*  I don't necessarily care for the individual.
*  But that doesn't mean I can't like policies.
*  And whether you're talking about what's going on with Iran, whether you're talking about
*  the way that we've been dealing with China lately, other issues.
*  Hey, I liked President Obama.
*  Didn't like his policies.
*  You know, I don't necessarily like Trump.
*  I like his policies.
*  I don't see any conflict there.
*  Anyway.
*  No, I don't see any conflict there either.
*  I mean, people are complicated.
*  And I just didn't know that Trump could make the call.
*  Like he could be the guy that goes take him out.
*  Like when I thought that was like, there was probably a panel of military leaders and like
*  really important people that understand the ramifications.
*  Not a fucking game show host.
*  Like in America's Got Talent or something.
*  Yeah.
*  Four people sitting there hitting a buzzer.
*  I felt like it would be like something that they would discuss.
*  Not that Trump would be like, yeah, option three, fuck him.
*  Well, but they talk about it.
*  And there is a great deal of conversation that goes on, not necessarily with the president.
*  You know, I have no idea how he processes his information.
*  But there's a great deal of conversation and discussion that goes on in the Pentagon within
*  the intel community and National Security Council.
*  What happens once they lay out these options in front of the president?
*  You know, I don't have a clue.
*  But he does have that authority.
*  He's got that ability.
*  And President Obama had that authority.
*  President Obama took out, remember, you know, US citizens, you know, who were overseas in
*  the Middle East.
*  And there was a hue and cry over sort of the legality of it.
*  But you didn't see a lot of people saying, you know, and in part, okay, I admit because
*  it wasn't again, this, you know, Suleimani is wrapped in a cloak of his military uniform.
*  It's also people are very concerned about this possibility of us going to war with Iran.
*  And they think that this might have like started that off.
*  Yeah, yeah, I think what changed the calculus here is Iran is, you know, the regime is brutal
*  and awful.
*  They're not crazy.
*  And the one thing they want more than anything else is to retain power.
*  That's it.
*  And I think they looked at the idea of a military conflict, a direct military conflict with
*  the US.
*  And this is not to say that their proxies won't, you know, strike out at some place
*  around the world at some point.
*  But the regime looked at that and thought, you know what, we're not going to do this
*  in part because, you know, the killing of Suleimani is important on a much bigger level
*  than just taking out, you know, a terrorist of his stature.
*  It's important for deterrence purposes.
*  And so, you know, again, I think they looked and felt like the calculus in dealing with
*  the US has shifted now, and they don't understand it.
*  They're not comfortable with it.
*  And also, they can't afford it.
*  Look, if we got in a military conflict, that was just the idea that, you know, somehow
*  we were going to get in World War Three, it would be over in an evening.
*  Literally, it would be over in one night.
*  We have the ability to take out their entire energy infrastructure, their missile bases,
*  their key military facilities.
*  And I don't want to oversimplify this, but after that first night's activity, that's
*  it.
*  They're done.
*  So the idea that somehow there's going to be the – now, does that mean that, you know,
*  we should do that?
*  Of course not.
*  Nobody wants a military conflict.
*  But, you know, and again, there would be knock-on repercussions, et cetera, et cetera.
*  So hopefully we can sort this thing out through now that we're doing the military deterrence
*  and they understand that we're serious.
*  We've got the economic pressures.
*  pressure, primarily to keep them isolated.
*  I think, you know, I think we're on the right track with Iran.
*  I think we're going to see a different reaction from them.
*  Well, I was a little bit relieved when they attacked back and just sort of like launched
*  missiles on the outside of bases.
*  Nobody died.
*  I was like, okay, so it seems like this is almost like they're making a signal, like
*  they're attacking, but they're not really doing anything.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there was an optic to it.
*  I think you're right.
*  Absolutely.
*  That they felt like they had to do something.
*  Yeah.
*  The Ayatollahs got a, I don't know what they call it, saving face or not.
*  But, you know, and we had a warning.
*  We have warning ahead of time.
*  And didn't they print in their paper, didn't they say that they killed a bunch of people?
*  They did.
*  Yeah.
*  They claimed about 80 or so, I think.
*  Keep saying it.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  Just whatever it takes.
*  But then, I mean, you know, but look at the reaction that we've had.
*  Ukrainian commercial passenger jet went down.
*  Yeah.
*  And that was them, right?
*  Oh, that was definitely them.
*  Do you think that they shot it down because they thought it was a US military plane?
*  Yeah.
*  Look, this is, it's not unprecedented.
*  I mean, we shot down an Iranian passenger jet years and years ago, right?
*  The Russians shot down, they still won't admit to it, but they shot down a passenger jet
*  over Ukraine.
*  Yeah, what, just a handful of years ago, which they still won't admit to.
*  It's human error.
*  And it's human error in a conflict zone, in a situation where there's a lot of moving
*  parts and it's never going to be a zero-risk game.
*  So if the Iranians had done this, as tragic as it is, and come out and said, oh my God,
*  we did this.
*  Okay.
*  Well, it would have been horrific, but they did this to themselves because they just couldn't
*  bring themselves to be truthful.
*  They've got a long track record of not.
*  And so they engaged in this and shot it down.
*  When you find missile debris in a field where you're doing an investigation of a plane crash,
*  that's a pretty good indication.
*  And then there's the video on top of that.
*  Oh, there is a video of the missile hitting the plane?
*  Yeah, two missiles.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  Yeah, 30 seconds apart, roughly 30 seconds apart.
*  So two missiles to bring down a plane?
*  Yeah, hit the first one.
*  The first one hit.
*  And then about 30 seconds later, not quite 30 seconds later, the second missile hits.
*  There's another fireball.
*  The plane stays up in the air for a period of time just because it's not devastated,
*  but it was some 20 miles from the airport.
*  It had actually kind of made it as if it was turning back to the airport, probably right
*  after that first missile hit.
*  But here's the thing.
*  So that's a tragic disaster right there.
*  But the idea that somebody – nobody's actually saying they did it on purpose.
*  They didn't do it on purpose.
*  They did it – it was an accident.
*  They mistook it for either an incoming missile or a hostile aircraft coming in for a bombing
*  run after they launched their ballistic missile strike.
*  So nobody's saying it was done on purpose.
*  But it's – again, it's indicative of the Revolutionary Guard force and the regime
*  itself that they spent several days denying it and saying it was mechanical failure and
*  pressuring the Ukrainians to come out and say it was mechanical failure, which they
*  then reversed course on that once it became obvious.
*  Yeah, so it's a tragic situation.
*  But now the protests out in the streets of Iran, which are a continuation of the past
*  several months, which were targeted at a corrupt regime, have picked up strength in
*  light of that because the people are just – we're tired of this.
*  And who knows where it's going to go.
*  I suspect, unfortunately – I'm fairly cynical about all this.
*  We've been hoping the Iranian population would kind of rise up for decades.
*  And it doesn't happen because it's a pretty brutal regime.
*  We don't understand that.
*  We don't understand how difficult they are and how serious-minded they are about holding
*  on to power.
*  So every now and then we think, okay, here come the protests.
*  I'm just going to topple the regime.
*  It doesn't happen.
*  So maybe it's different this time.
*  I don't think so.
*  Now were you concerned at all – and this is one of the things when you say that we
*  could go in there and level them in a day – the real issue is their allies, right?
*  The real issue is China and Russia.
*  Yeah, but they're not going to do anything.
*  China and Russia aren't going to do anything.
*  It's not in their best interest.
*  If they're consistent about one thing, both those countries, it's that they act in their
*  own best interests.
*  And they would look at that and go, yeah, I'm sorry.
*  So what are we dealing with in that immediate area?
*  Iran's closest ally is Syria.
*  Soleimani spent billions of Iranian dollars or money that they couldn't afford to and
*  that should have been spent on its population, arming, training, equipping, and dealing
*  with the Syrian war and keeping his pal Assad in power.
*  So Iran and Syria are tied together, but is Syria in a position to somehow rise up and
*  engage?
*  This wouldn't have been a conflict as we imagine it, right?
*  It wouldn't be a conflict of occupying space and ground and all the rest of it.
*  Nobody wants it.
*  Nobody needs it.
*  It's not good for anybody.
*  I'm not saying that.
*  I'm just saying that in the scheme of things, we would have overwhelming superiority.
*  And yeah, I can't imagine a scenario where Russia would come in.
*  And in fact, we would probably, as anybody would, we would say, okay, look, the Russian
*  military is in Syria.
*  We're going to liaise with you, going to advise you, you know, shit's coming down.
*  Because the last thing we want to do is drag them into it by hitting some of their facilities
*  or personnel or whatever.
*  So there would be that level of coordination, which there always is no matter who the parties
*  are.
*  There's always some element of coordination.
*  But anyway, yeah, I don't see that happening.
*  I think we've averted that.
*  I hope we've averted sort of further military conflict.
*  I think the Iranian regime understands that it's a new day, perhaps that they'll come
*  to the table eventually.
*  That's what this whole maximum pressure campaign's about, is to, again, create sufficient economic
*  pressure, ensure that they understand the idea of deterrence, which I think they do
*  after this strike on Soleimani.
*  And that goes back a ways.
*  This wasn't just like something that just, you know, they thought of after an American
*  contractor was killed.
*  The Iranian regime had been ratcheting up their aggressiveness and their attacks and
*  their various operations out in that region for quite a while.
*  And we had been talking to them about it or getting the signal to them that you've got
*  to stop this.
*  And back in December, they were told, if you continue this path, we are going to take serious
*  action.
*  And we did.
*  How difficult is it to get intelligence on what they're up to and what they're planning,
*  what they're responsible for?
*  When you're here in America, how do we do it?
*  Who's over there?
*  How do they do that?
*  How do they find out exactly what these guys are up to?
*  Well, a lot of it's old school human intelligence, so through sources.
*  And a lot of that sourcing comes from our allies, so whether it's the Israelis or the
*  Jordanians or the Saudis or whomever.
*  So they know someone who's on the inside?
*  How does it work?
*  They've got a source.
*  They've got some recruited asset.
*  It's always been a tough target for us, just like North Korea is a tough target.
*  And so we rely heavily on our liaison partners.
*  But oftentimes, no matter how good your signal's intelligence is, no matter how good you are
*  at gathering SIGINT or photo interpretation, overhead imagery, it's still, to this day,
*  no matter how good technology gets, you can't beat having an asset, having a human who's
*  sitting in a meeting somewhere.
*  And then for whatever their motivation is, whatever their reason for doing it, they're
*  cooperating with you or our liaison partners.
*  And they're saying, here's what happened.
*  Or here's how that person looked.
*  Maybe you get signals intelligence because you're picking up communications.
*  And then what do you got?
*  You got something on a piece of paper and you're reading a transcript of a meeting.
*  But if you've got somebody who's in that meeting and who can tell you what people looked like
*  or what the actual atmosphere was or the mood or the way that...
*  That's invaluable.
*  And so we rely a great deal on that.
*  Basically, you hoover up everything you can from all the various different types of intelligence
*  capabilities.
*  But it's a tough target.
*  I mean, there's no doubt about it.
*  I mean, that's why this whole nuclear weapons program with Iran has always been so difficult.
*  And you talk to people and they go, well, they've got about a 12-month breakout time
*  before they'd have a nuclear weapon.
*  And then other people say, well, I think they got about a three-month breakout time.
*  Well, when you're talking about how long it's going to take them to have a nuclear weapon,
*  you'd like to get those parameters a little closer together, right?
*  So that you're not having a complete guess.
*  But it's tough.
*  And we spend a lot of time working on that.
*  But I would say that we have tremendous allies in that region.
*  And I know that people, it's fashionable nowadays to say, well, the Trump administration,
*  we've been pushing away our allies and they don't want to work with us.
*  And you know what?
*  They do.
*  And in part because, again, it's the same old story.
*  It's in their best interests.
*  Is there any benefit to having someone like Trump who's very difficult to read?
*  Because he's the kind of guy, like when Baghdadi was killed, he said he died like a dog.
*  Like he says crazy shit.
*  And he talks about, like with Iran, that they might respond back with disproportionate results
*  or with a disproportionate response in comparison to the initial attack.
*  Yeah, or the cultural sites.
*  The 52 cultural sites.
*  But that was so crazy, like to represent the 52 people that were kidnapped in the fucking Carter administration.
*  Yeah.
*  What?
*  Yeah, we don't really need to go with the symbolism, fellas.
*  We could just pick some targets, but let's not pick the cultural sites.
*  Yeah, that seems ridiculous.
*  Why would you do that?
*  Those are historic.
*  Yeah. Well, you know what?
*  That's where I say, look, I understand why people go, oh my God.
*  But at the same time, that doesn't mean you can't like policies that are in place.
*  So I always put that out there.
*  I always say, yeah, I get it.
*  That's ridiculous, right?
*  And it's a self-inflicted wound.
*  And you could argue that most of the problems they deal with out of this White House are
*  self-inflicted wounds because there's a lack of discipline.
*  And so it'd be nice if the president was more buttoned up.
*  Of course, that's not going to be the way it works.
*  He, I think, I don't know why I know, but he firmly believes, I think, that this is why he got elected.
*  I think it is why he got elected.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I think a lot of why he got elected is because he's wild and people like it.
*  They like it.
*  They like something different.
*  They're tired of these people that sound like politicians.
*  You know, you hear, you know, pick a person, Elizabeth Warren, you hear them talk and you
*  feel the bullshit coming out of their mouth while they're talking.
*  You know that they're playing a role.
*  You know that they're with Trump.
*  He might be arrogant.
*  He might be crazy.
*  He might be ridiculous.
*  But that's him.
*  That's that guy.
*  I bet if you're around him all day long, he's like that.
*  I mean, that's the thing that people, one of the things that people like about him.
*  He's like that all the time.
*  That's who he is.
*  Yeah.
*  Like he's not bull, he doesn't need to bullshit.
*  He's Donald Trump.
*  He's a fucking multi-billionaire who is now the president of the United States.
*  So it's like he doesn't feel the need to put on an act for anybody.
*  So when he comes out and says he died like a dog, like that's how he would talk.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I think the consistency, I think you're right.
*  There is, there's an element of, look, I'm tired, I am tired of the bullshit.
*  I mean, I see what you're saying, but I guess what I think then is, I mean, what are the
*  chances that you get to 20, well, we're in 2020, look at that.
*  But we get down to November to the election and people are just exhausted by it.
*  So they wanted something different.
*  Now they've had it.
*  Are they going to get to this point in November and get ready to vote and think, I can't take
*  another four years of it even though it's entertaining, I'm exhausted.
*  People don't like change.
*  They get scared of change.
*  And if things are going well economically, and if, you know, if it turns out that this
*  thing with Iran doesn't turn into anything disastrous by the time November rolls around,
*  I think he's going to win on a landslide.
*  I really, I don't see, unless Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard get together and then everybody
*  goes, you know what, that would work.
*  Like this is a, this is a real combination of people that I could, I could get behind.
*  Unless it's something like that, where there's like some overwhelming candidate, but I don't
*  see that.
*  I don't, and they seem to be pushing for Elizabeth Warren.
*  I don't see that.
*  Yeah.
*  She's a Republican most of her career.
*  And then she became a Democrat, like when she was in her late forties.
*  I find maybe it's just me, but, but, you know, I don't see a consistent policy message there.
*  I don't see, I don't see that happening for, for her, this go around.
*  Maybe, maybe it'll change.
*  Maybe you need, I don't know, but it.
*  The problem is I feel like these people just want to be president.
*  I feel like it's a self aggrandizement thing.
*  They just want to be president.
*  I think you could argue that about anybody in politics.
*  So you could, you could say that, I mean, you know, you've met that person, right?
*  It was in politics now who started out by being head of the Republican or Democrat club
*  in high school.
*  That's all they want to do.
*  Then they're a state Senator.
*  And then they say, Oh, am I going to run for Congress?
*  And you think, what the, what the fuck?
*  I mean, it's gotta be something, you know, the wiring is off a little bit.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  That's the problem, right?
*  Anybody that wants to be president, you wouldn't want to be president.
*  Well, I mean, I think if you, if you look at, if you look at who they've got on the
*  other side, right?
*  I mean, I thought for a while that maybe the Republicans are going to primary Trump, right?
*  And then I realized that's a crazy ass idea.
*  No one's ever going to do that.
*  No one's going to get in there and go against stir it up with him for a primary.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, yeah.
*  Who?
*  There's no one that stands out.
*  Like you would need someone that already stands out.
*  I mean, here we are in January.
*  You would need someone that already stands out.
*  We're talking about doing something 10 months from now.
*  You need someone that's already in the public eye.
*  You can't just jump to the head of the line like that.
*  No, especially from the Republican side.
*  If he, if you say he wins again in 2020, you've got four years.
*  I tell you one person I would, I would love to see jump in.
*  I don't think she'd ever do it, but would be Condoleezza Rice and just super smart,
*  good person, you know, terrific.
*  I don't know.
*  But again, I don't think that's going to, I don't think it's going to happen.
*  I don't know that we've.
*  Do you think she would run for president?
*  I mean, I would like to think so.
*  I doubt it.
*  She hasn't shown any interest in it.
*  I think she's enjoying private life too much.
*  Yeah.
*  All the shit she went through with Iraq.
*  Yeah.
*  The Iraq war and everything.
*  She's probably like, take that, stick it up your ass.
*  I'm going to hang out in my ranch or whatever the fuck she's got.
*  Don't they all have ranches?
*  I was figuring they all go to Wyoming.
*  Anybody who comes out of the Republican administration has got to have a ranch.
*  You get a ranch somewhere and you lay low.
*  Like Cheney, he's got a ranch.
*  He's got, he definitely got a ranch.
*  That's a ranch guy.
*  Bush has got a ranch.
*  He could be better aim, but he's got a ranch.
*  Better aim?
*  Man.
*  Well, I think he was a little drunk at the time.
*  That was one of my favorite times.
*  He shot his friend in the face and his friend apologized.
*  That's how gangster Dick Cheney is.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I got my face in the way, sir.
*  I shouldn't have done that.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I look like a quail, sir.
*  I got my oldest boy for Christmas, 12 years old and great, great, great kid scooter.
*  I got him an airsoft, a Glock replica.
*  And I didn't know much about airsoft.
*  Right?
*  I mean, who does?
*  I mean, I've got to walk in safe full of weapons, but none of them are airsoft weapons.
*  But he really wanted one of his buddies have them and they go out shooting and they do
*  the old school thing, right?
*  They put on a couple of layers of clothes and some eye protection and they go shoot
*  each other.
*  So how could I say no?
*  So we go to the store, to this combat supply shop that specializes in airsoft.
*  And I was really impressed.
*  I mean, the machining on these things is fantastic, right?
*  First of all.
*  And I was expecting some, you know, the old school pellet guns and BB guns, the crossman's,
*  things like that, you know, that are plastic for the most part.
*  But this is a solid piece of work.
*  And anyway, so got him this thing.
*  It's turned out, I don't know where I was going with this shooting and the shot.
*  He's actually, I suspect he's a better shot than Cheney, as it turns out.
*  And he's got his hunting certificate and he's been through that education program.
*  He's in the scouts and so go out shooting every now and then.
*  But it took him almost no time at all, right, in terms of practice to develop.
*  I'm boasting about my 12-year-old's target shooting ability.
*  I realize that's not why most viewers tune in.
*  Sometimes they want to know.
*  Yeah, maybe so.
*  Anyway, so that's Jay.
*  But yeah, I think you're right.
*  Nobody's going to primary this president.
*  I think we're left with this field of potential candidates on the Dem side.
*  And I tend to agree, I think it's going to be a landslide unless there's some of the
*  market tanks for whatever reason, because there's some international crisis somewhere
*  and it sends things down through the floor, maybe.
*  But if the economy stays the way it is and the Dems seem to wander into their primary
*  season as unorganized as they seem to be, I could see them winning again big.
*  Well, I think people want to look at him as being all bad.
*  But if what he's done and the moves that he's made are great for the economy and things
*  appear to be very good, right?
*  Yeah, no, I think, again, you can't, but the problem is they can't separate that.
*  Right, that's what I'm saying.
*  Yeah, you can't find a progressive who's going to stop and go, well, you know, the
*  economy is good.
*  Or if they say it, it always followed by a but.
*  It's not good for everybody.
*  Well, it's never good for everybody.
*  It's true, too.
*  Yeah, it isn't.
*  No.
*  Yeah, I mean, they want the economy to be the way it is, but they want Bernie Sanders
*  economic policies.
*  You know, it's interesting because I think that someone who supports big business the
*  way Trump does, he encourages people to move business forward.
*  I mean, it encourages the market, encourages people to spend money.
*  It encourages people to take risks.
*  The more he makes it easier for these big businesses, also the more people get outraged,
*  but then the economy picks up.
*  It's like, boy, there's a I don't know what the correct way to do this is.
*  But there even though I'm not a Trump fan, there are definite benefits to the way he
*  has been running the country.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, when you talk about the just sort of the some of the basic metrics, you look at
*  the unemployment rate, right?
*  I mean, and you know, I would just I just finished a conversation the other day.
*  I mean, Idaho, not to bring in Idaho, but Idaho's got the second strongest state economy
*  in the nation.
*  The unemployment rate is is it's almost negligible.
*  It's crazy how strong it is at this point, because there's solid people up there, solid
*  people. We all have ranches.
*  So that's the other thing.
*  You don't know how to fly fish.
*  Exactly. Oh, there's something to that, though.
*  Solid people.
*  Yeah. I mean, Idaho is a fucking there's real people up there.
*  You go up there. It's fucking cold as shit.
*  There's wolves and bears.
*  Those are real goddamn people.
*  You got to come back. I come back.
*  I would definitely come back.
*  I would definitely come back.
*  I'll schedule something.
*  Yeah, that would be great. But I think that I think the point with the economy is that
*  that it does.
*  And again, I get it. Not everybody's in the stock market.
*  Of course, not everybody's in the stock market.
*  But as it improves or or tax cuts, you know, that whole whole it was only for the rich.
*  It you can't tell me that people haven't been benefiting from it.
*  And yes, you're going to be there's going to be segments that it takes longer or you
*  got to work harder or whatever it is to to feel that improvement.
*  But it's there. And again, I don't see unless unless there's something that sends it
*  head and south. And I think the the Democrats are in a difficult position.
*  They can't talk it down. Michael Bloomberg's trying.
*  He's not a Democrat, though. I know what he is.
*  But he's not what is he? Yeah.
*  He was a Republican. Are there billionaire Democrats?
*  Tom Steyer. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I keep wanting to say Steyer. I don't know why I keep saying Steyer.
*  It makes me sound clever. But Tom Steyer.
*  Yeah. But I think Bloomberg is trying to say, look, this, you know, the economy needs to be
*  adjusted, needs to be fixed. I don't think anybody buys it.
*  Because it just there's no supporting data for that.
*  And so they have a hard time battling against the economy, which is why I think they try to avoid it for the most part.
*  I mean, that debate last night.
*  Did you watch that? No. Yeah.
*  I don't watch them. I didn't push Tulsi Gabbard out.
*  I stopped watching him with you guys are out of your fucking mind.
*  She's the most interesting candidate out there.
*  Yeah. Next to Marianne Williamson.
*  Well, that bitch is crazy.
*  Sorry for using that word.
*  I'm crazy. No, I didn't mean it that way.
*  I say it, you know, it's a term of endearment.
*  But isn't she like a crystal healer or some shit?
*  Yeah. She was trying to come on the podcast, too.
*  I'm like, she's doing a tour.
*  Yeah. That is that's a boat with a lot of holes in it and they're going to make it across the harbor.
*  It was like talking to it's like talking to one of your aunts, right?
*  When he crazy and yeah, it's a crystals comes over for the holidays, you know, so what are you doing?
*  Well, I made you a dream catcher and I think thank you.
*  So dream catcher.
*  I think Bernie Sanders has some interesting thoughts and talking to him in person in real life.
*  I like him a lot.
*  He's not like what he comes off in those goddamn debates because those debates are ridiculous.
*  You get five people in front of the camera.
*  You ask him a question. They have 30 seconds to answer it.
*  Everybody else is jumping in, yelling things out.
*  They're all trying to get a sound bite.
*  Well, that's all it is. It's not it's not actually a debate.
*  I mean, remember the debate club?
*  I mean, it was and it's not it's not that it's it's exactly.
*  Yeah, exactly what you said.
*  It's sound bites, a series of sound bites.
*  They're all looking to have a moment.
*  Yeah. You don't want to screw up.
*  So they want to have a kind of a safe moment.
*  Right. And they go through.
*  I agree with it.
*  I like I like Bernie because he's been consistent.
*  You can go back to the 80s.
*  Yeah. He's saying the same shit that he's saying now.
*  Yeah. And I think there is something to that.
*  Now, I don't I don't buy his arguments.
*  You know, I don't I don't.
*  But I like the guy and I like the fact that he's consistent
*  and he means what he says.
*  And so, you know, again, I can separate out liking him from liking his policies.
*  Yeah, I don't see a problem there, but I don't think they're going to let Bernie.
*  There was there was a moment, I'll tell you about last night,
*  though, on this debate thing, where I think it was the CNN moderator.
*  She asked Elizabeth Warren, Elizabeth Warren had come out the other day
*  and said that she had a private conversation with Bernie.
*  And during the conversation, yeah, Bernie said, you know, a woman's never going to win.
*  That's my Bernie.
*  A woman's never going to win or can't win being president.
*  He was more eloquent than that, but the voice sounded just like it.
*  And and so he's denied it.
*  So the moderator last night during this debate asked Bernie Sanders,
*  let me just be clear, she said, are you saying that you've never said this
*  to Elizabeth Warren?
*  And Bernie said, absolutely not.
*  Very next words out of the moderator's mouth was she turned to Elizabeth Warren
*  and said, so Senator Warren, when Bernie said to you that he never
*  or no, when Bernie said to you that a woman couldn't be president,
*  how did you feel? Jesus Christ.
*  That was it. And so I think that they're not even trying now
*  to hide the fact that they want to marginalize Sanders. Yeah.
*  So why did they want to marginalize him?
*  Because I think they feel they can't. There's no way he can win.
*  Is that what it is? Yeah. I think on a national level, I think.
*  Elizabeth Warren can win after lying about being Native American for a whole life.
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's a fucking big one to me.
*  Oh, by the way, by the way, I was one of my boys was home sick
*  the other day from school, the middle boy sluggo.
*  And so we were sitting on the sofa and I said, you know,
*  you're not feeling you want to watch a movie.
*  Now, God bless him. He's 10 years old. He considers himself a baller.
*  All he wants to do is play basketball. That's all he wants to do with his life.
*  He knows he's going to get recruited by Duke.
*  He knows he's going to end up in the NBA.
*  And but we're sitting there and it was really kind of sweet
*  because he's you know, he's got all this hard side to him and I'm just playing ball.
*  And then he says, well, yeah, let's watch a Disney movie.
*  So we kind of dialed up Disney Plus because we like we're sheep
*  and we bought the Disney Plus thing and and Peter Pan
*  and the original Peter Pan, right, the original Disney Peter Pan.
*  So we turned it on.
*  And I'd forgotten what that movie was like in terms of its treatment
*  of Native Americans. Oh, it's horrible.
*  Oh, my God. So we're watching it.
*  And we get to that part where, you know, they're they're singing that song
*  and the boys, the lost boys are tied up with Wendy and Michael and all.
*  And the chief comes in and he wants to find Tiger Lily, the princess,
*  you know, because, you know, hookers, the viewers are like,
*  what the hell's going on here?
*  So anyway, I'm sitting there and and even sluggo looks at me
*  and he goes, wow, this is kind of racist.
*  Really? But a 10 year old says that.
*  Yeah, a 10 year old says it.
*  I thought, OK, everything was racist.
*  Everything was racist.
*  Well, that's what we had. We had a conversation.
*  I said, yeah, you know what?
*  Yeah, pretty much what I told them.
*  But anyway, well, particularly about Native Americans, I mean, they just
*  they were able to get away with it.
*  Nobody nobody protested it.
*  I've been I'm reading this book now or I'm listening to it on tape
*  called Black Elk Speaks.
*  It's about this Oglala Sue medicine man who was
*  while he was still alive in the 1930s.
*  They wrote this book.
*  He told the story of Custer and he was there.
*  He was a young boy when Custer was killed.
*  And he told the story of like life on the plains and crazy horse.
*  And it's fucking fascinating.
*  What was it written? It's written in 1930s.
*  OK, it's called what Black Elk Black Elk Speaks.
*  Yeah, I've I've listened to on tape.
*  This is like the fourth or fifth one
*  that I've listened to on Native Americans over the last couple of months.
*  But this is the best one.
*  This is the best one, because not that the other ones weren't great.
*  They were great.
*  But what's interesting about this is the actual words
*  of a man who lived that life.
*  It's not just a historical
*  a book about the time and describes the events of the time.
*  This is a guy describing what he saw.
*  And he was talking particularly about war, about the way it was when,
*  you know, they killed Custer and he was there when they killed Custer.
*  And just the the battles between the American soldiers
*  and the Native Americans. It's like it's crazy.
*  It's crazy to think that it happened just a short time ago.
*  And it's also crazy to think that if no one came to America,
*  like if the world just stayed in Europe and Asia
*  and the way it had been before Columbus and before the pilgrims and all that shit,
*  these people would probably still be living like that,
*  because that's not that long ago.
*  Well, I mean, you think about it.
*  What was it? It was a warring tribal culture. Yeah.
*  Well, I mean, where else do we have this?
*  I'm probably going to make a botch at this point, but
*  you know, warring tribal cultures in the Middle East.
*  I mean, it's a difficult environment, right?
*  In which to say, OK, we're going to have some sort of federal system.
*  We're going to come together. We're going to work for the greater good.
*  You know, but I mean, I think it's I will say this.
*  I the most depressing
*  scenes I've ever seen have been on
*  Native American Indian reservations in this country.
*  And I've never been. Oh, my God.
*  I've never been other than casinos.
*  It's just you go and you and I'd look I'd spent most of my
*  adult life overseas, right, in some pretty grim places.
*  And I remember the first time I was on a reservation here in the US.
*  And I thought, how can this how can this possibly be here?
*  And I know that's a naive thought.
*  And people think, well, how could you not know that it was here?
*  But it's, you know, a it's not a good history, but B,
*  it's it's not a good follow up either.
*  I mean, right. We haven't we just to this day, we don't do a very good job at all.
*  And the reservation systems, not not all of them, of course.
*  It's like every year, you know, not every urban center is, you know, crime rate.
*  I mean, that's ridiculous.
*  But I'm just saying in general, you know, some of the most difficult places
*  I've ever seen have been right here in our borders, right on Indian reservations.
*  And good God. Yeah.
*  I want to get someone who's in someone to come in here,
*  who's a Native American, who's a historian, who really understands
*  the history of of their tribe, someone who come in here and talk to me about it,
*  because I just had a sort of a peripheral understanding of it
*  up until about five or six months ago.
*  I really, you know, I I had seen movies and I had read books
*  and I kind of understood, but I didn't really, really get into it
*  until I started reading these books.
*  And it's just it's just incredible to think that there was millions
*  and millions of tribes or millions and millions of members of different tribes
*  living in this country, like basically like Stone Age people.
*  Well, 150 years ago.
*  And oftentimes, you know, in constant conflict with each other. Yes.
*  Oh, that's a big thing that I didn't really understand.
*  Yeah. The horrific things they did to each other, kidnapped each other,
*  tortured each other.
*  And we came along and they're like, come on, lighten up.
*  Geez. We brought them a whole new level.
*  Well, as soon as we figured out repeating guns, as soon as they figured out
*  revolvers with more than one bullet, because they were fighting the Comanches.
*  Originally, they were fighting them with muskets.
*  And the Comanches could shoot like six arrows in 10 seconds.
*  So they would just lighten these fucking soldiers up
*  because they couldn't reload. Right.
*  So they would wait for the initial volley and then they'd charge in.
*  And they also could.
*  There were such great horsemen, they could actually shoot
*  underneath the horse's neck.
*  So they'd hold on to the reins somehow where they were under the horse's neck.
*  And they were protected and they were shooting at the soldiers.
*  And they were shooting from horses.
*  Nobody knew how to do that before.
*  Everybody got off the horse to shoot. Yeah.
*  And they were shooting while they were riding.
*  Yeah. I mean, I feel bad for the horse, but he's covering concealment.
*  That's how the Comanches apparently dominated, is that they had so many horses.
*  They were rich in horses.
*  They were the ones that figured out how to master the horse the best.
*  They also use small horses.
*  They didn't use like these big horses that the Americans use.
*  Right. They were small people.
*  Comanches were fairly small people. Yeah.
*  No, it's it is. It is.
*  It's absolutely it's a fascinating history.
*  I've spent more time reading sort of the military aspects of of
*  of the Indian wars, right, from, you know, the US military side of things.
*  And occasionally it'll a book will stray into sort of, OK, well, let's look,
*  you know, from a perspective of, you know, the whichever tribe
*  they were in battle with, but not usually very good.
*  So I'll pick up this book because it it is it's an amazing history.
*  And you're right. It's not that long ago.
*  This is another great book.
*  Well, there's quite a few of them with Blood and Thunder.
*  It's about Kit Carson. Read that.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Fuck, man. Yeah. That dude.
*  Well, he was a beast. Get him on the show.
*  Yeah, he no, he was tremendous.
*  Right. And from nothing. Right. Came from nothing. Right.
*  And was a small guy.
*  He wasn't, you know, had a soft voice.
*  Yeah, there was a there was a show
*  Men Who Made America, I think, or it was a follow on from that.
*  But they they had a handful of episodes about Kit Carson,
*  but they kind of went through they picked out some of the sort of the
*  the individuals you would imagine. Right.
*  I mean, Daniel Boone and some of the others characters as the frontier.
*  I think the men who built the frontier, I think,
*  was called as a follow on to that series that they did about the men who built America.
*  OK, which seems misogynistic.
*  But women probably helped.
*  They, you know, behind every great titan of industry, there was
*  a woman and several of his mistresses.
*  But I think that this this thing about building the frontiers was interesting.
*  They tried.
*  They tried to provide a perspective from
*  the Native American Indians point of view.
*  I don't think they necessarily did a very good job,
*  because I think they just had so much room to cover.
*  But it was still worth watching.
*  So it was it was a good series.
*  Yeah, I think most of us are pretty ignorant to what goes on on the reservations today.
*  And me included, you know, you hear these horrible stories of alcoholism and poverty.
*  And, you know, it's just they live in these nations inside of a nation.
*  And that's what's very strange.
*  And the only thing that really, you know, is natural resources that can help them.
*  But really gambling gambling becomes a big revenue source for a lot of them.
*  And then then people are trying to gain a system.
*  No pun intended. But people are gaming the system and saying,
*  oh, I'm going to create this non-existent tribe.
*  Right. And then Washington, D.C.
*  is can't swing a dead cat without hitting some lobbyist who's trying to push for
*  designation of some obscure element as a tribe.
*  Right. So they can simply apply for a caiming license.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I don't know. I'm not sure how you how you turn that around.
*  There's the the Native American Indian Museum in D.C.
*  that opened several years back.
*  It's very good. It's a little tough to follow.
*  I will say this much in terms of just the way they've laid the museum out. Right.
*  And but it's it's just absolutely full to the ceiling of incredible stories
*  and artifacts and history bits.
*  But it's definitely worth people going to D.C.
*  If they if they're saying, OK, I'm going to go to the Smithsonian's.
*  They should put that one on the list because it's it's really fascinating.
*  It's really good. Anyway.
*  But what else?
*  Oh, I know what I went to.
*  I was going to bring up because I can't come on the show without talking about Huawei.
*  Oh, so something going on with Huawei again.
*  And only in on the periphery today,
*  the Trump administration signed this first portion of a deal with China.
*  And so it's a trade pact.
*  Right. There's been this trade battle, obviously.
*  And I just I just thought I was flying out here and I was thinking about it.
*  It's interesting dynamic, right, because.
*  You know, people talk about this current administration is not having any strategy,
*  and sometimes it does seem frankly that way.
*  But I was seeing the other day that it is there is actually this
*  an interesting split in terms of how they're dealing with China.
*  So on the one hand, we've got this softening of the trade war.
*  I'm going to they're going to as a result of signing what they signed today
*  with China as sort of the first stage trade agreement.
*  It's mostly involves, you know, increased purchases by China of US goods.
*  There's some talk about them scaling back their theft of intellectual property,
*  scaling back, scaling back.
*  That's a whole area. Yeah.
*  We're going to do it.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  So yeah, we'll take, you know, we're not going to stop stealing.
*  But but there's there's that element to it.
*  But at the same time as they're doing this and as a result of that,
*  we're going to have we're going to cut in half our tariffs on
*  quite a bit of a large amount of goods.
*  And I think we're going to drop the idea of imposing more tariffs on some other goods.
*  But even while we're doing that, so that's happening.
*  But as we're doing that, we're also ratcheting up pressure
*  and some sanctions and some legislation against the technology side of things.
*  So we're still coming down on Huawei.
*  Congress is trying to push through something that's going to make it
*  even more difficult for US companies to do business with them overseas.
*  But I think it's interesting, right, because we're you know, there's
*  there's some people, I think, in Washington who go, well, we can't do both.
*  Well, of course you can do both.
*  Right. You can talk to the Chinese in real terms and say, yeah, let's let's,
*  you know, let's focus on the trade.
*  What we're going to do this.
*  We're going to make it a little bit easier.
*  Let's let's create a trade environment where it's good for both of us.
*  At the same time, you know what?
*  You're still, you know, stealing our shit and Huawei is still a national security threat.
*  So we're still going to focus on this.
*  And, you know, this is not saying I'm singing praises of this current administration.
*  I'm just saying that any administration should be able to operate on different levels.
*  Right. When it comes to the same.
*  But we don't we haven't seemed to do that.
*  It's like with Iran, you know, well, OK, we're in the past.
*  If they just gave some indication that they were going to play ball with us,
*  we'd ease up on the sanctions.
*  All right. Even though they hadn't done anything about their their pursuit of terrorism
*  and other things that they were doing.
*  Because we felt like in Washington, I think sometimes DC is like,
*  you can't do two things at one time that seem to be conflicting.
*  Well, the real world says, I think that you can.
*  So I think China gets it now.
*  I don't think they're going to stop stealing.
*  It seems to be how they operate. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Especially when you consider the fact that the government is so
*  inexorably connected to Huawei, like you when you're explaining how big business
*  and the government are hand in hand, they're not two separate entities.
*  They work completely together.
*  And so with Huawei, since they have been busted,
*  having third party access to data and stealing packets and stuff with routers,
*  because they have done that, you've got to think, well,
*  that's probably a part of the way they do business.
*  Well, it is. It's it's it's it's in their system.
*  I mean, they made a decision decades ago, right?
*  This is how we're going to achieve superiority in the world.
*  We're going to get to the top of the food chain by skipping all the cost
*  and pain of research and development, which is going to hoover up
*  everything we can from not just the US, but everybody.
*  So, you know, part of this, all this this pushback against China
*  has been specifically trying to say, look, you've got to stop that.
*  We understand it. We're calling you out on it. We're doing it.
*  Now, we've tried doing that a handful of times in the past in a half hearted manner.
*  This time, you know, I think the Chinese understand we're more serious about it.
*  And we are trying to to implement certain
*  measures that will prevent some of that theft.
*  But at the same time, I think, as you said, it's part of how they do business.
*  Right. We're not going to.
*  So I think we have to be pragmatic in all of this and think, yeah,
*  it's good that we're pushing them on it.
*  It's good that we're telling us good that we're trying to rebalance
*  the trade environment, that we're calling out Huawei,
*  that we're talking to our allies about not doing business with them,
*  because all they all they really want is they want an access point. Right.
*  So if they do business with the UK, suddenly in this seamless
*  world of communications, now they've got an entry point into the US.
*  So, you know, we're working to try to get our allies to stay on board
*  with us about that.
*  But, yeah, the Chinese, they subsidize Huawei and the government does in a big way.
*  And it's we just have to be realistic.
*  We're not going to change their their behavior in a in a in a major way.
*  They're just going to become more sophisticated or more obtuse about how they do it.
*  Well, the best evidence to me that there's really something going on
*  is that Google's even stepped in. Right.
*  Google, Google's even say we won't even give you our access to Google Store
*  anymore if you want to have a Huawei phone, even if you buy it from overseas.
*  It will not work in the Google ecosystem.
*  Yeah. So what Huawei's done is they've started their own little weird app store
*  and they've started creating their own apps.
*  They're essentially frozen out of the ecosystem that Google provides
*  and the Google Play Store provides.
*  But you can sideload some apps by going to the website.
*  Like you can sideload, you can download some of them and put them on a phone.
*  But they're they're essentially relegated to these weird Chinese versions
*  of a lot of the popular applications.
*  And it's a very limited selection.
*  And when it comes to high end cell phones, like what is the new Huawei phone?
*  I think it's called the Mate 30 Pro.
*  They announced another one.
*  This is the other just now. Yeah. Right.
*  But they all might be there.
*  Fuck him.
*  They literally had announcements today in London.
*  He said, son of a bitch.
*  Son of a bitch.
*  So they their phones, they come out with new ones all the time,
*  like an iPhone, which is the top of the food chain in America. Right.
*  And they come out once a year.
*  Yeah. Once a year, they bang out a new phone.
*  Huawei's cranking these fucking bad boys out every couple of months.
*  And every couple of months, they have a giant leap in improvement.
*  More megapixels, better night vision, more storage,
*  more battery life, more this, more that, higher pixel density in the screens.
*  So their phones literally are the top of the food chain phones.
*  It's really kind of fascinating because a lot of American phones,
*  like look at that bad boy, P 40 design gets leaked showing triple like a camera.
*  Yeah. So they're using like these fucking incredible cameras.
*  Yeah. Sort of.
*  So it's sort of similar to the iPhone.
*  Similar. Interesting. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Well, we copy them a lot.
*  Yeah. No, that's true.
*  I mean, that's a design element of it.
*  Yeah. And but I think I mean, look at look at Huawei.
*  You know, we here we've been banging on about them for for some time.
*  Congress has been trying to take actions.
*  And at the end of this past year, end of what?
*  2019, Huawei reported, you know,
*  some 20 percent increase in their revenues. Yeah, of course.
*  So people are talking about them.
*  Well, I know a lot of people that before this sort of actually doing
*  I'm actually I'm actually, you know, I got a contract with Huawei.
*  So that's why I keep banging on.
*  The Google thing really fucked them up, because before that,
*  a lot of the tech guys in America were buying them from Amazon
*  or buying them from websites and then just putting their SIM cards in it
*  and using it, even though AT&T won't sell them and Verizon won't sell them.
*  But now that won't even work anymore, because now you don't have access
*  to the Google Play Store.
*  If they could figure out a way to sweet talk their way back
*  to the Google Play Store, there would be the biggest fucking cell phone company
*  in the world.
*  They offer a developer twenty six million dollars to build apps
*  for his flagship phones after being banned from using Google's App Store.
*  Yeah. But the thing is, like building the apps is not good enough.
*  You have to have apps that everybody is using. Right. Right.
*  If you make your own Instagram, nobody gives a fuck.
*  You're not on Instagram. Are you on Instagram?
*  It says there are major apps available through always
*  app guys, which is Amazon, Snapchat, Tiktok and Fortnite.
*  But most popular apps are still missing.
*  That's interesting. Amazon's like, fuck you.
*  We want some money. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  I mean, want some money.
*  Jeff Bezos going to the forest.
*  Come get some money.
*  I got a new hot chick and she likes money.
*  Have you seen his new is it his new wife now or just his girlfriend?
*  I think it's just his girlfriend.
*  She used to be married to the former owner of the UFC or the one of the
*  she used to be married to one of the current owners of the UFC.
*  Oh, OK. All right.
*  So she's she like stepped up.
*  Pace stepped up. Man.
*  The owner of the UFC, the very wealthy man, too.
*  But these not Bezos wealthy.
*  No, he's he's on next level wealthy.
*  That's like if you get divorced, for sure, you're getting a billion.
*  Yeah, he's got one hundred and fifty.
*  He can give you a billion just to shut you up.
*  Just like just give her a billion.
*  Let's get this over with.
*  Let's get this over with, Marty.
*  Sign the paperwork.
*  But I can see he's a handsome man.
*  I can see him attracting a really hot.
*  I don't think you're right.
*  I think you're being sarcastic.
*  Look at that face. Wow.
*  He looks like a guy in a movie.
*  He looks a little like Paul Schaefer in that picture.
*  You remember the old David Letterman's old bandleader?
*  Look at this. Yeah, you're right.
*  He does. Yes, Dave. Yeah.
*  Jeff Bezos reportedly threw a star studded birthday bash
*  for his girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez.
*  Look at her. She's like, she should have someone
*  should Photoshop dollar bills on her glasses.
*  But you know, that's not a really good picture of her.
*  She doesn't look she's kind of got a weird.
*  She's hot as fuck. Really?
*  Yeah. But she's you know, she's hot as fuck and almost 50.
*  No. OK. 50th birthday.
*  Yeah. OK.
*  I wonder what he got today.
*  What do you buy when you buy whatever the fuck she wants?
*  Jeff Bezos. I got your card.
*  50. They keep it together. It's a different 50. Yeah.
*  When I was a kid, when a lady was 50, that was a dead lady.
*  She's barely alive.
*  But now 50 year olds, they're in the gym doing squats.
*  They look hot. Yeah.
*  It's just it's different. They exercise.
*  People now imagine you like cruising gyms looking for girls doing squats.
*  No, I'm just saying I've seen 50 year olds that are in very good.
*  Like, who's that? What's that girl? Elizabeth Hurley.
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, she's a fucking movie star.
*  Her Instagram is all pictures of her in her underwear.
*  You know why? Because she's like 53.
*  Yes. Yeah. And she's 54.
*  She's 54. And she's she knows
*  the fucking sand is thin on that hourglass.
*  There ain't a lot of the top the top chamber.
*  There ain't a lot left. Yeah.
*  So she's like she's showing them goods.
*  That Instagram is all her underwear.
*  That name. Who was she with?
*  She was with others. She is.
*  Hugh Grant. Hugh Grant.
*  That's right. Look how hot she is.
*  Yeah. 54. Like if you saw her.
*  Give me another one of those, Jamie.
*  What do you got here? Give me another one of them bikini.
*  There's a bunch of bikini pictures that there.
*  Like if you saw her somewhere, you would go.
*  That's not a 35 year old.
*  Yeah, it's not 54. 54.
*  It's different these days.
*  Yeah. Well, there's a lot of I will say this, though.
*  There are a lot of filters out there.
*  No, that's true. Yeah, I know.
*  I could look 12.
*  But look at that one in the middle.
*  That doesn't look filtered.
*  The one that right there.
*  No, that looks like a party picture.
*  Yeah, that looks like her part.
*  She's she definitely looks.
*  Yeah, she's right.
*  Like she just came off the set from Austin Powers.
*  Yeah, she's fucking hot, man.
*  She's still hot, like legitimately hot.
*  Like people go, yeah, but she's 54.
*  You go, shut the fuck up.
*  What do you know?
*  What's wrong with you, man?
*  Yeah, look at that one.
*  The right with the boobs.
*  Whoa. Yeah.
*  Take it. But when was that taken, though?
*  Last week. Last week.
*  Shut your mouth. Stop ruining my dreams.
*  That was just on Monday.
*  Don't ruin dreams, Mike Baker.
*  You're right. You're right.
*  She's hot as fuck. Yeah.
*  Just putting in the work.
*  Yeah.
*  That middle picture, I'm not sure about the middle picture
*  with the two soldiers there.
*  I'm not sure whether it was that taken in Liechtenstein
*  or where these soldiers from.
*  What's up with their fake mustaches?
*  Do they have painted on mustaches?
*  Do you think they got a whole army of guys like that
*  that come out on the battlefield dressed like that?
*  London Coliseum.
*  Do they make them put rosy cheeks on?
*  No, those are natural.
*  Yeah, it comes like that.
*  That's like the British weather.
*  Cold and damp gives you cheeks like that.
*  How weird.
*  They have fake mustaches, though, right?
*  It's for the ballet. It's for the Nutcracker.
*  Oh, for the ballet.
*  Right here. English National Ballet.
*  I thought there were a couple of Marines.
*  The ballet.
*  A couple of commandos.
*  Just make that picture bigger and cut those dummies out.
*  She looks hot.
*  And look at the one right next to it.
*  Go to the one picture right next to that one, Jamie.
*  That one.
*  Come on, son. Whoa.
*  She's hot as fuck.
*  It's quite the piece of jewelry she's got there.
*  Hanging between those things there.
*  It's just amazing that women can do this now.
*  You couldn't do that before.
*  It's like you hit a wall, and that's welcome to the wall.
*  But here's what I would say.
*  I think those same hot women would argue that for dudes,
*  it's different.
*  You can be a schlub at 54, right?
*  You can just walk out there.
*  You don't give a shit.
*  You're just kind of like...
*  Like Jack Nicholson.
*  Yeah, like Jack Nicholson.
*  Jack Nicholson's 1,000 years old,
*  and he's still banging 20-year-olds.
*  I don't know how he does that.
*  I see sidelines at a Lakers game, and you think, oh my god.
*  I know.
*  You know what it is?
*  It's like most women find him repulsive,
*  but you don't want most women.
*  You want the women that don't find you repulsive.
*  And when you're really, really famous,
*  that's a considerable number.
*  That's what's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  No, that's true.
*  So there's 300 million plus people in this country
*  that's probably of dating age.
*  Let's just say there's 70 million women
*  that could be dating Jack Nicholson.
*  Look at him there.
*  Let's just...
*  I mean, it's probably...
*  I'm probably off.
*  But let's say out of those...
*  So 70 million that he can choose from.
*  Yeah, let's say it's 100 million.
*  Let's get crazy.
*  Let's say it's 100 million.
*  That's quite the picture.
*  Out of those 100...
*  Look at that one.
*  Let's leave that one out.
*  That's my favorite.
*  Leave that one out.
*  Out of those 100 million,
*  90 million of them would think he's disgusting.
*  90 million.
*  So 90 million women would be like, what the fuck?
*  Out of those 10 million,
*  and those 10 million that are left,
*  5 million would be like,
*  well, he's not that bad.
*  And then 1 million would be like,
*  I'd fuck him right now.
*  That's what you want.
*  I think 1 million would fuck that right now.
*  Yes, 1 million.
*  I'll live here.
*  Wow.
*  They're all in Southern California.
*  A lot of...
*  Well, there's some from North Dakota
*  that just want to come to LA.
*  Jack's going to make me famous.
*  He blew up my Instagram.
*  Yeah, I can see that.
*  I can see getting in your Kia
*  and driving across country to fuck that.
*  Look at his glasses.
*  Man.
*  Just look at everything about him.
*  Cheeseburger, fries, doesn't give a fuck.
*  There you go.
*  There he's back in his hay day.
*  That was when he was young.
*  That dude, man.
*  He looked like shit back then.
*  Look at that picture.
*  Look at that collar, though.
*  That was back when a collar meant something.
*  Yeah.
*  It is amazing.
*  And he keeps on rocking in the free world.
*  Yeah.
*  No, yeah.
*  But that's the thing.
*  That's what women would say.
*  How come we have to...
*  I mean, you hear that all the time.
*  How come...
*  Society requires us to do 1,000 squats a week.
*  They're right.
*  This mook over here, he doesn't have to do anything.
*  And he's still pulling.
*  But the response to that would be,
*  you don't even have to be rich.
*  If you're hot and you're a woman,
*  you just have to be nice.
*  Yes.
*  A guy who's hot, good luck.
*  What are you going to get out of that?
*  You ain't getting shit out of that, stupid.
*  Go get a goddamn job.
*  Yeah.
*  No, you got to...
*  I think that's...
*  I read some study somewhere,
*  and I've put it out of my mind.
*  But I do remember there was an aspect of it
*  that did say, what do women see as an attractive element of a man?
*  And to this day, it's still the ability to provide.
*  Yeah.
*  Just like a million years ago.
*  Jeff Bezos.
*  Jeff Bezos, exactly.
*  Look at that smile she has on her face.
*  She's not bummed out to be with him.
*  Now, it would have been a different story if we were cavemen
*  and you had to rely on Jeff Bezos to provide.
*  Right.
*  That's not happening.
*  Right.
*  But yeah, I mean, it's...
*  Anyway, so Amazon's doing business with the new app store.
*  Yeah, that's kind of sneaky.
*  Yeah.
*  And TikTok's a Chinese company already.
*  Right.
*  And now...
*  And there's some talk, I mean, they've been making efforts
*  to limit the ability for TikTok to do business.
*  Really?
*  I think the US military has instructed all personnel to stay off of TikTok
*  or not to use TikTok.
*  Whoa, really?
*  Yeah.
*  Again, because of the same concern.
*  The whole idea is this platform, because...
*  These companies can argue all they want to
*  that they're independent from the Chinese authorities.
*  But ultimately, if the Chinese authorities knock on their door and say,
*  we would like access to your database because we want to hoover up
*  all the information about every US military person that's stationed wherever,
*  or they're going to do it.
*  They're trying to get one of the top TikTok executives in here.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Interesting.
*  Not really.
*  Yeah.
*  Not really interesting at all.
*  Not interesting to me.
*  So it's not happening?
*  No.
*  No.
*  Fuck you.
*  No.
*  I don't even understand TikTok.
*  I mean, I know the kids use it, kids like it, I guess.
*  Look at this.
*  Make TikTok videos.
*  It's considered a cyber threat.
*  Lieutenant Colonel Robin Ocha, an Army spokeswoman, told military.com,
*  we do not allow it on government phones.
*  There you go.
*  Look at that.
*  Cyber threat.
*  An effective tool for reaching young people of generation...
*  How old is Generation Z?
*  They're 12.
*  What is that?
*  My daughter is 11.
*  It's fucking all about TikTok.
*  She's teaching me TikTok dances.
*  I'm learning TikTok dances.
*  That looked good, actually.
*  That was a good move.
*  You'd blow up if you did some.
*  TikTok dances?
*  I'm not trying to blow up, bro.
*  No.
*  But my daughter, literally, she thinks it's hilarious.
*  She's teaching me TikTok dances and we practice for like fucking half an hour.
*  But what the hell is it?
*  Is it just another version of...
*  It's like little videos.
*  Okay.
*  Little videos.
*  But my 11-year-old's really into it.
*  Her friends all think it's hilarious.
*  I was going to say, I drive Sligo to his basketball practices and occasionally
*  there's two or three other knuckleheads in the car and that's all they're doing,
*  is they're talking about comparing TikTok videos.
*  How weird.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I can't.
*  I can't.
*  I'm too busy.
*  I'm not interested.
*  That's where YouTube started.
*  I was just like cat videos until it was...
*  Then it was 15-minute videos and now it's whatever it is.
*  So you think I should jump on board, Jayden?
*  I was just saying it's...
*  You do think I should jump on board.
*  You should not jump on board.
*  Let me ask you this.
*  Isn't OnePlus, isn't that a Chinese company as well?
*  I don't...
*  Find out what that is.
*  OnePlus.
*  Because OnePlus is accepted, right?
*  I mean, OnePlus sponsors a lot of things.
*  They make really high-end phones as well.
*  How come they don't get the same kind of scrutiny?
*  I suspect they do.
*  It just hasn't hit the press.
*  I mean, TikTok blew up, I guess, as an app that kids like.
*  And so it became...
*  But I didn't realize...
*  Again, how old is Generation Z?
*  Is that like a 20...
*  I don't even know what that is.
*  It's below millennials.
*  It's like the next thing, whatever.
*  So it's below millennials.
*  Okay.
*  That's when we're really fucked.
*  That's when we really get to see the fruits of our labor.
*  How fucked up have we turned this culture?
*  Well, let's check out the 10-year-olds.
*  Let's see how ridiculous these kids are.
*  Not to disappear down a rabbit hole, but I agree.
*  I think we have no idea.
*  We have no idea what technology,
*  how it's going to impact in the long run.
*  We don't have enough of a test case yet.
*  And I can look at my kids and their...
*  And just within my little microcosm of my three little dudes,
*  their attention span and their ability to...
*  And you can see it impacting.
*  You can see it impact the way that they study,
*  the way that they learn, the way that...
*  Again, I'm not a Luddite,
*  but I don't know that we're doing ourselves any favors.
*  I don't think we're doing ourselves favors either.
*  And I don't think there's any way of pulling back from it.
*  There's no...
*  You could tell your kids to pull back.
*  You could maybe get your friends' kids to pull back.
*  But culturally, no one's pulling back from this stuff.
*  They're getting more and more immersed in their phones,
*  more and more immersed in apps and internet.
*  And the big thing is apps to me.
*  They all get on these little social media apps,
*  whether it's TikTok or whatever it is,
*  and they're all direct messaging
*  and looking at each other's stuff.
*  And it becomes a giant part of your life.
*  These kids, you look at their...
*  My daughter has friends that don't have
*  any restrictions on their phones.
*  My daughter has a time limit on her phone.
*  She's got one hour in the whole day.
*  Other than that, you're not...
*  You have to do that.
*  You have to do that.
*  But she's got a little friend that doesn't have any time.
*  And this little friend, you would think this girl...
*  Her fucking skin is growing onto this phone.
*  She never goes anywhere without this phone in her hand,
*  and she's always looking at it.
*  She can't talk to anybody for five seconds
*  without looking at her phone, checking TikTok, checking...
*  She's getting that from her parents,
*  or from people see that.
*  I mean, look at adults.
*  How many times have you sat in a restaurant
*  and everybody at the table staring at their phone?
*  Or you get into...
*  I got on the car rental bus today,
*  and I dropped my bag on the thing,
*  and I stood there, and I looked down at the bus,
*  and everybody was staring at their phone.
*  At least that's dead time.
*  You're just sitting on a bus waiting to get to those,
*  let's check my email real quick.
*  That makes sense.
*  That's not a bad time to use your phone.
*  Yeah, in the old days,
*  you'd start up a conversation with the guy next to you.
*  So, where are you from?
*  Omaha, huh?
*  No, you wouldn't.
*  Nevermind, I don't know where I was going with that.
*  You could, but then you'd wanna...
*  Yeah.
*  You wanna call Homeland Security.
*  But you know, do you see anything suspicious?
*  Yeah, this fucking guy talked to me on the bus.
*  Yeah, I know what that's all about.
*  He wanted the guy...
*  Something he referred to as a conversation.
*  That's my favorite.
*  If you see anything suspicious, call this number.
*  Everything's suspicious.
*  Yeah.
*  See something, say something.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  What do you think about this,
*  have you seen this latest dispute
*  between Apple and the government?
*  What's the latest?
*  Well, you know, we had this shooting down in Pensacola.
*  And so, it was a Saudi soldier
*  who was down there for flight instruction
*  and killed three people in the classroom there
*  and finally taken out by deputies
*  because we don't allow our soldiers
*  to carry weapons on the base.
*  And anyway, point being is that when this happened,
*  he had two phones, Apple.
*  I think one was a five, one was a seven.
*  And so, the FBI got the phones.
*  They went to Apple, but asked for assistance
*  with the first one.
*  I don't know which phone they were asking for.
*  And Apple claims that, yeah, yeah, we provided assistance.
*  We gave them access to iCloud data backup
*  and some transactional records.
*  You know what they were asking for.
*  And then they went to Apple, I think just a week ago or so
*  with a request for assistance with the second one.
*  And they subpoenaed Apple a couple of days later.
*  So, you know, we need assistance in getting into these phones.
*  And still the same problem that they had,
*  you know, three or four years ago,
*  the San Bernardino shooting.
*  Yes.
*  And so, we had that big kerfuffle
*  where they were saying, look, Apple's not assisting.
*  They're not helping us get into this.
*  Government had to go to, as it turns out,
*  to an Israeli forensics group,
*  spend a lot of money to get cracked into these phones.
*  Anyway, so Bill Barr, the attorney general came out
*  just yesterday, past couple of days,
*  and he's been lambasting Apple saying,
*  you know, you're hampering this investigation.
*  You're not helping us in terms of
*  dealing with this terrorist incident.
*  And Apple saying, you know, what the fuck,
*  we are providing some assistance.
*  So we're back in that same thing that we were in
*  four years ago where you got this battle over access
*  and pushing an investigation forward
*  and the concern over privacy.
*  What did they want that Apple's not willing to provide?
*  Well, they want access to the phones.
*  You know, the idea was initially they were trying to get
*  backup, sorry, a back door that could be used
*  by law enforcement to get into the iPhone.
*  So you see it here, Trump wants Apple to unlock
*  the Pensacola shooter's iPhones.
*  Here's why it won't.
*  What is the, first of all, this is CNN,
*  which is fake news.
*  Oh, fake.
*  It's all fake news.
*  Faux.
*  It says, we have always maintained
*  there's no such thing as a back door just for the good guys.
*  Back doors can be exploited by those who threaten
*  our national security and the data security
*  of our customers, Apple added.
*  Today, law enforcement has access to more data
*  than ever before in history.
*  So Americans do not have to choose between
*  weakening encryption and solving investigations.
*  We feel strongly encryption is vital to protecting
*  our country and our users' data.
*  Yeah, but I don't understand, like, what are they looking
*  for that they won't let these guys find?
*  It's one thing that, like, back doors,
*  but I'm not talking about a back door.
*  I'm talking about, like, there should be a way
*  that they can get into the phone, right?
*  There should be a way that you can,
*  not just the iCloud backup, but you could open up the phone
*  and do it with, like, the Apple should have, like,
*  some skeleton key or something like that.
*  Well, that's what they're saying they're not gonna provide.
*  They're not gonna provide a software solution
*  to allow them access to get into these phones.
*  But what else could he have on his phone
*  if it's iCloud backed up?
*  Like, an iCloud backup is essentially your phone,
*  but it's in the cloud.
*  Right, but you can also turn that off.
*  So if you...
*  But have they turned it off?
*  Has he turned it off?
*  I don't know the details of that, but I would suspect so.
*  But there's other data that you can access from that phone
*  that would be relevant to this.
*  Now, you know, I tend to, in this situation,
*  I tend to side with Apple.
*  I understand the attorney general, you know,
*  his responsibility is, you know, whatever,
*  protecting American citizens.
*  So, okay, he's gonna have this position.
*  But, you know, Apple's basically saying,
*  look, we're not going to break the terms of our contract
*  with all the people that have iPhones
*  where we're providing them with privacy.
*  And they're also, I think, saying to some degree,
*  look, yeah, we understand that criminals can use encryption.
*  Right, I mean, they do, right?
*  They take advantage of the encryption that's available
*  and the lack of access.
*  But so do millions of citizens who use the iPhones
*  just to keep their bank records
*  or whatever they have on there, right?
*  And so the encryption benefits everybody, in a sense.
*  Obviously, it benefits the criminals.
*  Now, you know, I think I also kind of side with Apple
*  at this point because, frankly, I think technology
*  has kind of made some of these arguments moot,
*  meaning that, you know, there are ways
*  to get into these phones now.
*  So the bureau or the government doesn't have to just go
*  to Apple and say, please let us in.
*  There was boxes that the police were buying
*  that would allow you to hack into phones, right?
*  There's several companies.
*  The companies that are allowing or the developing access
*  or ability to access these phones,
*  the competition's been increasing.
*  And what happens, you know, people get better at it, right?
*  And so they develop new techniques.
*  But then the problem is like bad guys can buy them.
*  So they can get ahold of your phone,
*  they can steal your phone from you,
*  and then open it up and then use your phone
*  to text people or get weird with you.
*  Yeah, and so then what are you saying?
*  Are you saying, okay, well, a company
*  that's got that access point,
*  like the Israeli company or some others,
*  several others out there,
*  Grey Shift and a few others that provide this.
*  So then you're relying on them
*  to control who they're selling to.
*  And some of these companies sell only to the government
*  and to whoever is DEA or, you know.
*  And so I guess the point being is that
*  I don't think the old arguments of even a few years ago
*  that says we can't get in, so we need Apple's assistance.
*  I think that's kind of going by the wayside.
*  And, you know, the government does have the ability
*  to get in there at this point.
*  So I'm not quite sure why they're picking a fight.
*  Again, I don't know all the details that, you know,
*  but I don't know why they're picking a fight.
*  Is it possible that they can't get in the phone?
*  Is that possible?
*  Because they're saying back doors can be exploited.
*  We're okay.
*  But if you give Apple a phone
*  and say, hey, I don't know the password to this.
*  Can you get in there?
*  Yeah, they can get in there.
*  Yeah, Apple can.
*  They don't want to hand over that ability of that software.
*  Because again, it's, I mean,
*  it's a commercial issue, right, for them.
*  Right, but shouldn't it be possible
*  if they don't want to hand over that software
*  that they could just open it for the government
*  and the government doesn't have to get the software?
*  Yeah, the government's made that argument to them before.
*  It doesn't, for whatever reason,
*  because I think in part it's the optic, right,
*  that says, okay, well, apparently Apple's willing to do this.
*  I think they just want to hold the line and say,
*  absolutely not, because I think they're, you know,
*  they're looking at this from, again,
*  from almost a pure commercial perspective.
*  I kind of understand that, but then I kind of say,
*  well, this guy's a fucking terrorist.
*  Yeah, you would think that, yeah.
*  A mass shooter.
*  Yeah, okay, I mean, yeah, you've got a contract
*  with all these people that says, okay,
*  I'll protect your privacy.
*  But you think that would be, you know,
*  you're abdicating your ability to hold them to that contract
*  if you go out and shoot a few people.
*  Is the guy still alive, the shooter?
*  No, no.
*  Okay, so what's the fucking problem?
*  He doesn't have any privacy, he's dead.
*  It's a good point.
*  Open up the phone.
*  Yeah, it's just, I just find it interesting.
*  We're back having that same argument
*  that we had a few years ago, right, and we haven't,
*  and I think, like I said, I'm not sure why Barr
*  is pushing this argument necessarily the way he is.
*  I mean, I get what his position has to be,
*  given his job as Attorney General,
*  but I think we're past that point.
*  I think there's hacking solutions
*  that are legitimately available through forensics groups
*  that have been developing these things
*  that can assist the government to do this.
*  So I just found it, I found it interesting.
*  It is interesting, because it's like,
*  I understand that Apple does not want to open up
*  too much to the government's demands.
*  And if they do, look, we don't have a tyrannical government,
*  but what if we did?
*  I mean, like, what's going on with China and Huawei?
*  It's like very similar.
*  If Apple sort of opens up the door to the government
*  and they slide right in and start really using
*  Apple's software in their phones to manipulate people
*  and access data that they really shouldn't have access to,
*  people that aren't under investigation,
*  and just like, it opens up the door
*  to all sorts of other weird possibilities, I think.
*  Yeah, well, yeah, and it goes back
*  and it starts to feed that belief that, you know,
*  the government's spying on everybody.
*  The reality is, they neither have the resources
*  or the interest, frankly,
*  or the ability to spy on everybody.
*  Well, this is what I always say to people, like,
*  who's spying on you?
*  There's another person, so there's one person
*  that just spies on you all day.
*  So imagine, there's 300 million people in this country,
*  there's 300 million spies spying on those 300 million people.
*  Is that what's going on?
*  You got one target, that's all you do all day long,
*  is watch one person.
*  But then there's the thing about them collecting data,
*  like the NSA collecting data
*  and collecting all your phone calls,
*  collecting all your text messages.
*  You know, it's bigger threat is Amazon or Google or,
*  you know what, you turn on your Samsung TV,
*  you know what it's doing?
*  It's watching you.
*  Don't watch me.
*  Your TV's got the ability to watch you.
*  It's called Smart Interactivity.
*  So it's got a camera and the whole idea was,
*  well, we'll do this so that we can figure out
*  what you're watching and what you think of it.
*  So not only is it watching, but it could listen.
*  So, you know, it's the commercial side
*  that's collecting information, you know,
*  not necessarily for nefarious purposes,
*  they're collecting it for marketing purposes
*  to make more money, which is what they're in business to do.
*  But they're the ones that are hoovering up data, right?
*  That then leaks out because somebody hacks,
*  grabs all that information,
*  and then they use it for something nefarious.
*  Well, I get nervous when I hear about companies
*  like Facebook that are thinking about starting
*  their own cryptocurrency.
*  And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
*  Are you gonna have your own Bitcoin?
*  I'm not a not believer, but I'm not invested in it.
*  It's not like something I'm,
*  I had a guy on several times, Andreas Antonopoulos,
*  who's a Bitcoin expert, very, very bright
*  and interesting guy, and I really enjoyed talking
*  to him about it, but he's all in.
*  Like he does all his banking with Bitcoins,
*  pays his rent with Bitcoin, gets paid with Bitcoin,
*  everything is Bitcoin with him.
*  And, you know, he's loved by the Bitcoin community
*  and all this different stuff.
*  But at the end of the day, I just don't totally
*  understand how you can have so many of them.
*  Like how many cryptocurrencies are there?
*  And then if you don't have so many of them,
*  well, who's to say when you could stop making them?
*  Like-
*  Right, right, I mean, who's the arbiter to say,
*  no, that's legitimate, or that is not?
*  I don't know, I'm not, I don't know.
*  I fall in the category of I don't understand it.
*  I haven't, to be fair, I haven't taken the time
*  to understand it.
*  You can't think about everything.
*  This is my take on it, you can't.
*  You don't have enough time to think about everything.
*  So I'm letting that one play out on its own.
*  I'm gonna just sit back, and when it's 100%,
*  when it's 100% all in, when everybody's like,
*  look, Bitcoin is, it's just like money.
*  Yeah. Okay?
*  But until then, and they kind of predicted
*  it was gonna be just like money quite a few years ago,
*  and it never really did hit that.
*  But you can buy some things with Bitcoin.
*  There's some companies that let you buy computers
*  with Bitcoin.
*  I'm sure there's a fair amount of transaction
*  that goes on from what I understand,
*  but again, I don't understand,
*  I don't understand how it's backed necessarily.
*  I'm sure I'll probably get all sorts of comments now,
*  like you're a fucking idiot,
*  should be heavily involved in Bitcoin,
*  but I buy gold bars and, you know.
*  Gold's real.
*  Planned them out in the backyard.
*  They've been killing people for gold forever.
*  Exactly. That's legit shit.
*  Yeah, yeah, that's the way I feel about it.
*  Gold and catheters, I'm stocking up on both.
*  Those are both gonna be really important in the future.
*  But gold is a weird one, right?
*  It's like, why are we still so invested
*  in this soft, shiny metal?
*  Like, you know, at all the shit that people need,
*  why gold?
*  I don't even like it as jewelry.
*  I think it's kind of tacky.
*  Yeah, yeah, when I met my wife,
*  I was still wearing a gold chain from my old Miami vice days.
*  Yeah, she still doesn't let me forget that.
*  Yeah, it was pretty sweet.
*  It wasn't like flavor favor or anything.
*  It wasn't big and chunky, but it was,
*  I thought it was, I thought it was understated.
*  Was like a herringbone sort of one?
*  It was like a Greek key thing, you know.
*  Greek key thing, nice.
*  I lived out in that part of the world for a while.
*  So anyway, it was explained to me
*  that it wasn't as hip as I thought it was at the time.
*  And so I put it away with all my other gold jewelry.
*  And my boys will fight over for it when I'm dead.
*  Yeah, women will let you know.
*  They'll clean you up.
*  They'll go, hey, hey, hey,
*  you gotta stop with that stupid shit.
*  Like, I thought that was a, I thought I'm looking fly.
*  Yeah, oh my God, yeah.
*  I walked out the other day,
*  we were getting ready to go to some function,
*  and I come walking down the steps,
*  it was a casual thing, right?
*  And I thought, okay, so.
*  And I'm not a really,
*  I'm not a naturally social person in the sense
*  that I don't like to go to big gatherings of people.
*  I mean, I like going out to a dinner
*  or just to hang out for drinks with small,
*  six, eight people that I know, right?
*  And I know I'm gonna, this is where we're going.
*  I don't have to walk into a crowd
*  and go from little group to little group
*  having some small conversation.
*  I'm not good at it.
*  So but we're going to one of these things.
*  So I think in my mind, I thought I just have, okay.
*  So anyway, I come walking down the steps,
*  and I'm wearing a cardigan.
*  And my wife is walking up the steps
*  to get something she forgot upstairs.
*  And she stops on the stairs and she looks.
*  And so as I'm coming down the stairs,
*  I see her stop down there and she's staring at me.
*  I'm thinking, what?
*  And now I thought, I like this cardigan.
*  I bought it in the shop.
*  I thought, this looks pretty good.
*  I thought it had like a Matthew McConaughey vibe to it.
*  And she's staring at me like, what the fuck is that?
*  What color is it?
*  What color is it?
*  It's gray, it's a nice gray.
*  Can you pull up a picture of a gray cardigan, please?
*  I wanna get an image in my mind where you look like.
*  A picture of Matthew McConaughey in a cardigan.
*  Somebody must have Googled that.
*  No, I think that's-
*  Does he have cardigan wear?
*  Is he a big cardigan wearer?
*  That was the word, because I thought,
*  okay, I'm being pretty chill here.
*  That was another word I got from my kids.
*  And I just thought that it was presenting the right vibe.
*  I'm going to a party.
*  I'm casual and relaxed.
*  I'm gonna be, I don't know what I was thinking.
*  Anyways, she made me go upstairs and change it.
*  Damn, she made you.
*  Well, yeah.
*  And this is my second go around, and I've learned
*  that I'm not as smart as I used to be.
*  Look at that.
*  Look, see, that's what I'm talking about.
*  But that's when he was in Dallas Buyers Club.
*  Hey, well, you wanted a cardigan.
*  Yeah, no, that's what I'm talking about.
*  Jesus Christ, look at that.
*  That was when he was really sick.
*  That fucking guy has never looked the same again
*  since he lost all that weight for that movie.
*  He's been drawn out since then.
*  That's gotta be so devastating for your system
*  to put yourself through that kind of shit.
*  I think it must be worse in gaining weight.
*  Oh, it's way worse.
*  Look at his face, man.
*  I mean, he looks like a dead man.
*  God damn, he knocked out of the park in that movie, though.
*  He did, it was a great movie.
*  I hope he got paid well enough for it.
*  You can't, there's not enough money in the world
*  to make you lose that much weight.
*  You know, the worst one, though, was the mechanic.
*  Not the mechanic, the machinist with,
*  what the fuck's his name?
*  Christian Bale, yeah.
*  Christian Bale, he did the most horrific weight cut.
*  I've never seen anybody that skinny in a movie.
*  I mean, he was legitimately days before death.
*  Oh, God.
*  Yeah, look at that.
*  Look at what he looked like.
*  I was a toy, I was a toy.
*  That's a computer rendering.
*  There you go.
*  Yeah, and then he was Batman, like six months later,
*  and he got on the fucking Mexican supplements.
*  It's that back and forth, it's that back and forth
*  that'll throw your body in.
*  Terrible, terrible for you.
*  If you can maintain a kind of a consistent weight.
*  Look at that, though, Jesus Christ.
*  That's gotta be, there's gotta be some shopping
*  in there, Photoshopping.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  If you see the movie, man, he was eating an apple
*  and a can of tuna a day, that's it.
*  That was all he was eating.
*  And what happens then is your body starts eating itself.
*  And so look how he looked in Dick Cheney.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  He got real fat to play Dick Cheney.
*  Damn, that's like Bert Kreischer fat.
*  That's fat as fuck, look at that.
*  That's a lot of fat right there.
*  Yeah.
*  God damn.
*  Well, yeah, he's dedicated to his craft.
*  But here's the thing, the movie sucked.
*  So it's like you almost kill yourself
*  for a movie that sucked.
*  Did you see The Joker?
*  Yes.
*  What'd you think?
*  Fantastic.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It's weird how it's really drawn out both sides,
*  nobody's sort of like agnostic about it.
*  It either sucks or it's great.
*  That's what I keep getting those same responses.
*  It's a great movie, but it's disturbing as shit.
*  But there's a lot of weird stuff to it, right?
*  It's like, it's almost celebrating the idea
*  that the system is broke.
*  We're just gonna fucking shoot everybody who's rich
*  and light everything on fire
*  and let these fucking mentally ill people
*  not take their medication and just run things.
*  And he was, Joaquin Phoenix, first of all,
*  he's on another level.
*  Like his portrayal, he's always been an amazing actor.
*  But that movie, boy, they created a work of art
*  with that character.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I mean, it's just, you bought into it,
*  hook, line, and sinker that he was this crazy fuck.
*  And when, spoiler alert, when he shoots Robert De Niro,
*  there's scenes in that movie that make you just go, wow.
*  I will say this though.
*  My favorite Joker has always been Cesar Romero, right there.
*  There he was.
*  Oh, the Batman TV show?
*  Yeah, from the TV show.
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, hands down.
*  Really?
*  Oh, well, yeah.
*  I mean, I'm fairly old school.
*  That's terrible.
*  He does look pretty goddamn crazy there.
*  You know, he.
*  Ah, damn, he looks pretty good there.
*  I'm taking it back.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Not bad.
*  He kinda, you know, he sort of, that was it.
*  Heath Ledger's my favorite.
*  Yeah, yeah, Heath Ledger was good.
*  He was great too.
*  Jared Leto couldn't, yeah.
*  He can go pound Sam with that character.
*  But the Joker's got Oscar nominations, right?
*  I think.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I think he got a bunch.
*  Yeah, he's not the best actor.
*  I watched that Suicide Squad, the Jared Leto one,
*  it was like, oh, it's just a little too stylish.
*  Did you see the new one he's in?
*  He's playing Morbius, who's a vampire,
*  and he's in a Marvel movie now.
*  No, give me a picture.
*  Let me see what you got here.
*  Yeah, it's, look good.
*  Marvel's like, every movie's a Marvel
*  or a DC Comics movie nowadays.
*  He getting upset?
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  I wish I had a piece of the action, but still.
*  I remember Morbius.
*  Oh, this is Jared Leto playing Morbius.
*  Yeah, he kinda skipped through.
*  Wow.
*  Gets superpowers and.
*  So he becomes a vampire?
*  Yeah, yeah, he's like a guy who is dying,
*  had a blood disease, and he goes like,
*  one last thing to figure it out,
*  and I guess the vampire, the bats, helped him.
*  Wow.
*  Got some sort of power from the bats.
*  This is crazy.
*  He comes back jacked.
*  Yeah, and he starts fucking people up.
*  Woo, I like it.
*  When does this come out?
*  I think the summer?
*  Come on.
*  They just put the trailer out the other day,
*  so I don't remember the exact time I had to stay here.
*  I had no idea that bats had that ability,
*  but okay.
*  They don't, bro.
*  It's a movie. Oh, it's a movie.
*  Oh, I get it, I get it.
*  In theaters this summer.
*  All right, fine.
*  I'm in.
*  I'm all in, Jared, I take it back.
*  We had bats in our attic, believe it or not.
*  We had bats in our attic in Idaho.
*  Really?
*  Well, I'm sitting outside on the porch one day.
*  I know, again, I'm sorry about this,
*  but I'm sitting out on the porch,
*  and I look up, and it's the sun setting,
*  and this thing flies out from the top of the roof.
*  We got like this four-story brick place,
*  and out comes this thing, and then another one,
*  then another one.
*  We got bats flying out because it's getting dark,
*  and they're coming out of our attic.
*  So I'm thinking, you gotta be kidding me.
*  So we went to a wildlife specialist who came over,
*  and he kind of staked out the place a couple of nights,
*  figured out what the story was with him,
*  and we eventually got rid of the bats.
*  You had to hire a wildlife specialist?
*  Yeah, to get rid of them.
*  Why didn't you just get a tennis racket?
*  No, no, well, there's baby bats, you know?
*  And the kids didn't want to hurt the baby bats,
*  and so we had to wait for the baby bats
*  to grow a little bit, and then-
*  And then whack them?
*  No, then whack them.
*  Then you shoot them with your airsoft pistol.
*  But the interesting thing about bats,
*  they fly out, they drop down and fly out,
*  but if you stop their ability to go straight back
*  into the hole, they can't get back home.
*  So you create a situation, because they can't dip down
*  and then fly up and then go in.
*  They have to come straight in, straight at that.
*  This is fascinating, bad stuff.
*  But if I had known that they could create
*  that sort of super-power ability,
*  I would have kept a couple of them around.
*  But then you stay alive forever, you don't want that.
*  No, no.
*  There's a crazy story about a guy who was,
*  I don't remember where he was,
*  but a bat flew by and hit his hand, just hit his hand,
*  and apparently the bat had rabies,
*  and he died of rabies, like two weeks later.
*  Seriously.
*  Yeah, apparently rabies is one of those things
*  where if you get bit by something that has rabies,
*  they gotta get you in right away.
*  I mean, they gotta get you in right away,
*  and once it takes hold, you're fucking dead.
*  It's 100% lethal.
*  But they can get you if you get in right away,
*  but he didn't even know anything was wrong.
*  He didn't have a visible sign on his hand.
*  Bat flew into the hand of a British Columbia man
*  who died of rabies infection.
*  Yeah, so this thing, it just flew into his hand
*  and left a small cut.
*  He was a 21-year-old kid on Vancouver Island.
*  Good God.
*  Health authorities confirmed that the patient
*  was outdoors in broad daylight
*  when the nocturnal creature struck his hand and flew away.
*  He wasn't doing anything risky.
*  They would put him in a position
*  that would you encounter bats, Dr. Boone, Bonnie Henry
*  of BC's Chief Provincial Health Provider.
*  This is an incredibly unfortunate, strange circumstance
*  for this young man and his family.
*  Okay, so no visible puncture or scratch marks.
*  Because apparently they can be microscopic.
*  Yeah, the cuts.
*  So he developed the symptoms of rabies
*  six weeks after the exposure.
*  So it's just as well I didn't send the kids up
*  to take care of the bats is what you're saying.
*  Exactly, exactly.
*  All right, I get it.
*  He'd been driving and he pulled over the side of the road
*  when a bat flew into him.
*  What the, that's like a horror movie.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, really is.
*  At a final destination, like he got missed.
*  Right, like if a bat came back.
*  I mean to be fair, it's not a very interesting horror movie
*  but it's the idea behind it.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  It would only be interesting if it was like
*  World War Z type shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Just started.
*  But that's kind of like what rabies is to animals.
*  Rabies turns animals into these sick,
*  really aggressive creatures that want to infect you
*  with whatever they're infected with.
*  They want to bite you.
*  Yeah, raccoons.
*  You remember as a kid though,
*  it was always, the rabies thing was always,
*  you don't want to get rabies
*  because you got to go in for these series of shots
*  in your stomach.
*  I always remember that.
*  That was always the story.
*  Why the stomach?
*  I don't know.
*  It was like, you know,
*  don't accept apples on Halloween
*  because there'll be a razor blade.
*  It was just sort of like this thing
*  that you always heard as a kid.
*  You're going to get these shots in your stomach
*  so stay away from raccoons.
*  Yeah, whatever.
*  Worldwide, only five or six people
*  have survived a rabies infection.
*  Holy shit.
*  Those are the people you got to go to
*  when the zombies come, right?
*  You got to find those people
*  and harness their blood.
*  BC is home to 17 species of bats
*  with 10 species found in Metro Vancouver.
*  Wow.
*  Risk from rabies and bats is everywhere in BC.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  13% of bats tested positive for rabies.
*  13%!
*  I always thought of British Columbia
*  as a really nice place to be.
*  But that's in the province.
*  Amongst bats in the wild,
*  the rate is about 1%.
*  You got a fucking horrible infestation up there, BC.
*  Get your shit together.
*  What are they doing up there?
*  I'm coming up there at 420.
*  Isn't Prince Harry and Meghan,
*  aren't they going to Vancouver?
*  We should tell them about the bat thing.
*  We should.
*  It won't go.
*  They're not going.
*  I forgot to post that my shows are for sale.
*  I did, but not today.
*  They're for sale right now.
*  I'm doing Vancouver on 420.
*  I hope I don't get rabies.
*  Nice.
*  You know when you pass through,
*  you get to Vancouver,
*  you kind of pass through,
*  sort of boisy, maybe.
*  Well, not really.
*  Not from here.
*  No, you don't.
*  I'm flying.
*  I'm not driving.
*  Shit would take days.
*  What are we on, a wagon train?
*  Don't you travel in an RV?
*  Do your shows?
*  Always, yes.
*  Like fucking Chevy Chains and family vacation.
*  A truckster, family truckster.
*  Bert takes a goddamn tour bus everywhere.
*  Bert has a tour bus with his face all over it.
*  Crazy, crazy asshole.
*  Have you ever driven across the country?
*  Yes, when I was a little kid.
*  It's a long, long, long, long time ago.
*  I don't enjoy that kind of wasted time.
*  Yeah.
*  I would like to go.
*  Not even with the kids getting an RV and driving.
*  No, they would go crazy.
*  My kids would beat me to death.
*  Shut up, kids.
*  I'm driving.
*  They would go, we're not going any further.
*  I think it would be interesting if you had like an agenda,
*  like if you're gonna go to Grand Canyon,
*  then you were gonna go to Zion National Park.
*  You had a bunch of different things to do.
*  You had months of time,
*  and you can make your way across the country,
*  but just to drive for fucking five days
*  straight across the country,
*  that can eat a bag of dicks.
*  I'm not interested in that.
*  That's boring.
*  I think you're right.
*  Going to a national park in Yellowstone, for example,
*  anybody who hasn't been to Yellowstone,
*  go to Yellowstone.
*  It's incredible.
*  Don't go into summertime, but go.
*  But I've tried to convince my wife
*  that it's a good idea to get an RV,
*  drive and spend a couple of weeks with the kids.
*  And she looks at me like I'm wearing a cardigan.
*  It's that same look I get.
*  Well, it seems like a good idea,
*  but if it was a really good idea,
*  I think more people would be doing it.
*  I think once you actually start doing it,
*  you're like, what am I doing here?
*  I'm just sitting down all day.
*  My back's killing me.
*  The kids are on screens the whole time.
*  When are we gonna be there?
*  When are we gonna be there?
*  Are we there?
*  How much more time?
*  Stop touching me.
*  Stop hitting me.
*  Stop eating.
*  Stop hitting each other.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Well, if you're watching screens too,
*  that's not good for a kid to be watching screens
*  eight hours a day, all day,
*  just driving across the country
*  while they're playing with their iPads.
*  Yeah, well, you gotta take that away from them.
*  Going back to that other thing we were talking about.
*  Yeah, but then what are they doing?
*  Staring out the window?
*  Then they wanna talk to you.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Yeah, I know, right?
*  Talk to me about TikTok dances.
*  That's what I'm doing.
*  You know you're heading that direction.
*  I know a couple weeks from now,
*  somebody's gonna send me a TikTok of you dancing.
*  Trust me.
*  Okay.
*  Trust me, that's not happening.
*  There's a lot of guys who swear
*  by that tour bus life though.
*  They like it.
*  They're like my friend Sturgill.
*  Sturgill Simpson, he travels with a tour bus.
*  He said he would rather spend the whole day
*  in a tour bus than an hour on a plane.
*  Like if he's gonna go from one place to the other.
*  He goes, it's like a living room.
*  Like you just sit down and relax.
*  And so him and his band, they just chill.
*  They just hang out in this tour bus
*  and smoke a little devil's cabbage.
*  And kick back and relax.
*  Yeah, I can see that.
*  I haven't spent most of my life in airports.
*  I get the idea behind it.
*  You're right, it is a time suck.
*  Getting from point A to point B.
*  But this country is pretty amazing.
*  And there's a lot to see.
*  There's so much to see.
*  And we tend to overlook that fact.
*  And the Europeans always wanna make fun of us
*  because 90% of Americans don't have passports.
*  Then you point out, well have you driven across Texas?
*  Have you been out west?
*  Have you done these things?
*  Is it that many don't have passports?
*  I think it's a high number.
*  90%?
*  Yeah, really?
*  The percentage of US citizens that do not own a passport
*  or do not have a passport.
*  I have a feeling it's coming up soon.
*  What's interesting, you didn't even use to need one
*  to get to Canada or Mexico.
*  You used to be able to just have a driver's license.
*  Get right across.
*  We had a nice friendly agreement with everybody.
*  Yeah, you just jump across the river.
*  Yup, not anymore.
*  And you can find your uncle.
*  Now, what is that whole wall thing going up?
*  Apparently not.
*  I don't know where the wall stands.
*  Well, what the wall is,
*  it's a great little parkour set up for these Mexican dudes
*  who know how to climb them.
*  Excellent.
*  Percentage of the Americans with passports.
*  Oh, it's rising.
*  Oh, okay.
*  All right, I take it back then.
*  Wow, it's more than 40%.
*  Wow.
*  That's interesting.
*  I mean, it used to be true.
*  Yeah, look at the 1989.
*  It was fucking nobody.
*  What was happening in 89?
*  Look in 1989.
*  It's like literally less than 5%.
*  Maybe that's what I was thinking.
*  Maybe I'm stuck in 89.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought that's, yeah.
*  That's a...
*  Because the music was great back then.
*  So maybe that's why I'm reliving my 80s.
*  Is that the Reagan days, 89?
*  I think that's Reagan.
*  Wasn't Reagan president back then?
*  Bush? Bush.
*  Bush.
*  Yes, no one wanted to travel.
*  Is that 88?
*  Maybe, right?
*  Maybe no one wanted to travel
*  because they were worried about the Russians.
*  I don't know.
*  88 was when I was 20.
*  So I was 22.
*  What is up with that lady?
*  76% of people in England and Wales have a UK passport.
*  Okay.
*  I've got a UK passport.
*  Do you?
*  Yeah, I'm a dual citizen, so.
*  Look at you.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  How's that work?
*  Well, I'm a little upset with Prince Harry,
*  but other than that, it's working out really well.
*  Are you mad that he left the throne
*  or whatever the fuck he did?
*  No, I mean, you know...
*  Doesn't it make sense?
*  Well, it probably makes sense because, you know,
*  I don't know that he's the sharpest tool in the box
*  and he's probably thinking we can make a lot more money
*  if...
*  But they're not supposed to make any money
*  off of being a member of the royal family,
*  and yet they've trademarked, apparently,
*  sort of their brand,
*  the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.
*  They're not allowed to make any money
*  off of the royal family.
*  So they're given allotments, allowances,
*  living expenses.
*  How much?
*  It's a significant amount.
*  Look, they've got a house on the grounds of Windsor Castle
*  they're gonna continue to live in.
*  So I guess, here's my point,
*  they can do whatever the fuck they want,
*  but it would have been nice if they told their grandmother
*  so that she didn't have to find out about it on the news.
*  I thought that was kind of a...
*  The queen?
*  Spotted dick move, but yeah.
*  Spotted dick move.
*  The queen!
*  The queen!
*  She found out on Twitter
*  as Prince Harry lest the throne!
*  That is a remarkably accurate...
*  Thank you!
*  ...voice.
*  I've worked hard at it!
*  So she found out on TV,
*  but, you know, they want to be financially independent.
*  You know, they trademarked the Duke and Duchess of Sussex
*  in a variety of different ways, apparently,
*  and she's gonna go back to doing whatever she did.
*  It's that little American hussy he's hooked up with!
*  She's come to turn him into a Kardashian!
*  That's exactly what's gonna happen.
*  Yeah, well listen, they're already so popular,
*  all they need to do is start endorsing fucking makeup lines
*  and sneakers and watches and shit,
*  next thing you know, Ched's a millionaire.
*  Well she's got a massive following on Instagram,
*  which I suspect she wants to monetize that thing.
*  Well how much do you think they make?
*  Find out how much they make.
*  How much do they make from the royal family?
*  Might not be public.
*  Not public.
*  You think they hide that shit?
*  Well he got a...
*  He would know better than me to ask that.
*  I don't think they're hiding it, but...
*  You think they make a million a year?
*  Oh yeah, more than that.
*  I mean, look, he got, I think from his mother,
*  I think as an inheritance, he got some nine million dollars.
*  Prince Harry!
*  Yeah, and then she's probably worth about six million
*  on her own for her acting career.
*  I didn't know what she was acting in, but...
*  That little American hussy has ruined my prince!
*  Woo!
*  He's off to Vancouver, and the guy doesn't even know
*  there's a rabies issue there.
*  There's a fucking 13% bat rabies problem there, buddy.
*  Right.
*  Is that where he's gonna go?
*  He's gonna go to Vancouver?
*  They're moving to Canada?
*  Apparently they're looking to move part-time to Canada.
*  They're gonna start a reality show.
*  I guarantee you some creepy producer got a hold of them
*  and go, guys, listen, you're wasting your time
*  over here in England, it rains too much.
*  Yeah, what are you gonna do over here?
*  Look, you're pissing away the money she's worth.
*  Yeah.
*  He's probably thinking, yeah, I wanna get out of this.
*  But then he came out and said,
*  well, we're not gonna move to the States.
*  Supposedly, he came out and said, this is all,
*  I can't believe we sound like page six or something.
*  But he came out and said, you know,
*  we're not moving to the States until Trump is not president.
*  Trump is out of office!
*  Exactly.
*  Thank you, Prince Harry, at least for that!
*  Is this what the Queen gets,
*  but her grandchildren's money isn't public?
*  Oh my God, the Queen received $58 million free of tax
*  from the sovereign grant in the 2016-2017 fiscal year.
*  What kind of goofy shit is that?
*  They give them.
*  But where are they next year?
*  $58 million.
*  $103 million.
*  $103 million in the next year.
*  It's good to be Queen.
*  To help finance the extensive renovation
*  of Buckingham Palace, we need more money!
*  The palace is pretty impressive.
*  But imagine being a poor person
*  and you find out that the Queen,
*  who literally does nothing,
*  is making $100 million in a year.
*  Yeah, see, this is why I don't think I could ever
*  say anything negative about the Queen.
*  I think I got a tremendous amount of it.
*  I feel like she's grandma, but I do.
*  Because you have a dual citizenship.
*  Everybody's brainwashed over there.
*  Yeah, but she has been a remarkably consistent,
*  she's got a shit show of a family.
*  Thank you, Michael!
*  Thank you for standing up to me!
*  Exactly.
*  That hooligan Joe Rogan in his terrible internet show
*  would be illegal in my country!
*  I deserve that $100 million, you little fuck!
*  Think about all the public service she does.
*  Oh, she's amazing.
*  Well, that's incredible.
*  Just this alone, that should be worth a lot of money.
*  Well, think about it, each wave is now apparently
*  $103 million, that's a significant amount.
*  No, anyway, I don't know how we got down this one.
*  Prince Harry, they left.
*  Yeah, oh that's right, they left to go to,
*  I think, in Rabies Town.
*  So if she is making $100 million a year,
*  he's probably making 10, right?
*  It's a significant amount.
*  So I get it, okay, they wanna go,
*  again, who cares?
*  But they can't make money off the royal family.
*  They can't make money off the royal family,
*  off the royal brand.
*  So it's like, the idea is you're getting paid enough?
*  Just what a goofy system,
*  they just give them money for free to be a royal.
*  And the British taxpayers are saying,
*  like, what the fuck, we're gonna keep subsidizing them,
*  and they're gonna go to Canada,
*  and we're gonna keep paying them,
*  and they're gonna live part-time here,
*  and they're not gonna do any of the
*  representational work or whatever.
*  Why does that even make sense?
*  I don't know, you gotta show up at events.
*  Well, how about the other prince?
*  How about the other prince, the one that's Epstein's friend?
*  Oh, Andrew.
*  Andrew, yeah, that was...
*  What, first of all, how odd is that guy
*  when they're interviewing him and talking to him?
*  It's like, what?
*  McQueen kicked him to the curb very quickly.
*  Yeah, well, it's very strange.
*  What is your take on this whole Epstein thing?
*  First of all, can we just agree, look at that.
*  So, you sure she's 18?
*  Positive.
*  So you're telling me that, yeah, yeah.
*  She does not look 18.
*  She looks 16, are you sure?
*  You sure?
*  What a shit show that is.
*  Yeah, what a shit show.
*  So, let me ask you this right off the bat.
*  Well, I don't know what I'm gonna ask you.
*  He didn't kill himself, right?
*  I don't believe so.
*  Thank you.
*  No, no.
*  And you know me, I'm not a conspiracy guy, right?
*  I don't disappear down rabbit holes very often,
*  but no, I don't think there's any way in hell
*  he killed himself.
*  Michael Shermer, who's the head of Skeptics Magazine,
*  who doesn't believe anything,
*  found out that the tapes were missing
*  and that the fucking cameras didn't work
*  and that the tapes were deleted from the first,
*  accidentally deleted from the first time
*  he attempted suicide.
*  And Shermer's like, oh, this is a conspiracy.
*  Like, it was enough evidence that one of the biggest,
*  a professional skeptic, professional skeptic
*  doesn't believe anything.
*  There's no, there's just no,
*  there's no way I could be convinced that he offed himself.
*  No way.
*  So.
*  He knew too much.
*  And you know, it's astounding, but yeah,
*  what a shit show.
*  But hey, you know, nobody's gonna get
*  to the bottom of anything.
*  But that's a crazy one.
*  Like, they got him in the jail.
*  The guards are somehow or another getting in trouble,
*  so who knows what the guards are gonna say.
*  They might get suicided.
*  My favorite part was the guy they chose for his cellmate.
*  You see the fucking gorilla they chose for his cellmate?
*  Yeah, it reminded me of that Richard Pryor,
*  that old Richard Pryor movie.
*  I don't know if you remember that one.
*  So.
*  The guy, look at this fucking guy.
*  This giant goomba, this huge Italian ex-cop
*  who's a murderer and a drug runner.
*  I mean, this guy is built like a brick shithouse,
*  and this is Epstein's cellmate.
*  It's like, what?
*  Like, you can't even make this stuff up.
*  Says he never touched him.
*  Of course, why would I touch him?
*  Nicholas Tartaglione.
*  Yeah.
*  What does it say, timeline of events
*  in quadruple homicide, is that what it says?
*  Yeah, that's what it says.
*  Yeah, so this fucking guy, this giant.
*  Likes dogs, though.
*  Yeah, he loves dogs.
*  They keep him from all the people that he killed.
*  They bark when they're coming around,
*  you can grab your gun, it's a good move.
*  It's just crazy, there's so many pieces to the puzzle
*  that are so ridiculously obvious.
*  And then when you find out that Clinton flew with him,
*  at least 26 times.
*  Yeah.
*  26 times.
*  Yeah, I had no idea.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Jeffrey's a good guy.
*  No, it's just one of those things,
*  and again, I'm not a buyer on these sort of things,
*  but you look at the facts around
*  and you think there's no way in hell.
*  And that guy must know you.
*  You would've thought that Epstein
*  would've said to himself,
*  I'm gonna get killed here if I'm not careful.
*  Well, he probably didn't think it was ever gonna get
*  to the point where they were actually jailing him.
*  Because remember he had that deal
*  where he was on work release
*  so he could just do whatever he wanted
*  and fuck off for 16 hours a day,
*  then he had to check into the jail at night.
*  And who even knows what that means?
*  He might've checked in and just went home again.
*  And it seems like they had set something up for him
*  to make it very easy for him to be incarcerated
*  for what should be a pretty heinous crime.
*  I mean, he was-
*  You would think.
*  Sex with underage girls.
*  Right.
*  Sex trafficking.
*  Yeah, sex trafficking.
*  Not just him doing it.
*  I mean, just the extent to which.
*  And so yeah, but then you look at,
*  I forget what her name is,
*  the sort of the assistant, Giselle.
*  What is her name?
*  Gis-Lane?
*  Gis-Lane Maxwell.
*  How'd he say it?
*  What'd he say?
*  It has an S in it,
*  but I've heard it pronounced with the S or without.
*  So, Ghislaine or Gis-Lane.
*  Okay.
*  I don't know.
*  Ghislaine or Gis-Lane.
*  Whatever, G.
*  It's called a G-Rocker.
*  So G-Rocker's out there hiding in the bushes
*  in Columbia or something, right?
*  Where is she?
*  Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.
*  I mean, she must be,
*  you would assume they've deposed her at this point.
*  She must have something.
*  She must have some fucking kill switch
*  where if the shit goes down,
*  all the Clinton tapes come piling out
*  onto the fucking floor of Glenn Greenwald's house.
*  You would think,
*  I'm like, yeah, you brought it around to Glenn Greenwald.
*  Hey, Glenn, it's Bill.
*  Can we talk?
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe, you know what?
*  Maybe I should convince,
*  oh, there she is.
*  That's when she was at In-N-Out reading a book
*  on ex-CIA agents who have been murdered.
*  That's literally what she was reading a book on, right?
*  Wasn't that?
*  Yeah.
*  It was about CIA operatives and the murder.
*  So the idea was that what they said,
*  what people believe,
*  and there's many different versions of what people believe,
*  but look how many pictures she posed for.
*  It's so strange.
*  But what many people believe was that
*  what he was doing was compromising
*  a lot of these wealthy, powerful people
*  by getting video tapes of them hooking up with young girls,
*  including Prince Andrew, right?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  For whatever reason.
*  Have you heard of anything like this before?
*  Is this something that's been done in the past?
*  Not that I've heard of.
*  I mean, I'm sure it's,
*  anytime you see some freak show,
*  it's never the first time it's happened, right?
*  So you have to assume it's happened,
*  but to the degree that it's got this level
*  of celebrities and big-time names, I mean.
*  It works so well.
*  And I'm gonna tell you something after the show's over.
*  Tell you something after the show's over.
*  But-
*  You can just tell me, it's just you and me talking.
*  Shh.
*  If you whisper.
*  I hear you in my ears.
*  The North Koreans used to do that.
*  Sorry about that.
*  The North Koreans used to,
*  that was their phone security,
*  is they would get on the phone
*  when they had something really classified to talk about.
*  Did they whisper?
*  They would whisper.
*  Yeah.
*  So.
*  You gotta think, oh, okay.
*  That's hilarious.
*  We'll never figure that out.
*  That's really funny.
*  Really, that's how they did it?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Well, part of it was,
*  years ago, I think they just never believed
*  any Westerner could understand Korean.
*  I think that was kind of part of it,
*  was that they just believed we were all too stupid
*  or we were just so complicated
*  that we'd never be able to figure out
*  what they were saying in their own language.
*  That's the price you pay for being so insulated, right?
*  You don't really understand what's really going on
*  in the outside world,
*  because they don't really have the internet.
*  When was the last time we talked about North Korea?
*  It's been quite a while.
*  We just pushed that right off the front door.
*  But to get back, we can talk about North Korea,
*  but to get back to this Epstein thing,
*  is that a common strategy
*  that intelligence agencies would use
*  where they would try to compromise people
*  in order to get,
*  like what would be the benefit?
*  If the Mossad was doing that
*  and they were doing that and using,
*  that's the theory.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Yeah, it's a good point.
*  I'd say from an intel services perspective,
*  I mean, one thing I will say is the US,
*  and people's never gonna believe this
*  because I'm saying it,
*  they'll say, all right, it's bullshit.
*  But the US, the agency doesn't do that.
*  We don't use honey traps.
*  We don't do that sort of thing
*  because that sort of leverage,
*  it's always gonna head south on you.
*  And so we don't try to coerce somebody
*  in that sort of a relationship
*  that then we can take advantage of.
*  And yet other services do,
*  the Russians being one of them,
*  they do that all the time.
*  Israelis, yeah, they've had some very successful efforts
*  to do that.
*  And if you can, if you get somebody in that position,
*  it doesn't matter how they're compromising themselves,
*  whether you're putting themselves in
*  with like an Epstein situation
*  where suddenly you've got them,
*  you've got video of them with an underage person
*  or whether they've provided a document
*  that they shouldn't provide.
*  It's all this, the concept is always the same.
*  It doesn't matter what that action is.
*  You're getting them on the hook.
*  You're getting something that's leverageable over them.
*  And if they don't just go forward immediately,
*  say and turn around to their boss and say,
*  I'm guilty, did this, sorry,
*  then they're compromised.
*  And then you've got them.
*  As an Intel service, you've got them.
*  You can start reeling the hook in
*  because now you know that not only did they do something
*  to provide you with a document,
*  even if it wasn't on classified,
*  if I go to somebody,
*  if I'm developing a relationship with somebody,
*  some target overseas or whatever,
*  and I'm thinking, all right, now I'm exploring.
*  This person's got access.
*  They're in an interesting position, an interesting job,
*  and they've got access to information
*  that we wanna know that's priority target.
*  And then I wanna say, okay,
*  now I wanna develop a relationship a little bit.
*  Maybe I bump into the person at a few parties.
*  Maybe we're in the same parent-teacher organization,
*  whatever the shit is, right?
*  And our kids play on the same soccer team.
*  So then I go and I think, okay, what do I wanna do?
*  I wanna test the waters a little bit.
*  I'm not gonna say, hey, listen,
*  I understand you work at the foreign ministry here
*  in whatever country you happen to be in.
*  How about you give me some documents?
*  But instead, maybe it's something different.
*  Maybe they work at the foreign ministry.
*  Maybe they work at an aerospace business that's a target.
*  But you've developed a bit of a relationship,
*  and then you say, yeah, my kid's doing this school project,
*  and it's all about whatever, hypersonic flight.
*  You know that they work at some aerospace company,
*  do you have anything just on hypersonics?
*  You're not looking for anything classified.
*  You're just looking for a research paper
*  or a study or something.
*  And if they come back and say, yeah, you know what,
*  here, this is an interesting study.
*  Now that act alone, they're not giving you something
*  classified, but that act alone means something big.
*  It means they were taskable in a sense.
*  They responded to your request for information.
*  They're suckers.
*  Not suckers necessarily.
*  They could be an enormously smart person.
*  And smart people get, yeah, they get suckered into it.
*  I guess you could put it that way.
*  So anyway, then you go from there.
*  Then you ratchet it up slowly, bit by bit,
*  if you've got the timeframe to do it.
*  Maybe sometimes you've got a shortened timeframe
*  because there's a requirement to get something,
*  and you've got to accelerate the whole process.
*  Anyway, so the point being is it's still leverageable.
*  And Epstein was obviously getting leverage
*  on all these different people for whatever his purpose was.
*  What do you think, that's what the question was.
*  What could he possibly, a lot of them were scientists.
*  He went with a lot of celebrities.
*  There was heads of state.
*  I don't think he needed money.
*  Well, what was he doing?
*  I mean, maybe he just, who knows?
*  Maybe he got off on sort of being the kingpin
*  in this whole thing.
*  It's a good question.
*  It had to be funded, right?
*  So I mean, there had to be something valuable
*  they were getting from it.
*  I'm guessing.
*  I don't know.
*  It hasn't been spelled out to me.
*  I've tried to figure out the angle,
*  but I get the idea of you would have leverage
*  over these people, you'd have them in compromising
*  situations, and then they would do things for you.
*  But what would they do for you?
*  What is he getting Bill Clinton to do for them?
*  It's a good question.
*  Providing him with access, maybe he liked being close
*  to the seat of power, or maybe he liked being close
*  to what he thought was a royal family member.
*  Maybe, who knows?
*  Because it sounds like he had all the money he needed.
*  So maybe it was that sort of access that blew his skirt up.
*  I don't know.
*  It is interesting, but I don't think,
*  I mean look, it's just been kicked to the curb.
*  Obviously they're doing the trial, I guess, to some degree,
*  but I don't know where they stand in that trial.
*  Nothing's gonna happen.
*  Yeah, nothing's gonna happen.
*  We've already swept it under the rug,
*  and there's already new stories out
*  that have got our attention.
*  We forget about things so quickly today.
*  The news cycle is so fast.
*  When something happens, even something as ridiculous
*  as the Epstein case, where it's so obvious
*  that he was murdered, and then Michael Baden goes
*  on 60 Minutes and says this is consistent
*  with someone who has strangled.
*  I've never in all my years of seeing people hanged,
*  I've never seen them with these kind of fractures.
*  These fractures are indicative of strangulation.
*  And that is one serious-minded dude too, right?
*  Michael Baden.
*  Yeah, tremendous amount of experience.
*  He doesn't blow smoke up anybody's ass.
*  He's very measured.
*  And now obviously he was there on behalf of Epstein's brother.
*  But, you know, anyway, it's one of those things
*  where you think, what the heck?
*  I'm gonna put that down as something we should explore.
*  I wanna go visit that cop in jail.
*  See what he's probably got a fur-lined cell now.
*  Tagger Leone?
*  Yeah, he's got a giant 72-inch TV.
*  All the dogs with him.
*  Yeah, all the dogs there.
*  What's happening here?
*  He's got wire marks in his hands.
*  Tighten up on that.
*  I mean, if you're gonna get someone to strangle your cellmate,
*  that's the guy too.
*  I mean, he'd fucking do it in three seconds.
*  He's so big.
*  Yeah, you don't want somebody who's gotta take their time
*  because they can't exert enough pressure.
*  You want some Kevin Spacey dude strangling.
*  It's gonna take forever.
*  Can I hold still?
*  Want some big gorilla dude.
*  Yeah, okay.
*  Well, I tell you what, if this new series I'm doing
*  gets picked up for a second season,
*  well, I'm gonna recommend to the producers
*  they put the Epstein case on there.
*  Even though it's not quite in line with what we do.
*  You sent me a, let me afford it to Jamie.
*  Did you get it, Jamie?
*  So let's look at the trailer for this.
*  What is it called?
*  It's called Black Files Declassified.
*  And what is it based on?
*  The science channel, Discovery Science Channel.
*  And it's essentially, it's a series looking at,
*  there's something called the Black Budget, right?
*  Let's play the trailer.
*  Okay, yeah, let's do that.
*  Let's play the trailer.
*  Let's go to the clip.
*  And then we'll talk about it.
*  Let's go to the clip, ladies and gentlemen.
*  Black Files Declassified.
*  Wow.
*  Listen to that.
*  A top secret aviation program.
*  They will neither confirm nor deny
*  the existence of records.
*  Funded by a mysterious money trail.
*  There was a lot of thought into how we're going to hide
*  the various pots of money.
*  Could revolutionize flight.
*  Do you think that you'll see manned hypersonic flight
*  in your lifetime?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And unleash a new lethal technology.
*  Extremely high speed.
*  Extremely high speed, it's Mach 5.6.
*  That would make these cruise missiles almost impossible
*  to defend against.
*  Zero nine, eight, four, we have a splash.
*  Standby for PDA.
*  Every year, more than $90 billion is allocated
*  to clandestine government programs,
*  collectively called the Black Budget.
*  Each individual operation is a Black File.
*  I'm Mike Baker.
*  As a covert CIA operations officer
*  for over a decade and a half,
*  I supervised missions around the globe.
*  My security clearances gave me access
*  to many classified projects.
*  Now, I'm following the money trail
*  to the secrets hidden inside the Black Files.
*  Damn.
*  I'd watch that.
*  I'd watch that.
*  I'd watch that thing over and over again.
*  Well, all that kind of shit's fascinating to me.
*  Manned hypersonic flight, does that mean single?
*  One of our first episodes, yeah.
*  When you say manned hypersonic,
*  they used to have the Concorde, that was hypersonic, right?
*  No.
*  Wasn't?
*  No, hypersonic is, essentially anything over Mach 5
*  is hypersonic.
*  So what is?
*  And so we don't have, there's no manned hypersonic flight yet.
*  So the Concorde was the speed of sound.
*  Yeah.
*  And this is faster than the speed of sound.
*  Five times faster.
*  I mean, you're talking about a mile a second or so.
*  For a missile, a missile traveling.
*  So that's what, Russia just came out
*  and announced the deployment of a new hypersonic missile
*  or a weapon.
*  And that's where the war in space is going,
*  basically, isn't a hypersonic, mostly unmanned.
*  There's some effort to try to figure out,
*  can we create a manned vehicle?
*  It's really problematic.
*  Because you think about traveling that fast
*  and you think about what that means
*  for punching through the air and the heat
*  and the materials that are needed.
*  But as far as unmanned glide vehicles or whatever,
*  I mean, that's where a tremendous amount of resources
*  being put right now by the Russians, the Chinese, the US.
*  And it's pretty frightening
*  because we don't have any way to defend against it.
*  Like the one fellow I mentioned in that clip
*  is that if you think about a sort of a ballistic missile,
*  it's got a trajectory, right?
*  It goes up and it comes down.
*  Just like the Cold War days,
*  we had all the defenses set up
*  to intercept Russian missiles coming towards us.
*  Well, we knew what the path was going to be.
*  And so we were able to deploy a defense system against this.
*  The idea with hypersonic weapons is, you have no idea.
*  You've got almost no warning
*  and you'd have no idea what that trajectory is
*  for those weapons.
*  It's going so fast and it's adjustable.
*  So it's not just depending on a missile.
*  Ballistic missile goes up and it's gonna come down
*  and you know exactly what that path is going to look like.
*  So they can adjust it, like they can slow it down?
*  You can slow it down, you can change direction.
*  What?
*  Yeah, so you think about it, it's a big deal.
*  So one of our, I think it may be our first episode,
*  it's gonna be focused on hypersonics
*  and but there's a variety of other episodes in this thing.
*  But it's all looking at this idea
*  that the black budget exists, it does exist.
*  And there's each project, whether it is a project
*  to develop hypersonic flight,
*  in which the US government had that,
*  whether it's advanced aviation threat identification program,
*  whether it's the space force,
*  which has been actually around for a long time.
*  There's budgets that account for these programs
*  and they have to be hidden somewhere.
*  I mean, the government's gotta spend the money, right?
*  So the idea being, what started this thing off
*  was the idea that, well, what if you just,
*  literally just did follow the money
*  and try to figure out from the money trails
*  how they were developing these projects
*  and could you identify the various projects
*  that these pots of money go to?
*  And it turned out to be really, it's very interesting.
*  I'm subjective, of course, but it's pretty good.
*  And we don't have a specific air date yet.
*  They're being very mum about it,
*  but it'll be on Sunday nights
*  coming to a science channel near you soon.
*  So with these hypersonic missiles,
*  you can't judge from the path that it's gone so far
*  or where it's going.
*  Right, exactly.
*  Because they can steer them in real time?
*  Yeah, yeah, the idea being it's not following
*  a known trajectory,
*  it's not following a ballistic trajectory.
*  Fuck.
*  So it is, and it's,
*  it is the development,
*  the effort to try to develop manned hypersonic flight
*  has got a really fascinating history.
*  And particularly here in the US,
*  but we're not there yet.
*  That may not happen in our lifetime.
*  It's just because of the difficulties.
*  You talk about, I interviewed some terrific people
*  during the course of that,
*  which is the best part of this series
*  is being out from my perspective.
*  You travel around, you see all these interesting things,
*  you talk to these fantastic folks, right?
*  I mean, some credible people,
*  a former pilot for the old Blackbird program, right?
*  This guy strapped into this thing
*  and get up to the altitude,
*  on the edge of the atmosphere,
*  doing these overflights of Russia
*  and gathering, or wherever, and gathering intelligence.
*  And just the dangers involved in these aircraft,
*  these experimental aircraft that were being designed,
*  and the whole goal being eventually trying to work your way
*  towards this hypersonic manned flight.
*  These people are amazing, right?
*  And you start talking to some of them
*  and you realize what people are capable of,
*  if they can set aside their fear
*  and they have that risk appetite.
*  That's a funny way of putting it, risk appetite.
*  Yeah, well, I mean, they just don't think,
*  I mean, a test pilot doesn't think the way that you are,
*  well, maybe he thinks the way you do,
*  but not the way I do.
*  I mean, it's a, you talk to some of these folks, but.
*  Yeah, I know what you're saying.
*  But anyway, so, yeah, so that's what-
*  The first person, like the first person
*  who goes up in one of those things.
*  Forget about all the testing
*  and all the structural rigidity documents
*  and all the data and everything that's showing you,
*  this is absolutely safe, like it's not.
*  It's not, no, there's nothing safe about it.
*  And like that one fellow that I,
*  there was a little bit in the clip
*  where I asked this old guy,
*  looks like somebody's granddad, right?
*  Do you believe there'll be manned hypersonic flight
*  in your lifetime?
*  He says, this guy's, the story of this guy
*  testing experimental aircraft to try to get to that point,
*  and some of the things that he did,
*  and it's astounding.
*  When you look at him, you think you're not normal.
*  And I talked to his wife and she said,
*  yeah, it's interesting, she's been married to him forever,
*  but she says, one of the interesting things
*  you learn about being married to somebody like this,
*  a test pilot or somebody else in a position like that is,
*  you know, they don't process things the same way.
*  They don't necessarily have a lot of empathy
*  because they're just focused on this thing, right?
*  And they're not necessarily thinking,
*  well, I don't wanna go up there and die
*  because I'd be leaving my family behind and all, you know.
*  Yeah, it's not in the thought process.
*  Anyway, so there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
*  What do you think about all this stuff about,
*  I mean, the New York Times had articles about it,
*  there's Air Force test pilots have come out
*  talking about encountering flying saucers,
*  or unidentified flying objects,
*  particularly Commander Fravor,
*  who had that TIP track thing.
*  Yeah, what do you think about all that?
*  Yeah, we do, you know, I'm a shameless marketer,
*  we do an episode on that, on A-TIP,
*  on the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program.
*  And look, again, I always say the same thing.
*  I'm not a conspiracy guy,
*  I tend to be very cynical about everything,
*  but after talking to some of these folks,
*  including Fravor and a handful of others,
*  who were both pilots and also were involved
*  in the A-TIP program for the US government,
*  for the military, there's things out there
*  that we haven't been able to identify.
*  And I'm not jumping on the alien train, right,
*  but what I'm saying is that there are things
*  that extremely experienced pilots, military pilots,
*  with significant amounts of experience,
*  couldn't figure out, couldn't identify, right?
*  And so I'm certainly not gonna be smart enough to say,
*  okay, this is what it was.
*  Was it a foreign government's experimental aircraft?
*  I don't know, but what I do know is that the US government
*  took it seriously enough that they developed
*  their own internal program within the Pentagon
*  to try to sort out the wheat from the chaff, right,
*  and say, okay, what do we actually have to worry about?
*  In part because it's a national security issue, right?
*  If there is a aircraft or if there's something up there
*  that a military pilot sees, for instance,
*  that they can't identify, all right,
*  we have an obligation to figure out what that is,
*  because if it's a hostile foreign government's efforts
*  to develop craft that we don't know about
*  or propulsion systems we don't know about,
*  then yes, we should be working on that issue.
*  The problem has always been that once you talk about that,
*  then people immediately go, oh, aliens, huh?
*  Area 51, and it kind of gets dismissed,
*  but there was a much more serious effort than I knew about
*  before I started working on this thing.
*  And so I don't know, I think,
*  I've got an open mind about that.
*  It's like that old thing about how,
*  can we really be the only people out here?
*  Or life forms out here.
*  Eh, I don't know, that seems a little obscure
*  for me to believe.
*  It seems unrealistic.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  So, but-
*  When I like flavor, that's the thing.
*  When someone who's that rock solid comes out
*  and tells the story and he's not deviating from the story,
*  he's not a guy who's trying to make money,
*  he's just, and he doesn't have a history
*  of telling fantastic stories.
*  And he knew what it meant when he was gonna come forward
*  and talk about this, and you've got the gun cameras,
*  and you've got the radar operators
*  who also saw the same thing.
*  They saw it and they said it was actively
*  jamming their radar.
*  Which they say, what the fuck?
*  And then the way it moved from 60,000 feet
*  down to like 200 feet in like less than a second.
*  And no signs of any propulsion system.
*  Yeah.
*  No, there's several things about that that,
*  yeah, leave you scratching your head.
*  Again, I'm not making a case one way or the other.
*  The point of this is to, again,
*  is to kind of use the money trail as a way
*  to get inside some of these programs.
*  And then to the degree that you can talk about things
*  that are declassified.
*  Not necessarily trying to make a case.
*  We're not trying to say it is this or it is that.
*  But I think we're presenting a lot of interesting information
*  that, again, with this situation with flavor as an example,
*  you come away from it and you think,
*  okay, I'm not dismissing anything at this point.
*  It would be, I think, foolish to or anyway.
*  So interesting stuff.
*  But-
*  Was that ever anything that came up during your career?
*  No, no.
*  No, I was pretty much straightforward.
*  Pound the ground through some counterinsurgency operations,
*  counter narcotics, counterterrorism operations.
*  We never did any counter alien things.
*  So that must have been, that was a different operation.
*  That was on a floor we weren't allowed to go onto
*  at the headquarters.
*  It seems like if we had to admit it was real,
*  if it was something that was real
*  and we were being contacted on a regular basis
*  or at least semi-regular basis,
*  that would change the way everybody feels about everything.
*  Yes.
*  Remember when Reagan gave that speech?
*  Maybe, I think it was the United Nations.
*  He said to imagine how easily we would come together
*  if we were faced with a threat from an alien world.
*  And everybody was like, oh my God, he knows something.
*  The aliens.
*  He's about to spill the beans.
*  Yeah, that's what we were hoping.
*  All the faux dorks like myself.
*  Well, but think about it.
*  I mean, think if that did come out,
*  which is what part of the allure, right,
*  is the idea that the government's been keeping this from us
*  for all these years.
*  And you think about what that would mean,
*  not just obviously, oh my God, really?
*  There's something going on out there.
*  But then sort of that breakdown in trust,
*  not that it's not happening already
*  in terms of the government and its ability to play square.
*  But yeah, I mean, look, Area 51.
*  Area 51 was scouted out for use as an experimental test site
*  for aircraft and made perfect sense.
*  Well, then you get all these experimental aircraft
*  being developed out there
*  and flown some successfully, some not.
*  And locals see this shit,
*  locals being a fairly good sized region
*  because of the distance on these.
*  And it's understandable how you start getting
*  some of these stories.
*  But having said that, I sat down with Fravor, right?
*  We talked about this a lot for this one episode
*  and I talked to several others.
*  And yeah, again, I come away and I'm not sure what to think,
*  but again, I'm not closing the book on anything
*  at this point.
*  See, the way I'd looked at it is if these were unique
*  expeditions from another planet,
*  or whatever it is that comes here, some alien spacecraft.
*  All they'd have to do is come here once or twice.
*  Get fed up.
*  Well, not even that, but I used to have a bit about it,
*  how Earth is the Tijuana of outer space.
*  They only come down here when they're fucked up
*  and they wanna see a show.
*  That's why they don't stay.
*  They just come down here, what the fuck?
*  Like no one's doing any science expeditions to Tijuana.
*  I'm not going back there, no way.
*  Not unless I'm drunk again.
*  Yeah, well, I was just thinking that
*  if they were gonna come down here and examine us,
*  they could just do it a couple of times
*  and people have these stories and everybody has dismisses it.
*  Where are they?
*  I don't see any aliens.
*  Because you really wouldn't.
*  If they're capable of moving at the speed
*  that Fravor described, where it was just impossible
*  to track with the human eye.
*  They're not gonna view us as a threat.
*  No.
*  I don't think they think we're a threat.
*  I think they're just, I don't know.
*  Then I can look at us and say,
*  we wanna steal their technology.
*  It's the most fascinating thing to me.
*  At all the weird what ifs and who could do this
*  and how could that be true,
*  the alien one is the most fascinating.
*  Because if that was real,
*  and if we somehow or another one day
*  get some undeniable proof.
*  Like the Fravor film, the film footage,
*  the gunner footage, the radar footage,
*  that's pretty goddamn compelling.
*  But man, if there was something like off the charts.
*  Well, and that's the problem always is,
*  and people will point to that and say,
*  even the gun camera footage is,
*  look at this, it's not,
*  it's hard to follow a little bit.
*  It's not clear necessarily what it is I'm looking at.
*  But it is more compelling than a lot of the other
*  crap that's been out there.
*  So I think it was surprising.
*  But yeah, the hypersonics is the,
*  of all the episodes we did,
*  I think the hypersonics is the one
*  that really makes you stand up and think,
*  this is pretty fucked up.
*  If we get beat to this.
*  You don't wanna be in an arms race,
*  but you essentially are.
*  Who are we in the biggest race with?
*  Is it Russia?
*  China. China.
*  Yeah.
*  Because China has more resources.
*  Russia would say it's theirs, it's them.
*  They're claiming that they've got abilities.
*  But Putin is always getting out ahead of his skis.
*  And they've got the GDP of a small European country.
*  So particularly when oil is down where it is.
*  And so China's got the resources, the motivation.
*  They view themselves as,
*  they wanna be at the top of the heap.
*  They also have technological innovation
*  at a very, very, very high level.
*  Some of it's stolen.
*  Yeah.
*  Did I say that?
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of it's stolen.
*  Yeah, okay fine.
*  Some of it's stolen.
*  All right.
*  A lot of it.
*  But still, they're kind of clever.
*  Like, hey, we didn't figure it out,
*  but it's already been figured out.
*  Let's just steal it and then improve upon it.
*  Oh no, they can reverse engineer the shit out of anything.
*  Right.
*  And then they do learn from that.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, it's,
*  China would be the number one.
*  You've got Washington.
*  The interesting thing about threats,
*  if you look and say, okay, what are the top threats
*  in the face of the US?
*  The top three have never really changed in decades.
*  Russia, China, Iran.
*  And then what fills out the top two after,
*  if you go for the top five,
*  critical infrastructure here in the US,
*  which is actually probably at the top.
*  I mean, if you say to people in DC,
*  what worries you the most,
*  they'll say attacks on our critical infrastructure.
*  But Russia, China, Iran,
*  they may switch places occasionally,
*  but they're always up there in that top five.
*  Terrorism ranks somewhere down lower.
*  So China's always gonna be an issue.
*  And they've been very aggressive,
*  both in terms of acquiring information, economic espionage,
*  their military build out,
*  their desire to kind of take back the Pacific from us.
*  So yeah, it's our primary competitor.
*  But Russia punches above its weight.
*  And the narrative about Russia collusion
*  has captured the imagination for three years now.
*  And still seems to hold some interest for some Dems
*  in Washington DC, no matter what happens.
*  And then Iran kind of plays that role
*  because of its nuclear pursuits.
*  North Korea is up there to some degree,
*  but kind of bounces in and out of the top.
*  Anyway, for what that's worth.
*  But yeah, if you suddenly we find that Fravor's right,
*  or that there's this contact.
*  Suddenly guess what we, that's it.
*  That's the top concern at that point.
*  That's number one.
*  Right, right.
*  I mean, the hope is always that if we're about
*  to nuke ourselves into another dimension,
*  that the aliens will come down and go hit dummies.
*  Just like a 1950s movie.
*  Yeah, like hey, you fucking idiots, stop doing that.
*  The Day the Earth Stood Still.
*  Yeah, remember that one?
*  Yeah.
*  Plattu Barada Niktu.
*  Wow.
*  Remember that?
*  Look at you.
*  That's pretty impressive actually.
*  Day the Earth Stood Still is a great fucking movie.
*  It was a great movie.
*  It's weird, it's like a time capsule, right?
*  Because what they thought it would look like,
*  and the robot, it's just.
*  Yeah, no, I love the movie.
*  I tried to get my boys to sit and watch it not too long ago,
*  and they were like, really dad,
*  this is what you spend your time watching?
*  You know what was interesting?
*  I was like a normal thing that the family
*  took the alien in their house.
*  Come on in, stay with us strange person from another land.
*  Why wouldn't you?
*  Yeah, why wouldn't you?
*  He's talking to the kid.
*  Like you're not even a little suspicious.
*  You don't think this guy might be a creep?
*  What's your favorite movie?
*  What's your favorite sort of alien space genre movie?
*  Well, I like, the best one is Alien,
*  the Sigourney Weaver movie.
*  The first one.
*  That's most likely what Alien Life is gonna be like.
*  Some horrific parasitic fucking creature
*  that eats everything it finds.
*  That to me seems likely.
*  That seems more likely.
*  I remember sitting in the theater
*  when that movie came out, watching it,
*  and when it popped out of that guy's chest,
*  the entire theater jumped.
*  It was just crazy.
*  People, it's hard because you watch that movie today
*  and you're watching it having seen all the other movies
*  that it's affected and all the other science fiction
*  genre movies and special effects movies,
*  but that movie was special.
*  In 1979 when that movie came out, that was a special movie.
*  That was a fucking horrifically scary movie.
*  And it was realistic.
*  Like there was no cut the shit scenes.
*  Everything seemed legitimate.
*  The creature was completely unique.
*  Weaver was hot.
*  Hot as fuck.
*  Yeah, I mean, honestly.
*  Looking at pictures of Liz Hurley,
*  we should be looking at Sigourney Weaver.
*  And that's a great movie where a woman is the hero
*  and you're not flinching.
*  There's no part where you're going, what?
*  What is she doing?
*  She's kicking everybody's ass?
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  That's a movie where that's a real hero.
*  That's a real hero who rises to the occasion
*  in this horrific situation where this ship
*  has been overtaken by an alien.
*  I think that there's things out there.
*  I don't know if I believe,
*  I wanna believe that we've been visited,
*  but I don't know if I believe.
*  I think there's things out there.
*  Yeah, I'm on board with the second part of that as well.
*  I don't know.
*  I find it hard to believe it would be such a secret.
*  But, and also knowing the US government,
*  look, I mean, it's harder to find out
*  from the network when they're gonna start this show
*  than this getting secrets out of Washington, DC.
*  So I'm thinking, we would have known for now
*  if it had happened,
*  but I do believe there's other shit out there.
*  I just, I can't believe we're it.
*  No, I don't think we're it.
*  But maybe we're being hopeful.
*  I can't believe we're it.
*  I mean, but you know.
*  But I'm also fascinated to think that if they did know
*  that something was here,
*  that they would visit it occasionally,
*  drop in on it occasionally for a scientific expedition,
*  just see what the fuck we're up to.
*  Yeah, unless they just got so disgusted the last time,
*  they just thought, that's it, I'm done.
*  I don't think so.
*  We don't get disgusted when we go visit baboons.
*  When we study baboons, people, scientists return.
*  Robert Sapolsky, he spent many years going back and forth
*  to Africa studying baboons.
*  And baboons are boring as fuck compared to people.
*  If you weren't a person, if you weren't a person,
*  if you were from some enlightened race,
*  a million years advanced from us,
*  you would be so fascinated to come by and look at people.
*  Yeah, although they probably look at us
*  like we're a bunch of shit flinging monkeys.
*  So I think you're probably right.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, if we had a time machine,
*  tell me it wouldn't be amazing if there was a time machine,
*  but it could only go back 500,000 years ago
*  to the beginning of man.
*  Like the early, whatever ancient hominid that was,
*  that was alive back then.
*  God damn, that would be fascinating
*  to be a fly on the wall and watch these primitive humanoids
*  try to figure out fire and try to figure out hunting
*  and become what we are today.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  There would probably be moments, right?
*  I wouldn't want to sit and watch the whole thing
*  because I think that would be boring as shit.
*  I mean, come on, just get on with it.
*  Chip that rock into a circle, do something with it, come on.
*  But I think that, yeah, you're right.
*  I mean, if there's higher life forms out there,
*  you'd have to assume they are higher life forms
*  if they're traveling these distances.
*  And again, looking at the issues of propulsion systems
*  for hypersonic flight, et cetera,
*  would they look at this bunch of folks down here
*  and think, just not interested?
*  I don't know.
*  I think at a certain point in time,
*  it would be unnecessary to physically visit.
*  I feel like maybe-
*  They're watching us through the Samsung TVs.
*  Yeah.
*  See, it all comes, that's the thing about it,
*  it all comes back around full circle.
*  You gotta put a tape over that camera.
*  You do.
*  I think there's probably, you do, right?
*  How much-
*  You should, you should.
*  I mean, people should check their,
*  this is, yeah, again, smart TVs.
*  If you've got one that's of recent vintage, check
*  and you'll see there's a little hole along the frame,
*  that's the camera, and there's a microphone set up
*  on an audio system.
*  Yeah, just put a piece of tape over it.
*  That's your, whatever, your low cost solution.
*  You can go in there and adjust and turn it off,
*  but you try figuring that out, right?
*  That's like trying to program your VCR, right?
*  Trying to figure out how to get into your TV,
*  into the settings to change the smart interactivity,
*  and then do you also wanna trust
*  that that's what's gonna happen if you turn it off?
*  So, yeah, just put a piece of duct tape over it.
*  Well, they've showed that with Facebook,
*  that even if you turn off location,
*  they're still tracking you.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's why I say, again, going back to that same old thing,
*  which is like, oh, the government's trying
*  to screw us over, they're spying on us.
*  You know what, unless you're involved in criminal activity
*  or terrorism, they honestly don't have any interest,
*  but they also don't have the resources
*  and the time available.
*  Commercial side of things, though, is different
*  because it drives what they're all about,
*  which is making money.
*  Especially when you sign those terms of agreements,
*  the terms of use agreements.
*  Like, most people just accept it.
*  You don't look through it.
*  Right, well, there's a regulation.
*  There's a piece of legislation, whatever,
*  that outlaws secretly videoing.
*  I forget what it was.
*  It was years and years ago.
*  It was decades ago.
*  But you give up that right by clicking on agree
*  on those user agreements.
*  But I don't know anybody who's ever read a user agreement.
*  What is it, Jamie?
*  New law passed in California this year.
*  Consumer Privacy Act allows anyone who resides in a state
*  to access and obtain copies of the data
*  that companies store on them
*  and the right to delete that data
*  and opt out of companies selling or monetizing their data.
*  California leading the way again.
*  Only for residents in California, though.
*  If you live somewhere else, you can check,
*  but you can't have millions.
*  I'm moving from Idaho to California.
*  Yeah, just for this.
*  There's some good spots in California.
*  Yeah, no.
*  This isn't one of them.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a good spot.
*  Just too many people found out about it.
*  My worry is more of social media companies now than anything.
*  Even in a lot of ways more than the government's buying on us.
*  I worry about the power that something like Facebook has.
*  The insane amount of influence that they have on people
*  and how through the use of their algorithms,
*  they actually instigate arguments and try to get people,
*  because that's how people respond
*  and that's what makes people want to click on things
*  and that's what generates revenue.
*  So their algorithms encourage,
*  and the idea is that they encourage outrage,
*  but they don't really.
*  But people like outrage,
*  so they encourage you to go seek out,
*  Ari Shafir did an experiment where he used YouTube
*  and he only searched for puppies.
*  That's all he searched for, just puppies on YouTube.
*  And that's all YouTube would recognize.
*  That's all they were recommending to him was puppies.
*  And he's like, oh, okay.
*  So it's really not nefarious.
*  It's based entirely on what your needs are
*  or what your interests are,
*  but so many people are interested in things
*  that outrage them that it becomes a very profitable thing
*  for them when their algorithm shows these people
*  what they want.
*  But it's the problem is the people itself.
*  It's not necessarily the algorithm.
*  It's not like some, the algorithm is some nefarious algorithm
*  is designed to instigate the strife.
*  No, it's taking advantage of human nature to some degree,
*  but it's also, I mean, you've raised a really important point
*  because coming up on this election,
*  people are talking about, oh my God, they're gonna hack in,
*  they're gonna influence the vote,
*  part of the danger is in the social engineering
*  and the way, and it's very clever.
*  So let's say if you look at like a recent,
*  something that just happened,
*  this actually is really interesting
*  and it's still being investigated,
*  but a report came out from a group, Area One,
*  which is looking at hackers
*  and looking at cybersecurity issues.
*  And it's not a particularly well-known group.
*  It's not like Kaspersky or some of these others
*  that are out there, but they just came out with a report
*  a couple of days ago, basically saying that the Russians,
*  a Russian entity, likely the former GRU,
*  the Military Intelligence Group
*  of the Russian Intelligence Service, hacked into Burisma.
*  Now Burisma is that company in the Ukraine
*  that Hunter Biden was sat on the board of, right?
*  And now you think, oh, Russians hacked into it.
*  And so what happens almost immediately
*  when this report comes out saying a Russian intel operation
*  hacked into Burisma recently,
*  as it was sort of becoming an issue
*  and Trump was banging on about it and Hunter Biden
*  and there was talk about holding up Ukrainian aid
*  if you don't investigate the Biden situation.
*  So you'd look at this and if you just looked at it
*  on a very simple level, you go, wow.
*  And I've already seen some of that narrative saying,
*  well, look, the Russians are working
*  on behalf of Trump again, see?
*  That's what they're doing.
*  They're working on behalf of Trump.
*  They're hacking into Burisma.
*  And that's what he was complaining about.
*  If you step back and you think about
*  what are the Russians trying to do, right?
*  With all of their hacking efforts,
*  all their social media engineering,
*  they're trying to create dissent.
*  So now what have you got?
*  Now you're ramping up this story again.
*  Now, to what degree Area One's report is correct?
*  I mean, there's some discussion
*  as to whether it's accurate or not.
*  But to that degree that you have to look
*  at everything now with a very skeptical eye.
*  And you have to say, okay, what is the purpose of it?
*  Why, is this a timed leak of information?
*  Did they intend to, in other words,
*  did the Russian intel service,
*  they don't do anything haphazardly, right?
*  Did they do this with the idea
*  that we're gonna leak this out now
*  because now it looks like we're still,
*  we're pushing this whole thing.
*  We're trying to help Trump.
*  We're gonna get that narrative going again, right?
*  Because now we're getting into an election cycle.
*  It's interesting stuff.
*  It's like after we, after Soleimani was smoked,
*  almost immediately after,
*  social media posts, sort of pro, very subtly,
*  but pro-Iranian regime, pro-Soleimani,
*  again, very subtle, but in that vein,
*  they spiked over the course of the next 48 hours.
*  Massive numbers compared to what had been in the past
*  of sympathetic enough to turn people's thoughts, right?
*  To get that narrative going of like,
*  well, oh my God, they assassinated a foreign leader.
*  That's all they're looking to do is create that.
*  And the Iranian cybersecurity force
*  is increasingly sophisticated.
*  10 years ago, they probably wouldn't have been able
*  to orchestrate sort of that sort of social media work.
*  I guess my point being is that
*  we look at things very simplistically, right?
*  We look at it because we tend to look at it
*  through this political spectrum saying,
*  I'm right, I'm left, whatever.
*  But you have to step back and think,
*  you know, what are they doing?
*  What's the purpose of this?
*  And maybe it's more complex or layered
*  than just simply accepting what it is that's being said,
*  which happens, you know, that's the danger of social media
*  is everyone takes at face value
*  shit that they see on Twitter or whatever.
*  And rather than stepping back and going,
*  I wonder if this story is even accurate.
*  But you know, somebody will post some bullshit,
*  half the time it's, you know, it's just,
*  it's whether it's for the left or right doesn't matter,
*  or whether it's from a foreign entity,
*  you know, the state-sponsored effort.
*  You take it and you run with it.
*  Next thing you know, it's got 10,000 likes
*  and people are talking about it like it's correct.
*  Yeah, that's a real problem with today's social media
*  is that these agencies like the Internet Research Agency
*  in Russia did before the 2016 election,
*  they really can stir up dissent with these thousands
*  and thousands of social media accounts that they have.
*  And they can get people thinking in a certain way,
*  they can get people to argue things in a certain way.
*  And you hear those talking points that these bots
*  and these, you know, these companies that are designed
*  just to stir people up,
*  you see those talking points repeated.
*  So it is effective.
*  Oh no, absolutely.
*  And look, the Russians have been doing this,
*  you know, years and years ago, decades ago,
*  they were buying off journalists to write favorable articles
*  or articles that they wanted to get the narrative
*  out there for, right?
*  So they would pay off journalists,
*  whether it was overseas or here, wherever it may be.
*  And that was old school, right?
*  But the point of it, right?
*  The reasoning behind it is still the same, right?
*  You're trying to affect the narrative,
*  you're trying to affect a certain opinion,
*  or you're trying to foment dissent,
*  you're trying to create some chaos.
*  And you're right, here now with a lot of the social media
*  that foreign entities are doing,
*  they're trying to take advantage
*  and trying to drive wedges in.
*  So you get these things that try to drive
*  and create more of a racial divide, as an example,
*  whatever it is that they can do.
*  And sometimes they're doing it
*  just simply to create the chaos.
*  Sometimes they're doing it for a more specific focused reason.
*  But we're not sophisticated.
*  I think we're more aware of it now
*  because it's been in the news
*  and we've been talking about it to some degree,
*  but as a population, we're not very sophisticated.
*  And so they're still gonna take advantage of it.
*  And it's not just the Russians,
*  it's any nation that's got the resource or the ability
*  and somewhat motivation
*  and sees it in their own best interest,
*  they're gonna be engaged in this.
*  So I have a cyber unit that's doing this sort of thing.
*  So, I don't know where it's gonna go,
*  but you worry about sort of the impact that it has.
*  It's not the idea that they're going in there
*  to voting machines and switching up data.
*  I mean, frankly, we should be going to a paper-based system.
*  If I was in charge, I would say, that's it,
*  no more paperless voting systems.
*  Get that shit out of here.
*  We're not gonna rely on the internet.
*  You know what they're doing in Iowa for the caucuses?
*  It's all gonna be internet-based voting,
*  reporting for the caucuses in Iowa.
*  Right, you think, yeah.
*  But again, you think that,
*  whether it's independent hackers or state-sponsored
*  from China or Russia, wherever,
*  of course they're targeting this.
*  And they're putting a great deal of resource into it.
*  And they've already probably mapped out
*  the infrastructure.
*  So, hey, get back to the old days.
*  If you're targeting a terrorist organization
*  and you start having success picking up comms
*  and communications and gathering signals intelligence
*  on them, first thing they do is throw their phones away
*  and go back to the old system of,
*  look, I'm gonna handwrite some message.
*  I'm gonna hand it to my cousin.
*  He's gonna hand it to his cousin.
*  And that's all.
*  That's our communication system from now on.
*  So we should dumb down and go back to the old days
*  and just do a paper system,
*  which takes longer and is a pain in the ass, but.
*  Can't hack it.
*  Yeah.
*  Anyway, that's just me.
*  Well, listen, Mike.
*  I went back to my Bernie Sanders voice there.
*  It's always great having you in here, man.
*  Tell people again when your show,
*  well, you don't have an air date.
*  I don't know, they're keeping it mum.
*  When you tell me, we'll tell everybody.
*  That sounds good.
*  Let everybody know.
*  They can get ahold of you on Twitter and Instagram at.
*  MB Company, man, is the Twitter thing.
*  And yeah, thank you.
*  I'm always amazed at how fast the time goes.
*  Time's flying, bro. I'm sure you're not, but I am.
*  I'm amazed.
*  I am still amazed.
*  Get out the Boise, right?
*  Okay.
*  Everybody's waiting.
*  I'll do it.
*  All right, take care.
*  Thank you.
*  Bye everybody.
*  Bye.
