# Trump promises to secure parental rights
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo)
*  I'm for parental rights all the way. I don't even understand the concept of not being. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=0.0s)]
*  The parents truly love the kids. Some of these people on the boards, I think they don't like [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=6.68s)]
*  the kids very much, what they're doing. So you have to give the rights back to the parents. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  They called us domestic terrorists, President Trump, for speaking out at school board meetings [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=16.96s)]
*  today. Well, we'll change that on the first day I come this year. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=21.32s)]
*  Well, that was former President Trump taking a stand at the third annual Moms for Liberty [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=28.2s)]
*  Joyful Warriors Summit. On stage with Trump last night was Tiffany Justice, the co-founder [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=32.2s)]
*  of Moms for Liberty, and she joins us now. It's really great to have you on. So the pandemic [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=37.48s)]
*  is over, but the fight for kids, as you know, is still on. What are the issues that you [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=44.28s)]
*  are focusing on with Moms for Liberty right now moving forward? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, having President Trump on stage last night was absolutely amazing. And when he [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=55.080000000000005s)]
*  said that he was going to help us to restore our parental rights on day one, the whole [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  room erupted. These are moms whose kids were kicked out of school, who've gone to school [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  board meetings and were called domestic terrorists. So to have the former president and perhaps [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=68.08s)]
*  the future president of the United States stand up for parents is just awesome. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=72.88s)]
*  So the other ticket, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, by the way, Tim Walz, a teacher himself, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=76.64s)]
*  were they invited also at some point to Moms for Liberty? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=81.76s)]
*  They absolutely were. We extended an invitation originally to President Biden and then Vice [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=86.4s)]
*  President Harris when she became the candidate, and we received no response. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=91.2s)]
*  And so why, and I know you're personally supporting, not the organization is a nonprofit, it's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  non-political. You personally are supporting Donald Trump. What is it about Donald Trump [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  in particular that you think is going to be best for parents who care about parental [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=107.04s)]
*  rights in schools? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=111.68s)]
*  We talked last night about President Trump being a father, a grandfather. He truly understands [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  the need to protect parental rights. He said that, you know, he's a common sense type of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=119.04s)]
*  guy and he can't believe that anyone doesn't stand for parental rights. The concern right [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=122.48s)]
*  now is that a Harrods-Waltz ticket is the most radical anti-parent ticket that we could [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=126.56s)]
*  possibly have from the Democrats. My message to moms is you need to go vote. You need to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=131.12s)]
*  get out and tell your friends to vote and we need to fight like a mother. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=136.32s)]
*  Oh, I love that. The other troubling thing that happened during the Biden-Harris [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=139.68s)]
*  administration was the weaponization of the FBI against Moms for Liberty. Did Donald Trump [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=144.56s)]
*  speak to you, did the former president speak to you about what he would do to make sure that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=150.0s)]
*  those agencies, law enforcement, wouldn't be weaponized against parents of all things? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=153.84s)]
*  I think President Trump himself has dealt with law fair and the weaponization of the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=159.2s)]
*  federal government against him and his family. And so he absolutely understands the concern [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=163.6s)]
*  that we have. These are everyday moms and dads who are just trying to make ends meet, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=168.16s)]
*  which is getting harder and harder every day. And so just to have the president understand [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  where we're coming from and to help us to regain, you know, trust in our government again, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=175.6s)]
*  is something that's just really important to moms. And you saw them just, you know, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=180.24s)]
*  up on their feet applauding, so happy to see him. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  The name of the summit was Joyful Warriors. What do you want to convey with that? I mean, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=187.2s)]
*  I guess I get it. It's in the name, but I'm sure there's a lot more to that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=192.0s)]
*  There is. You know, during the pandemic, I think parents were very upset. We were very angry about [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=197.92s)]
*  the fact that we knew our kids were being harmed and no one was listening to us. And our kids were [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=201.76s)]
*  watching us as we were getting angry and trying to advocate, well, we're going to fight like hell [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=205.68s)]
*  with a smile on our faces because our kids are watching us and it's a privilege to fight for [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=210.16s)]
*  this country. And so the message is smile, have fun. We love America. We love our children. We're [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  going to make America great again. Yeah. And fight like heck for our kids. That's what moms do. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=220.0s)]
*  Moms for Liberty, I think you guys are just amazing and really just doing a lot for America [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=226.24s)]
*  behind the scenes at our school board meetings and places that a lot of people don't go but need to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=233.04s)]
*  be at more and more these days. So Tiffany, thanks for joining us. Tiffany Justice, Moms for Liberty. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wT7GxzuEzo&t=239.52s)]
