*  Palm Beach today after former President Trump was targeted in a second assassination attempt [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=9.94s)]
*  while playing golf on his course in Mar-a-Lago, Florida yesterday. That according to a Secret [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=15.72s)]
*  Service official. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=20.82s)]
*  The suspect is now apparently in custody after fleeing the scene where he left behind an [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=22.3s)]
*  AK-47 style rifle, a GoPro camera and two what appear to be backpacks or bags. The local [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=27.82s)]
*  sheriff's office says the suspect was between 300 and 500 yards from the former president [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=35.24s)]
*  and we're learning more about his prior run-ins with police and some of the things he said [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=40.72s)]
*  online which were political. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=46.1s)]
*  Yep, we have live team coverage this morning. We have Brooke Singman has the suspect's wild [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=48.18s)]

*  International Golf Club to walk us through exactly what happened. Good morning Dana Marie. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  Good morning guys. This is still a very active investigation crime scene still remains around [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=65.74000000000001s)]
*  the perimeter of the golf course. Many of those roads still closed to the public. Now [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=70.66s)]
*  we're about 12 to 15 minutes from Mar-a-Lago where former President Donald Trump lives [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=75.74000000000001s)]
*  and we know golf is something that he loves to do on Sunday. We heard from him on social [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=80.46s)]
*  media praising Secret Service and local law enforcement for keeping him safe speaking [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=85.86s)]
*  out about this. Now another important aspect of this is the map so you can see how close [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=91.86s)]
*  these golf course holes are to the public street here in West Palm Beach. Palm Beach [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  County Sheriff said Ryan Ralph was only about 300 to 500 yards away from the former president [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=102.66s)]
*  hidden in shrubbery with a gun while he played. The bubble moves through the golf course so [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=109.36s)]
*  our agents will get there first clear it. He noticed that the rifle was pointing out [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=117.8s)]
*  our agents engaged. We are not sure right now if the individual was able to take a shot [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=123.72s)]
*  at our agents but for sure our agents were able to engage with the subject. FBI and local [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=129.36s)]
*  law enforcement are posted at a mobile command center outside hole 5 and 6. Right now they're [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=136.36s)]
*  processing evidence including the rifle found on the scene. Now in the bushes this is where [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=143.36s)]
*  they found AK-47 style rifle. In the bushes where this guy was is an AK-47 style rifle [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=150.36s)]
*  with a scope, two backpacks which were hung on the fence that had a ceramic tile in them, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=157.36s)]
*  and a GoPro which he was going to take pictures of. So those are being processed right now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=172.16000000000003s)]

*  disturbed and will condemn political violence adding we must all do our part to ensure this [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=201.16s)]
*  incident does not lead to any more violence. President Joe Biden commended the Secret Service [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=206.32s)]
*  and their law enforcement partners for keeping the former president safe. Now as we heard [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=211.6s)]

*  sheriff who was on the scene spoke about the suspect's demeanor when he was taken into custody. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=255.0s)]
*  Listen. I was at the scene and he had a very very kind of detached flat facial affect like [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=259.64s)]
*  it wasn't bothering him. Blue lights everywhere, helicopter overhead. He never said hey what's that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=268.6s)]
*  about? Why did I get stopped? The FBI is now taking the lead on the investigation into the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=274.12s)]
*  scene and the suspect who we are learning more about. So he is originally from North Carolina [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=279.88s)]
*  and he moved to Hawaii in 2017. He does have prior arrests for drug possession, driving without a [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=285.08000000000004s)]

*  barricaded himself in his roofing company's office during a three-hour standoff with police [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=298.2s)]
*  after a traffic stop. Ruth's son telling the Daily Mail quote he is not a violent person, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=303.88s)]
*  he's a hard worker, a great dad, he's a great dude, a nice guy. Meanwhile we are learning the suspect [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=308.84s)]
*  was interviewed by the New York Times back in 2023 when he volunteered to help Ukraine in the war [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  with Russia. That article saying quote Ryan Routh a former construction worker from Greensboro, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=320.84s)]
*  North Carolina is seeking recruits from among Afghan soldiers who fled the Taliban. As of this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=326.04s)]
*  morning the suspect remains in custody as we are learning new details. Guys yeah I think he's been [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  arrested at least eight times but he's a nice guy. All right anytime you're holed up in a house in [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=338.12s)]
*  your background and that's on your resume it's unbelievable and on top of that he says he's an [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  unemployed low-income housey builder from Hawaii. Who isn't? NBC's uncovered over a hundred criminal [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=348.6s)]
*  accounts cases filed against him in North Carolina so there's a lot going on. It's interesting we [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=356.35999999999996s)]
*  were just talking to the state attorney David Ehrenberg down in Palm Beach County the feds [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=362.44s)]
*  have taken over the case but in asking what sort of charges he might be facing you know attempted [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=369.08s)]
*  assassination he said it would be hard to do that because the guy did not actually point the gun at [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump because Donald Trump was not visible. Of course keep in mind the the attempt you know [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  the gunman the guy with the gun uh who did not shoot it he didn't shoot it but he aimed at the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=389.56s)]
*  agent and the agent then returned fire. The one thing I want to know and can we put up the graphic [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=395.32s)]
*  that shows the golf course where was the guy's where was the guy's car um that he hopped in the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=401.64s)]
*  black Nissan. According to what we have heard it was between the the guy with the gun was between [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=409.48s)]
*  hole four and five and that's that little street right there between four and five that runs uh [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  east and west is Summit so if I had to guess his car was probably parked there and it was probably [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=423.32s)]
*  a passerby who saw a guy running hopped in the car and this passerby this uh good samaritan took [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=429.0s)]
*  a picture of the car with the license plate gave it to the cops and that's how we found the guy. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=436.2s)]
*  So that's interesting when you look at that map if he were if he was standing between hole four and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=440.92s)]
*  five Donald Trump was on hole five he was on the green and so he would have been on the opposite end [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=444.6s)]
*  to the far right of the screen so if this guy's between four and five he fired off shots 300 to [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=451.4s)]
*  500 yards away the police say. Well he didn't fire he didn't fire. Oh there were four they heard four [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=457.24s)]
*  popping noises. Yeah they don't know. Secret service. Well we don't do we know for sure he [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=463.0s)]
*  didn't get him shot off. Uh it sounded like from the state attorney he did not fire his gun. So we [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=467.08s)]
*  think that was secret service when they saw the AR through the fence then they fired those four shots. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=472.52s)]
*  Yeah that's what we know at this time. I'll add another thing so they keep on talking about well [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=478.04s)]
*  you should have they should get more secret service and why haven't they adjusted and they have adjusted [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=482.28s)]
*  so Mike Waltz was briefed on Thursday because he's with the assassination one task force [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=487.08s)]
*  and they said we would President Biden put presidential level secret service uh force around [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=492.84s)]
*  Harris and Trump but yet when we listened to the press conference yesterday from the sheriff he [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=501.4s)]
*  said it's not like he is the president this is not the level that he would have if he's president. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=506.67999999999995s)]
*  So they haven't when President Biden makes the decision they haven't a problem with execution [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=512.52s)]
*  because if he made that decision then they're not listening to him which is more of a problem which [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=518.76s)]
*  goes right back to Mayorkas. Well remember RFK Jr. also complained about not having secret service [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=523.72s)]
*  protection and he was given more protection after that. We thought things had changed after the first [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=528.4399999999999s)]
*  assassination attempt. We need to know has it changed? Does he need more protection because [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=533.8s)]
*  he was president at one point and he's running for president and this could be catastrophic if [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=538.28s)]
*  someone tried if someone were successful. If I had to guess I bet and I don't know this and we're [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=543.08s)]
*  going to hear from the secret service guys today if I had to guess this is probably the level of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  security he had when he was president at that particular club because you know you you don't [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  really it's impossible to have a cop everywhere outside and I didn't realize until yesterday [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=561.96s)]
*  that there's not a solid wall like cinderblock but instead it's a chain-link fence just anybody [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=570.12s)]
*  that might be changing yeah no kidding our first guest today said the guy could go right through it [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=577.8s)]
*  our first guest today said if he was president there would have been security on the outside [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=582.6s)]
*  meanwhile speaker Mike Johnson joined us an hour ago he met with the president three hours after [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=587.08s)]
*  the incident listened to what he said the president's response was in his demeanor. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=592.12s)]
*  We arrived there about the time that president Trump did we spent about three hours with him [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=597.64s)]
*  he was in very good spirits as you might expect that's who he is he's so resilient no leader in [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=602.52s)]
*  the history of America that has been so attacked and has remained so strong and so resilient he's [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=608.52s)]
*  one of a kind he is not going to stop fighting for the American people I got a briefing from the acting [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=613.8s)]
*  director of the secret service Ron Rowe within 90 minutes of the event I was actually sitting with [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=618.5999999999999s)]
*  president Trump when he called we listened to that in detail and and what I understand happened is [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=624.68s)]
*  that those agents that were with him yesterday saw that that barrel of that gun between the bushes [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=630.76s)]
*  on a golf course I mean you know that's a difficult thing to spot thankfully they did but unlike in [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=637.64s)]
*  Butler they did not pause they immediately pulled their weapons and fired I think that's why this [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=643.0s)]
*  guy the the suspect the shooter threw the gun in the in the bushes and ran had they not been there [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=649.08s)]
*  had they not acted so quickly and so decisively we might be having a different conversation today [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=656.44s)]
*  the one thing about the president you notice he does best under pressure you saw with the first [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=661.72s)]
*  shooting second shooting when things go going crazy around him that's when he's calmest if you [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=666.2s)]
*  think about it the maybe the truth social or the tweets that he wanted back when things are quiet [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=670.2800000000001s)]
*  like in the middle of the night when things are quiet when he's under when there's stress in this [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=675.0s)]
*  chaos around him he has the opposite reaction it's like an athlete's reaction he immediately put on [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=678.36s)]
*  social media I'm safe and well nothing will slow me down I will never surrender I will always love [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=684.2s)]
*  you for supporting me and hats off as you were mentioning to the witness the person who took a [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=689.24s)]
*  picture of the car took a picture of the license plate notified police they notified the next county [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=693.8000000000001s)]
*  because they knew the guy was driving on i-95 into martin county and the martin county police [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=698.76s)]
*  officers you saw in those pictures pulled him over and they detained him well and and one other [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=703.5600000000001s)]
*  thing and that is the secret service unlike in butler they actually had apparently drone a drone [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=708.44s)]
*  or drones over the golf course yesterday usually when they do something like that it's tethered [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=713.8000000000001s)]
*  like when we were at the national convention in milwaukee there was a drone tethered over the arena [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=718.9200000000001s)]

*  you know what that means steve you probably see the video leading up to him getting the car [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oet_WcpHyXI&t=731.96s)]
