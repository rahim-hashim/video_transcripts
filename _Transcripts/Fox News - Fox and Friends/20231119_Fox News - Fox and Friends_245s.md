# ‘Unprecedented’: Reverend Franklin Graham explains why he stands with Israel
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI)
*  The IDF intensifies strikes against Hamas terrorists at Israel's border with Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=0.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Christians around the world vowing to stand by our greatest ally in the Middle [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  East, Rev. Franklin Graham, the first major evangelical leader to visit Israel since the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=12.72s)]
*  war began, bringing much-needed supplies and praying with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=19.0s)]
*  Samaritan's Purse President, Rev. Franklin Graham, joins us now with more. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=24.8s)]
*  Rev, thanks for being here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=29.64s)]
*  What was your meeting like with the Prime Minister? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=31.72s)]
*  You prayed with him. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=35.0s)]
*  Give us a sense of that meeting, whatever you can disclose. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=36.24s)]
*  Well, first of all, he's laser-focused on bringing this war to an end and freeing the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=39.4s)]
*  hostages. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=46.96s)]
*  This is not a war that he started or Israel started. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=48.56s)]
*  This is something that Hamas started and it's brought an incredible amount of suffering, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=53.4s)]
*  not only in Israel, but in Gaza and on the West Bank. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  And so he's focused and we had a chance to pray. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=62.04s)]
*  And I pray that God will just give him wisdom and strength and that God would protect him [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  during these very difficult days. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=70.08s)]
*  And as a leader in the evangelical community, share with our audience why you're such a [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=72.68s)]
*  strong supporter of the state of Israel. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=77.52s)]
*  Well, first of all, it goes back to the scripture. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=82.36s)]
*  God chose the Jewish people to be his people. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=88.92s)]
*  And why he chose them out of all the nations of the earth, I don't know, but he did. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=92.64s)]
*  And so I believe the Bible, Pete, I believe the Bible to be the word of God from cover [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=97.48s)]
*  to cover. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=102.6s)]
*  And so God has a very special place, not only for Israel in history, but in the future, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  we see Israel when you read the scriptures. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=111.36s)]
*  So I believe in standing with them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=115.0s)]
*  And of course, we support the people that are suffering, the Jews, as well as Palestinians. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  Samaritan's Purse is helping in Gaza. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=122.92s)]
*  We're helping on the West Bank through churches. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=126.2s)]
*  We have about 80 church partners in that area that we're dealing with. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=128.52s)]
*  But there's so much suffering, Pete. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=132.26s)]
*  I just, I've never seen anything quite like this in speaking to the survivors. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=134.94s)]
*  We've provided 21 ambulances to Israel. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=141.94s)]
*  They lost 14 in the first few hours. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=147.45999999999998s)]
*  And we're replacing those 14, but we're buying seven additional armored ambulances. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=151.82s)]
*  They had 11 first responders killed. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  I spoke with survivors. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=161.54s)]
*  I spoke with a mother and her three daughters, and her fourth daughter is being held, or [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=163.62s)]
*  excuse me, she was killed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=171.14s)]
*  I spoke with another lady whose husband is being held as a hostage. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=172.7s)]
*  And it's just, the heartache is just incredible. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=178.34s)]
*  And so I prayed, and everyone I met with, I would tell them, you know, I'm a Christian, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=183.26s)]
*  but is it okay if I pray for you? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=187.85999999999999s)]
*  And everyone of them said, please, pray for us. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=190.82s)]
*  And I would just pray, and I would try to comfort them. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=194.06s)]
*  And my prayer for them was that God would put his loving arms around them, and that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=197.86s)]
*  they would sense and feel his presence, and that he is the father of all comfort, that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=203.54s)]
*  he would comfort these people that have lost so much. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=209.1s)]
*  It's staggering to hear you say that you see something unprecedented because of all the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=213.18s)]
*  places Samaritan's Purse goes, and all the good that you do. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=217.26000000000002s)]
*  It is phenomenal. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=222.62s)]
*  God bless you, Franklin, and your organization for what you're doing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=224.18s)]
*  Thank you for bringing that report from the ground and for reminding us of the power of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=226.9s)]
*  prayer. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=231.34s)]
*  We appreciate it, sir. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=232.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-MbWNdKJKI&t=233.34s)]
