# Vance delivered important message to Europe: Sen. Eric Schmitt
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4)
*  Vice President JD Vance defending free speech in a powerful address to the Munich security conference yesterday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=0.0s)]
*  Also urging European leaders to reject censorship [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=5.8s)]
*  Just as the Biden administration seemed desperate to silence people for speaking their minds [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=10.52s)]
*  So the Trump administration will do precisely the opposite and I hope that we can work together on that and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=15.4s)]
*  Washington there is a new sheriff in town and under Donald Trump's leadership [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=23.12s)]
*  We may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer it in the public square agree or disagree [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=27.12s)]
*  Here to weigh in is Missouri Senator Eric Schmidt great to see you Senator Schmidt [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=35.36s)]
*  You know, I was really struck by that entire speech from JD Vance [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=39.08s)]
*  And especially when he said to them he asked it's not what you're fighting against [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  It's what you're fighting for and I thought it was kind of a it was pretty amazing to hear him [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=49.68s)]
*  Lay out for them the importance of the most basic things like free speech and freedom of religion. I [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=54.56s)]
*  Totally agree. I was there in the audience [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=65.2s)]
*  And watched the speech live and I thought it was a great speech and a message that needed to be delivered [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  If we really believe in this thing called democracy or constitutional Republic [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=74.04s)]
*  We have to defend the right of people who dis, you know [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  Say what they want to say and it's that level of dissent. I think that makes us stronger in an honest in having an honest conversation [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=81.6s)]
*  It's really kind of a pressure release valve for me. It was particularly poignant because the job I had before being a senator [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=88.12s)]
*  I was Attorney General in Missouri [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=93.76s)]
*  We brought the Missouri versus Biden lawsuit that exposed this vast censorship enterprise that Joe Biden had with with the big tech companies to silence conservatives [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=94.96s)]
*  So we see it in the homeland. I think he's right president Trump [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=103.56s)]
*  Wants to move away from that kind of movement that is, you know, the left has been captured by but it is live and well [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=106.72s)]
*  Here in Europe, and I think it was a very very important message to deliver. So you were in the room there [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=112.16s)]
*  What was the reaction of everybody that you were sitting with? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=116.72s)]
*  Well, let's just say I was one of the few people standing and clapping [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  But I think that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=126.72s)]
*  But but let me say this I actually think and part of the reason why I'm here is [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=129.2s)]
*  I think we have to be honest and we have to stop telling our European allies what they want to hear and tell them the truth [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=134.0s)]
*  And so for me the message I'm delivering is we have to pivot to China in the United States [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=140.12s)]
*  They are a chief adversary the 21st century is going to be defined by who wins this great power struggle [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=145.24s)]
*  Our European allies have to step up for their own defense. They have not funded their their industrial base has been depleted [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=149.8s)]
*  They don't have armies to defend their own borders that has to change and so that's my message that I'm delivering [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm glad JD Vance our vice president my friend [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=162.88s)]
*  Delivered that message about free speech here on the European continent where people are literally being arrested for praying outside of abortion clinics [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=165.64s)]
*  And people are being censored online [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=173.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's truly extraordinary and he had that really funny moment earlier in the speech when he did get a round of applause [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=175.32s)]
*  And he said that this may be the last applause I get in this room [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=181.6s)]
*  And then he just launched right into that you mentioned a minute ago and you're right [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=185.04s)]
*  Obviously you are one of the the early warriors for free speech here in the United States [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  Obviously a lot of your former [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=196.24s)]
*  Democrat colleagues attorney generals are [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=199.56s)]
*  Going up against the Trump administration [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  trying to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  prevent Elon Musk Donald Trump Doge from [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=207.68s)]
*  Basically making the executive branch more efficient [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  How is that going to play out? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  They're gonna ultimately lose I mean the Democrats right now are just sort of on their heels [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  They they don't have their bearings. They don't have a leader [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  They've been very focused on unpopular issues and really they're swinging at every pitch in the throne as much as they can up against [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  The wall to see what sticks none of these cases are gonna hold up because here's the difference between [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  Cases that really deal with separation of powers and what President Trump's doing he's dealing with the executive branch of course the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=240.44000000000003s)]
*  Chief executive has the ability to make decisions on personnel and on wasteful programs that have been you know [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  We're not line-item in budgets two million dollars for Guatemalan sex changes [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=255.0s)]
*  That is what an administrative agency has decided to waste taxpayer dollars on and so President Trump has every right to reign that in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  And so I think as these make their way through the courts [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=267.36s)]
*  They might find a friendly judge here there [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=269.44s)]
*  But ultimately as it makes its way through appeals and having hearings on the merits President Trump's gonna be successful [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=271.12s)]
*  So real quickly, I mean do you think that it will wind up going all the way to the Supreme Court or it will? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=276.9s)]
*  get resolved before then I [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=282.14s)]
*  Think you know a couple of them might [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=285.7s)]
*  But ultimately once they make their way to the appellate courts or even actually a full-blown trial a lot of these are temporary restraining [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=288.17999999999995s)]
*  Writers that you don't even have all the evidence being introduced yet. So [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=294.73999999999995s)]
*  Senator thank you so much for joining us [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=298.82s)]
*  You [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwV1KKSzNw4&t=306.9s)]
