# Supreme Court to issue MAJOR ruling on trans athlete debate
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk)
*  The Supreme Court agreeing to hear a case on transgender athletes and decide whether [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=0.0s)]
*  states can ban biological males from joining female sports teams. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=7.08s)]
*  One of those cases is in West Virginia where biological male Becky Pepper Jackson is fighting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=12.36s)]
*  to participate in girls track and field. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=17.86s)]
*  Here to discuss is the governor of West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  So governor, tell me why it's so important for the Supreme Court to be taking up this [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  case and exactly what the states are arguing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. Well, thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=32.76s)]
*  This is a very important case and it's been lingering for a number of years. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=35.28s)]
*  Back in 2021, West Virginia passed a common sense law to ensure that men were not playing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=41.44s)]
*  sports with women and there was no discrimination. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  But this law was passed and there was a lot of concern about the basic unfairness [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=52.96s)]
*  of men playing sports with women. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=59.36s)]
*  And after this law passed, there was a lawsuit. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=61.72s)]
*  In fact, there was a biological male who wanted to participate within sports. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=65.04s)]
*  And unfortunately, as this process has gone on, that individual has ended up displacing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=73.08s)]
*  significant amounts of women in women's sports. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=79.76s)]
*  And you see this starting to happen in different parts of the country. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=82.92s)]
*  But here in West Virginia, we had a very clear, common sense law which ensured that men [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=86.84s)]
*  would play sports with men, women would play sports with women. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  There could be other opportunities as well for different classes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=96.28s)]
*  But we were very concerned about the fairness. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=100.72000000000001s)]
*  We're concerned about the displacement. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  We're very happy that the Supreme Court is going to hear this case. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, West Virginia is not the only state that's been concerned about this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  More than half of the states, 28 of them in the country, have bans on boys playing in [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=112.48s)]
*  girls sports and vice versa. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=118.36s)]
*  So does that add to your argument when it comes to the case that you're trying to make [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=120.12s)]
*  in front of the Supreme Court? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=124.84s)]
*  Well, we think it does. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=127.08s)]
*  And we think that the case law precedent that's starting to build up really will be a big [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=128.12s)]
*  plus because we think there are arguments just that were made recently that can be [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=132.72s)]
*  applied here to show that it's very reasonable for a legislature to make a decision on the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=138.44s)]
*  determination of sex. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=144.56s)]
*  That's what happened in this case, that there was a determination that sex at birth, that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=146.52s)]
*  people would be segregated based upon that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=151.88s)]
*  That's very, very significant, very reasonable. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=154.96s)]
*  So what the court needs to do is to analyze what the standards are going to be to determine [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=158.0s)]
*  that and find that it's not violative of the equal protection clause and Title IX. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=164.2s)]
*  We think that there are a lot of states across the country that want the same sort of clarity. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=169.16s)]
*  That's why we're very happy that this case is going up to the Supreme Court. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=173.76s)]
*  It's long overdue. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  And I want to commend all the people in West Virginia and across the country that have [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=179.04s)]
*  been working on this case to make sure we can get a good decision about this West Virginia [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=183.48s)]
*  law. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=188.6s)]
*  Do you have any expectations about how the Supreme Court will rule? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  I know that we saw the Education Department this week getting some concessions from the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=193.8s)]
*  University of Pennsylvania based on the upholding of Title IX. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=198.36s)]
*  Do you have any ideas or predictions about how the Supreme Court may listen to these [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=203.08s)]
*  arguments and what kind of decisions they may make based on the case you are making? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=207.24s)]
*  Sure. Why, I think that you never can predict exactly what the U.S. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=212.8s)]
*  Supreme Court will do. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=216.68s)]
*  And you have to go in very prepared. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=218.4s)]
*  But we think that the development of the case law starts to lead you in this direction, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=220.84s)]
*  that it's very reasonable for state legislatures to define the differences with men and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  women based upon biological sex. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=233.56s)]
*  And so I think that that's a very compelling argument. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  The other point that I would make is that this is a case that at a very exhaustive district [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=238.83999999999997s)]
*  court record where the district court judge originally slapped an injunction on the law. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  But after thousands and thousands of pages of evidence was provided, ultimately turned [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  around and sided with us. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=255.0s)]
*  And that's why we're very hopeful that as this ultimately went before the Supreme Court, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=256.96s)]
*  people would see the evidence and they would side in our direction. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=261.4s)]
*  So I can't ever predict what the total will be. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  But I'm very optimistic that we're correct on the law. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=268.44s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of legal precedent pointing to biological men not being in women's [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=271.24s)]
*  sports. And I think a lot of Americans across the country who want fairness restored and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=276.08s)]
*  the law upheld will be watching these arguments very closely. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=280.35999999999996s)]
*  Governor, actually, this is a basic case. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  This is a basic case of common sense. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=287.08s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm very hopeful it's going to get resolved the right way. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=289.12s)]
*  Indeed. Thank you so much for joining us this morning, Governor. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  Great to see you. Happy Independence Day. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=294.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=295.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbZX7WRDUk&t=306.08s)]
