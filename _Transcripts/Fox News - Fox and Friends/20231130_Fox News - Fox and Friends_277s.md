# 14-year-old survivor describes Hamas' massacre of her kibbutz: 'Bodies scattered everywhere''
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE)
*  As the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas extends one more day, 12 more Israeli families [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=0.0s)]
*  are breathing a sigh of relief after their loved ones were released yesterday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=5.3s)]
*  Among them, the family of Amit Shani, who turned 16 while being held hostage by Hamas. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Amit's cousin Ella survived the attack at the, I believe it's Be'ri Kibbutz, but suffered [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=16.0s)]
*  the unimaginable loss of her father during the horrific events of October 7th. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=22.78s)]
*  Ella joins us now to react to what she calls the bittersweet moment for her family. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=27.6s)]
*  Ella, thank you so much for coming on with us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=33.24s)]
*  You're only 14 years old. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=35.56s)]
*  You saw things that no one should see in their lifetime, but we were thrilled to find out [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=37.36s)]
*  that your cousin Amit, we've interviewed family members in your family about Amit. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=41.92s)]
*  We were all praying for him and he was released yesterday. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=46.64s)]
*  How's he doing? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=49.96s)]
*  I don't know much about how Amit is doing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=54.08s)]
*  I did talk to him, but it was, it was I who was mostly talking because I just had to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=56.48s)]
*  tell him how proud of him I am and how much I love him. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=63.04s)]
*  But I think he was pretty much exhausted and I couldn't hear much from him, but we're all [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=66.64s)]
*  just in euphoria just about the fact that he's back. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=72.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=76.4s)]
*  Ella, what did you see on that day on October 7th? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=77.4s)]
*  After we got out of the safe room. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=84.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=86.96s)]
*  I mean outside. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=87.96s)]
*  You were in the safe room with your mom, your brother and your brother's friend, right? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=88.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=91.96s)]
*  And your father had already been killed at that point, right? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=92.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=96.6s)]
*  So you came out of the safe room and what did you see? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=97.6s)]
*  I mean everything was in ruins. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=102.36s)]
*  Like I remember everything was on fire around us and there were exploded cars everywhere [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=105.68s)]
*  and there were trails of blood on the roads everywhere we walked on the sidewalks and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=111.72s)]
*  by the side of the sidewalks there were also like bodies scattered everywhere. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=119.4s)]
*  It looked like a battlefield. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=124.48s)]
*  And what about your dad, Ella? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=126.56s)]
*  What happened? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  I could not identify the body, obviously, since I'm a minor and the body's condition [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=131.96s)]
*  was too graphic for me to see it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=137.2s)]
*  I was told that he was shot and burned, but I'm just holding onto the hope that he died [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=141.4s)]
*  from being shot. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=152.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=155.16s)]
*  I understand as you were, when you came out of the safe room you saw one of your brother's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=156.16s)]
*  friends and he had blood all over his face. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=160.28s)]
*  What happened to his family? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  His father died and his baby sister, or he watched them being shot, did they survive? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=165.06s)]
*  The dad and his baby sister who was 10 months old? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=170.7s)]
*  No, they were both killed in the safe room. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=173.7s)]
*  His mother was also shot and she was taken to the hospital. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=176.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=180.22s)]
*  And they were both taken to their uncles and my brother is a very good friend of them so [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=181.22s)]
*  they also they went to a museum together a few weeks ago and to a restaurant and they [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=186.78s)]
*  tried to cheer them up, you know. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=196.62s)]
*  I mean, Ella, when I was told that we were interviewing you, I saw your age and I thought [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=199.45999999999998s)]
*  what a brave young lady. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=203.73999999999998s)]
*  How do you move on? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=206.14s)]
*  How do you go on with your life and how are you doing? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=207.26s)]
*  There's not really life to go on. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=214.26s)]
*  I mean, I'm now in LA explaining and giving testimony about what happened. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=217.82s)]
*  We can't go back to our house right now. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=225.1s)]
*  My family is staying in a hotel in the Dead Sea, which is obviously not a solution. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=227.98000000000002s)]
*  I mean, we can't live in a hotel for the rest of our lives. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=233.18s)]
*  And, you know, I kind of I'm not learning right now. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=235.74s)]
*  I'm not in school. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  I'm not doing my sports. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=241.58s)]
*  I'm not doing anything. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=243.02s)]
*  Just that these are not my life. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=244.94s)]
*  Like everything changed completely. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=247.34s)]
*  Nothing is like it used to be. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=251.66000000000003s)]
*  Ella, I'm so sorry. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=253.66000000000003s)]
*  You said that you didn't get to mourn your dad. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=254.94s)]
*  You just buried him. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=257.26s)]
*  I didn't get to tell him I loved him or I was proud of him or call him dad. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=258.38s)]
*  But, you know, as a parent, Ella, he loves you unconditionally. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=262.94s)]
*  He knows that you love him and you'll see him again one day in paradise. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=266.21999999999997s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=271.9s)]
*  Amen. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=273.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=275.02s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-zMlL9DlE&t=275.9s)]
