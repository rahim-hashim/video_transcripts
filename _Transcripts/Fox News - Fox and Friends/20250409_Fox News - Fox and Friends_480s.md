# Trump admin faces deadline on Mahmoud Khalil deportation
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM)
*  10 minutes after the top of the hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=0.0s)]
*  So the Department of Homeland Security has until 6 p.m. Eastern Time to submit evidence [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=1.52s)]
*  that support Mahmoud Khalil's removal from the United States. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=5.88s)]
*  Todd Pyro joins us now with more. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=9.72s)]
*  Hey Todd. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=11.56s)]
*  Hey guys, good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=12.56s)]
*  Khalil appearing before a judge in Louisiana yesterday for an immigration proceeding where [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=13.56s)]
*  he denied eight allegations against him. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=16.62s)]
*  He's accused of leading activities aligned with Hamas and lying on his visa application. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Khalil's attorneys say they have not received a single document from the government after [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  they requested evidence in the case. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=28.46s)]
*  The legal permanent resident and Columbia University graduate accused of leading some [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=30.700000000000003s)]
*  violent anti-Israel protests on the university's campus last year. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=34.9s)]
*  Khalil was arrested by ICE in March and detained in New Jersey for a day before being flown [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=39.06s)]
*  to a detention facility in Louisiana where he is currently being held. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=44.42s)]
*  In a recent op-ed, Khalil claimed that Columbia laid the groundwork for his quote, abduction, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=48.6s)]
*  and says students must continue to resist what he describes as repression. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=54.46s)]
*  He wrote in part quote, the student movement will continue to carry the mantle of a free [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  Palestine. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=65.02s)]
*  The judge will make a decision on his removal following another hearing on Friday. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=66.26s)]
*  Khalil's lawyers are also challenging the legality of his detention in a separate federal [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=71.26s)]
*  case in New Jersey. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=75.32s)]
*  Back over to you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=77.04s)]
*  It could be if they're prepared Todd, this could be a fountain of information and unveiling [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=78.04s)]
*  because there's talk about direct links to organizations that go right back to Amos. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=83.08s)]
*  There's testimony that could be used from hostages that are now released and then with [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=87.36s)]
*  him you could ripple it right down through others at Columbia. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=91.28s)]
*  So there's a connection to Amos but he also lied on his form on his visa application. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=94.88s)]
*  So just on that alone, I think the administration is going to present that in court. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=99.28s)]
*  The visa application is voided out because he lied, right Todd? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=104.52s)]
*  Yes, but also I do want to follow up on Brian's point. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=107.56s)]
*  Now Lawrence, you may be correct in terms of how this case could ultimately be adjudicated. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=110.8s)]
*  You lie, you're out. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=114.88s)]
*  To Brian's point, if we can utilize this case, sort of like a detective ferrets out a lot [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=116.22s)]
*  of information to get other people involved in a situation, I don't want to use the word [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  crime because we don't know exactly what is at play here, but they can get that information [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=126.62s)]
*  through a long protracted process. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=131.88s)]
*  May not be great, may not be what the people want to see, but if you can get that information [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=133.88s)]
*  I think it will help the country in general. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=138.32s)]
*  Well because the judge has said that if there's not solid evidence, she's going to essentially [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=140.16s)]
*  terminate the case and that's going to be it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=148.4s)]
*  However, if the government presents solid stuff, look for this to be the model that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  they use to boot other people out of the country. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  And of course, as we've said, expect this to always end up at the Supreme Court. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=158.16s)]
*  All these things are going to end up at the Supreme Court and that case will ultimately [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=161.92s)]
*  determine what can happen for other individuals besides Khalil Goingfolk. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=165.32s)]
*  All right, Todd, thank you so much. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, Khalil has denied all the eight allegations against him and the two charges of removal, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=170.08s)]
*  but the judge, she said, let him see the evidence, let him argue his case and then we'll come [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=173.72s)]
*  back to court on Friday and I'll decide whether or not he can be removed from our country [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=178.4s)]
*  or if he's released into the United States. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=182.88000000000002s)]
*  This is going to have to go to the Supreme Court because I hope they understand what [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=185.24s)]
*  they're doing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  If the courts, if the lower courts now decide that this is the legal remedy, every time [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  someone gets denied a visa application, they're going to be able to challenge it in court. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=193.64s)]
*  So they're going to open the door for more legal challenges if this is the case. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=199.32s)]
*  The executive has the authority to say, look, you're not approved. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=204.4s)]
*  And that's under the State Department. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=208.12s)]
*  But you know, his attorneys are arguing this is a person-amended issue and he, the reason [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=210.16s)]
*  he was targeted was because he was speaking his mind. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  Ultimately this judge, later today, is going to figure out whether or not there's enough [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=218.0s)]
*  evidence that outweighs those person-amended constraints. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=221.72s)]
*  There are laws on the book. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=225.6s)]
*  You can't lie. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=226.67999999999998s)]
*  You can't, I mean, look at Hunter Biden. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  And they're not even disputing that, Angela. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  You can't lie when you're trying to get a visa. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=231.32s)]
*  And if you're connected to a terrorist organization, if you can prove that he was, you can't be [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=234.16s)]
*  in our country. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  And it's not just about Kalil and Cornell. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  Excuse me, it's not Columbia. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  It's Cornell too. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=243.28s)]
*  Donald Trump's administration has frozen through the Commerce Department one billion [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  in funding for Cornell. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=248.2s)]
*  790 million for Northwestern. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=251.0s)]
*  For Brown, 510 million. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=253.96s)]
*  Harvard, 9 billion. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=256.12s)]
*  Pennsylvania, 175. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=257.56s)]
*  Princeton got word of 4 million. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=259.16s)]
*  And Johns Hopkins, 800 million. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=261.72s)]
*  In some of these cases, it's not just anti-Semitic. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=264.36s)]
*  It's hey, you're pushing forward on this climate change things over in Princeton. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=267.68s)]
*  I don't want to fund that anymore. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=272.24s)]
*  And that's what Harold Lutnick told the people over in New Jersey. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=273.76s)]
*  The White House says the money was frozen in connection with several ongoing credible [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=277.48s)]
*  and concerning Title VI investigations. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=280.64s)]
*  Title VI, it prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=289.44s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=292.92s)]
*  It's after, there were, on these universities, and we knew that this was coming because the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=293.92s)]
*  administration sent out notes to 60 different universities and said, look, we're very concerned [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=299.16s)]
*  about your reaction to the anti-Semitism, what you did, and also the discrimination [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=303.68s)]
*  with all the DEI stuff. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=307.64s)]
*  What's interesting about this announcement with Northwestern is the fact that it is the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=309.44s)]
*  first non-IV league school where they have frozen the money. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=314.32s)]
*  And it's interesting, the House Education Committee chided Northwestern over the fact [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  that they had set up legal clinics in the law schools that represented organizers of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  anti-Israeli protests. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=328.96s)]
*  So it's like, okay, whose side exactly are you on? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=331.15999999999997s)]
*  So the university is going to have to show that they are on the side of everybody. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=334.11999999999995s)]
*  It's going to be a massive examination of these foreign students. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  It has to happen. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=342.32s)]
*  We have been funding indoctrination camps all over the country at these universities [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=343.52s)]
*  to people to hate our country, to object to our country. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  Everything that we believe in, it's fine. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=352.32s)]
*  If you want to go to another country and promote these ideas, but I don't like all these kids [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=353.79999999999995s)]
*  suddenly wearing kofiis all over America that don't even understand what they represent. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=358.44s)]
*  How many campuses did that go to where the kids straight up denied October 7th happened? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=362.76s)]
*  They learned it from somewhere. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  The professors are out there creating barricades around the students. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  I want to see Democrats defend this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=372.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=374.24s)]
*  Good luck with it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=375.24s)]
*  Those are your people. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=376.24s)]
*  That's your base? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=377.24s)]
*  That's what you want to defend? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=378.24s)]
*  Anti-Americanism schools, you want to say it's okay for a kid from Algeria to get in [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=379.24s)]
*  instead of a kid from Kansas? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=382.64s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1qV4MIGlbM&t=384.76s)]
