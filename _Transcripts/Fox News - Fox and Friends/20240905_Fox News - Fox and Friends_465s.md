# FBI interviewed GA school shooter in 2023 about online threats
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg)
*  8.01 here in New York City, same time in Georgia where we've got a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=0.0s)]
*  Schools all across the country are on high alert after that deadly shooting at Apalachee [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=6.2s)]
*  High School in Georgia. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=10.28s)]
*  So police say two 14-year-old students and two teachers were killed by a 14-year-old [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  student who had the FBI. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=16.76s)]
*  The FBI had interviewed him just last year. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=18.76s)]
*  Dana-Marie McNichol is in outside the school in Winder, Georgia with more on the suspect [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=21.76s)]
*  and the victims. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=27.3s)]
*  Dana-Marie. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=28.3s)]
*  Well, good morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=30.3s)]
*  We do know that law enforcement say the shooter is communicating with them. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=32.74s)]
*  Fox News has decided not to name the shooter. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=37.1s)]
*  Of course, the timeline of the day is still under investigation, but police say that first [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=40.58s)]
*  call came in at 10.30 in the morning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=45.46s)]
*  Obviously, the shooter was armed and our school resource officer engaged him and the shooter [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=48.1s)]
*  quickly realized that if he did not give up, that it would end with an OIS, an officer [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=55.26s)]
*  involved shooting. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=64.3s)]
*  He gave up, got on the ground and the deputy took him into custody. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=65.3s)]
*  The weapon that was used in this was an AR platform style weapon. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=68.98s)]
*  Last night we learned the names of the four people who lost their lives. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=75.25999999999999s)]
*  Mason Schirmerhorn, a 14-year-old student. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=79.06s)]
*  Christian Angulo, a 14-year-old student. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=82.7s)]
*  Two teachers, Richard Aspenwall and Christina Irmi. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=86.66s)]
*  Now, according to the school's website, the adults killed were both math teachers and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=90.66s)]
*  Aspenwall was also an assistant football coach. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=95.38s)]
*  Students were escorted onto the school's football field yesterday as they waited to be reunited [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=99.18s)]
*  with loved ones after a traumatic day. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=103.5s)]
*  You can hear the fear in their voices when we spoke to them. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=105.98s)]
*  I just feel like you're basically never safe anywhere and no matter like how you can like, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=109.9s)]
*  no matter if there's like cops in the school, there's still no safety at all. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=121.86s)]
*  Questions still remain about how the shooter got the gun inside the school, but we do know [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=131.78s)]
*  the teenager was on FBI's radar since last year. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=135.66s)]
*  In May 2023, the FBI's National Threat Operations Center received several anonymous tips about [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=139.1s)]
*  online threats to commit a school shooting at an unidentified location and time. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=144.78s)]
*  The online threats contained photographs of the gun. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=149.78s)]
*  The subject denied making these threats online. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=152.9s)]
*  There was no probable cause for arrest or to take any additional law enforcement action. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=156.42s)]
*  Authorities went to the 13-year-old's then at the time home, spoke to his father and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  said he had a hunting gun in the house and that his son never had unsupervised access [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=167.62s)]
*  to the guns. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=172.74s)]
*  The FBI referred this information to the Jackson County Sheriff's Office for action. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=175.46s)]
*  The Jackson County Sheriff's Office identified and located Gray, who is our suspect in this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=180.62s)]
*  case. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=186.06s)]
*  They conducted an investigation at that time and there was no probable cause for arrest [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=187.22s)]
*  or to take any additional law enforcement action. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=191.82s)]
*  And authorities say that 14-year-old is in police custody. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=197.42s)]
*  He will be charged with murder and tried as an adult. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=200.3s)]
*  As for this community, of course there in Mourning, there were several vigils held last [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=204.18s)]
*  night. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=208.78s)]
*  School in this county will be closed for the rest of the week as this investigation continues. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=209.94s)]
*  Dana Ray, we thank you very much for the live report from Georgia. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=216.26000000000002s)]
*  So she just indicated that an AR weapon was used and at the same time talked a little [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=219.06s)]
*  bit about how when the cops went to the house, the father said, yeah, I've got hunting guns [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=226.78s)]
*  but the kid doesn't have unsupervised access to them. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=232.32s)]
*  That's the way the cops depicted it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=236.3s)]
*  There's nothing that actually connects this gun to the family at this point. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=239.86s)]
*  We don't know where the gun came from. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=243.94s)]
*  It could have been the family's gun. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=245.7s)]
*  Then again, it could have been from somewhere else. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  They also have not mentioned what sort of a motive, what motivated the guy to do this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  You know, when you look at only four people, just four people, it could have been a lot [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=256.3s)]
*  worse, but two math teachers and two students and as soon as the school resource officer [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=260.58s)]
*  approached him, he just said, I give up. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=266.38s)]
*  No doubt he saved a lot of lives, some cops in the house. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=269.41999999999996s)]
*  Takes a lot of guts to walk up to somebody with a gun. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=273.09999999999997s)]
*  Even if you have a gun. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=275.42s)]
*  Because some have hid and not gone in before. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=276.42s)]
*  So kudos to this law enforcement officer that did this. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=279.94s)]
*  I guess my big question when it comes to the FBI and local police is what is an interview? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=283.06s)]
*  What is watching? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=290.04s)]
*  What is on your radar? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=291.04s)]
*  Because so many, I mean, we've covered so many of this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=292.5s)]
*  Remember the Buffalo shooting? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=294.3s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=295.3s)]
*  Or Yuvaldi or calls were made. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=296.58s)]
*  So when you say someone is being watched or on your radar, what does that consist of? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=299.3s)]
*  Because we continue to report on these shootings in schools or terrorist incidents where they [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=305.82s)]
*  said that this was happening. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=311.42s)]
*  And obviously they're not being watched if they're committing the final act. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=313.3s)]
*  This was a gut punch to every parent in America, many of whom took their child to school for [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=317.14s)]
*  the first time this week after Labor Day. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=321.7s)]
*  Mason Shennimore went to school. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=324.54s)]
*  He was autistic and his family literally put out a message saying, if you find him, calm [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=326.28s)]
*  him down. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  He wasn't answering his phone and then he lost his life. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=332.65999999999997s)]
*  He loved going to Walt Disney World. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=335.21999999999997s)]
*  Mason had just transferred to the school. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=337.18s)]
*  Mason should still be with us. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=338.84s)]
*  As should that other student, those two teachers, one of those teachers, the math teacher, by [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=340.02s)]
*  the way, you see there, a hero football coach who died when he was opening the door to let [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=344.14s)]
*  students out. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=349.06s)]
*  He died a hero. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=350.26s)]
*  And you wonder if it is the parents' gun, if this figures, if the parents' gun and they [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=351.26s)]
*  didn't secure it, if they're going to be legally liable after that case. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=357.26s)]
*  We've seen it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=362.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=363.5s)]
*  That's where it's going to be key. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=365.42s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, if you know that if you're a parent, you leave that gun out. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=366.42s)]
*  I trust my son. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=368.3s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=369.3s)]
*  If you trust your son for your own freedom, you trust him. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=370.3s)]
*  If you're going to allow him to go out with us, just know you're going to go to jail too [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=372.34s)]
*  if you know your son, if your son's out of control. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=376.26s)]
*  The other thing is, if law enforcement wants more power, if those FBI agents left that [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=379.22s)]
*  room and said, I wish I had the ability to detain this kid, but I don't, I want to hear [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=383.8s)]
*  it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=388.82s)]
*  I want to hear it now. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=389.82s)]
*  Tell me, the Buffalo Kid who shot up everyone in that mall, they detained him, they kept [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=391.14s)]
*  an eye on him. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=395.7s)]
*  He goes up 500 miles upstate and starts shooting people, and he was a racist. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=396.7s)]
*  And now you have this guy, if they had additional power, what would they have done? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=401.02s)]
*  My sense is they knew the kid was lying when he said it wasn't his, because forensically, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=405.78s)]
*  we're finding people in caves in Afghanistan, forensically. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=410.3s)]
*  I'm pretty sure we know where the 13-year-old gamer that was his threat. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=415.02s)]
*  Tell us what you need. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=419.5s)]
*  So we can stop this from happening. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=420.94s)]
*  Also, sweet off to those young people that drug that coach inside of the classroom and [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=422.62s)]
*  began to hit CPR and covered the gunshot wound. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=429.7s)]
*  I mean, your parents, obviously this was a terrible decision. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=433.3s)]
*  She'd be proud of you for taking it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=436.18s)]
*  I mean, not a lot of people is dragging bodies in when gunshots are ranking out. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=438.34s)]
*  And every senator in America should be embracing the Marsha Blackburn bill. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=443.06s)]
*  Maybe Trump can lead the charge on this to get more school resource officers, retired [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=446.66s)]
*  law enforcement veterans in our schools. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=450.26s)]
*  That made a difference yesterday. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=452.46s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evODUkU_Fg&t=453.65999999999997s)]
