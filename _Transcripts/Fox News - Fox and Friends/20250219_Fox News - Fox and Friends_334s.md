# Trump, Musk ‘acutely aware’ of media trying to drive them apart
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4)
*  All right last night here on Fox you saw President Trump and Elon Musk opening up about their relationship [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=0.0s)]
*  And their shared goal to cut wasteful spending during an interview with Sean Hannity [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Elon called me. He said you know they're trying to drive us apart. I said absolutely I wanted somebody really smart [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=12.46s)]
*  To work with me in terms of the country a very important aspect the president is the elected representative of the people [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=19.2s)]
*  So it's representing the will of the people and if the bureaucracy is fighting the will of the people and preventing [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=26.96s)]
*  The president for implementing what the people want then what we live in is a bureaucracy and not a democracy [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=33.76s)]
*  This all comes as Democrats and some of the media are fixating over who exactly is running doge [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Rather than the jaw-dropping findings about government waste which is widespread here to react is Fox News contributor guy Benson guy [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=47.84s)]
*  Good morning to you [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=55.6s)]
*  Hey, you know I think it drives a lot of people crazy to think that the world's most powerful man and the world's richest man [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  Are actually working together in the public is something like we've never seen before and it seems to be working out for both of them [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=66.84s)]
*  Yeah, one of the things that was striking to me last night was [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=75.64s)]
*  This response by the two of them sitting there together just the visuals of it [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=79.68s)]
*  We've seen this argument from the critics. Well who elected Elon Musk and I think that's a weak point for a number of different reasons [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=84.6s)]
*  But here they are sitting side-by-side and the signal very clearly is here's the president of the United States duly elected [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  Just a few months ago by the American people [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  He is putting his imprimatur on what Elon Musk and his team are doing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  Especially in the executive branch and the agencies the boss of which all the way at the top is the elected president of the United States [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=107.08s)]
*  So that was one thing that stuck out to me [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=113.64s)]
*  And then you heard the clip there as well with Trump and Elon both acknowledging [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=115.92s)]
*  It's very obvious that the media the Democrats others are trying to drive a wedge between them [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=120.54s)]
*  We've seen this in a lot of the commentary like ooh at some point [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=126.28s)]
*  They're gonna blow up because they're two giant egos [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=130.38s)]
*  They're very clearly acutely aware of that dynamic and talking about it publicly [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=133.8s)]
*  Which I think is an interesting admission and probably a healthy thing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=138.96s)]
*  Well, in fact, we've got a little snippet to show you from another channel here is a White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=142.2s)]
*  Who's asked? Hey, who exactly is running that thing watch? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=150.24s)]
*  So who is in charge of Doge? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=154.32s)]
*  The president of the United States he's the administrator of Doge [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=158.2s)]
*  No, the Doge is the what was formerly US Digital Services [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=163.84s)]
*  It's an agency the federal government that reports into the office of the executive office of the president [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=169.16s)]
*  Which reports to the president of the United States? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=175.48s)]
*  And he's accurate. I mean [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=178.6s)]
*  They've changed that department now. It's Doge, but it is the president at the top of the flowchart [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=181.84s)]
*  Yeah, I know it's hard to grok for some people and you might have some issues with some of the things Doge is doing and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  That's fine [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=196.72000000000003s)]
*  But this puzzlement over is any of this legal who's really in charge? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  The president selected he puts a team in place [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  He delegates responsibility and there's a chain of command Donald Trump is not sitting at his desk all day [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=206.22000000000003s)]
*  Right looking at line items, right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=212.12s)]
*  He has given that responsibility to several other people who are overseen by Elon Musk [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=214.36s)]
*  This is not a mystery in many ways. It's not unusual in our government [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=219.72000000000003s)]
*  But I guess it has to be spelled out for some of the people who are at least playing dumb [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=224.28s)]
*  Well and to your point guy, you've got the president [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=228.72s)]
*  He's the big picture guy and then right next to him is the guy [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=232.02s)]
*  Explaining what they're doing and he knows in a to a granular level exactly what Doge is doing and ultimately [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=236.68s)]
*  To your point as well about you know, some people might not be happy about what's happening [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=244.04s)]
*  But nonetheless they are being quite transparent in explaining what they're doing and why they're doing it [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=248.74s)]
*  All right, so many bureaucrats speaking of unelected people forever right for decades and decades [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=255.28s)]
*  They move our money around in the shadows, right? And sometimes it gets a little bit exposed often [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=260.96s)]
*  No one knows a thing here [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=267.6s)]
*  You have two people committed to reducing a lot of the waste and the fraud and the abuse and there's plenty of that to go [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=269.84s)]
*  Around that should be cut down right and they're giving nationally televised interviews about it together [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=275.88s)]
*  Right again, I'm not defending every last thing but overall the mission here the picture the way they're going about it [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=280.79999999999995s)]
*  The fact that they are being transparent with people and like putting full documents out on X or or Twitter [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  Which of course Elon owns that seems a lot better to this [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=292.96s)]
*  previous alternative in the status quo that a strange number of people seem [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=296.84s)]
*  Very very committed to and invested in whereas most American taxpayers. I think are in a very different position, right? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=301.32s)]
*  The average American likes the fact that that Doge duo is putting the so-called permanent government on a skinny diet [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=308.64s)]
*  So, let's see what happens guy. Thank you very much for joining us today from Washington [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=317.32s)]
*  You bet you bet [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RcCc8XbV4&t=322.08s)]
