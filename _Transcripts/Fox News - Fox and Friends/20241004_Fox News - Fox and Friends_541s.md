# Bret Baier: This story keeps getting bigger
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk)
*  Red Bear, ladies and gentlemen, the only guy in the blazer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=0.0s)]
*  We need to do this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=3.0s)]
*  Alright. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=5.0s)]
*  Alright. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=7.0s)]
*  Alright, uh, Ainsley and Brian and Lawrence, we wish you were here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=9.0s)]
*  It's a great place. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=14.0s)]
*  The chef is amazing, just saying. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=15.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's really fun being here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=17.0s)]
*  What a great crowd. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=19.0s)]
*  And, uh, I tell you what, this place is legendary. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=21.0s)]
*  Legendary. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=24.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=25.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=26.0s)]
*  So, since we've got the guy from Special Report, uh, let's talk about the news of the day, guys. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=27.0s)]
*  Hey, uh, hey guys, can we, can we start with Hurricane Helene? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=31.0s)]
*  We thought it was gonna slam into Florida. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=35.0s)]
*  Obviously, Florida does hurricanes better than anyone else, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=37.0s)]
*  because they've got so much experience. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=40.0s)]
*  DeSantis has been extraordinary. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=41.0s)]
*  But North Carolina has really paid the price. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=43.0s)]
*  Six states have paid the price, arguably North Carolina the most, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=45.0s)]
*  especially in the western part of the state. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=49.0s)]
*  What I'm amazed at, Brett, to put in perspective, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=52.0s)]
*  is that so far we hear people complaining about aid, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=55.0s)]
*  but we don't see the press pressing the Biden administration [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=58.0s)]
*  on what they were doing prior, what they're doing now, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=61.0s)]
*  and why it's taken so long to get the Army involved, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=64.0s)]
*  who is right there in Fort Bragg. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=69.0s)]
*  Brett, what is your take on how the press seems to be giving Biden and Kamala Harris a pass? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=71.0s)]
*  This is a big, big story, and it gets bigger every day, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=78.0s)]
*  as these folks are dealing with a lot of tough things. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=81.0s)]
*  You know, I know the locals and the state governments are trying to mobilize, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=84.0s)]
*  but what the federal government does, if you remember back to Katrina, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=88.0s)]
*  obviously it all went up to the Bush administration, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=91.0s)]
*  maybe not fairly at the time, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=94.0s)]
*  but that is the perception that the government can come in when it wants to. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=97.0s)]
*  There are a lot of people feeling it, and it's actually, the anger is building. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=101.0s)]
*  I think the story only gets bigger coming days, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=105.0s)]
*  as we head closer and closer to an election, too. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=108.0s)]
*  You know, Brett, I think it was two months ago where you had Alejandro Mayorkas [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=111.0s)]
*  that said that they had everything that they needed in FEMA. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=115.0s)]
*  They were ready for these storms, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=118.0s)]
*  and then they come back to the American people months later [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=120.0s)]
*  and say that they're going to run out of money. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=123.0s)]
*  It just seems like malpractice. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=126.0s)]
*  He should have foresolved this, right? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=128.0s)]
*  Yeah, listen, that's a big deal, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=132.0s)]
*  and if they have to call back Congress to approve another tranche of money [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=134.0s)]
*  because it's running out, that's a really big story as well. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=138.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of folks who are to blame here, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=141.0s)]
*  but we know hurricane season is going to hit every year, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=144.0s)]
*  and it's a busy hurricane season this time. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=147.0s)]
*  There's another one churning. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=150.0s)]
*  They've got a big hill to climb as far as getting this money out. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=152.0s)]
*  Yeah, we just hear all these terrible stories. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=155.0s)]
*  We interviewed someone earlier today, a couple, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=157.0s)]
*  and, Brett, their whole house, they lost their house. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=160.0s)]
*  Three or four people on their street lost their house. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=163.0s)]
*  They showed us a video. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=165.0s)]
*  It looked like Lake Murray in South Carolina where I grew up, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=166.0s)]
*  and it was everything's underwater, and they said they tried to contact FEMA. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=169.0s)]
*  They tried to contact Samaritan's Person. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=174.0s)]
*  They said, you're not in the emergency area yet. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=176.0s)]
*  They haven't designated that as the emergency area, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=179.0s)]
*  so we can't come and help or give you funding, so something needs to change. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=181.0s)]
*  Let's talk about also the firefighters, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=185.0s)]
*  because the union representing the firefighters [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=187.0s)]
*  is called International Association of Firefighters. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=189.0s)]
*  They are following the Teamsters example. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=192.0s)]
*  They're not endorsing Kamala Harris. What are your thoughts? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=194.0s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=198.0s)]
*  Listen, this is the second union in a row that has said they're not endorsing, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=199.0s)]
*  in part because they took polls of their own members, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=205.0s)]
*  and that tells you something, and it's this is the union [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=208.0s)]
*  that first endorsed President Biden, Joe Biden, Vice President at the time, in 2019. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=211.0s)]
*  They're choosing not to get in at this time after the Teamsters. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=217.0s)]
*  Overwhelmingly, to be fair, Vice President Harris has the backing of a lot of labor unions, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=221.0s)]
*  but this is an indication, and for the Trump campaign, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=226.0s)]
*  it's really good news in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=229.0s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about, speaking of unions, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=234.0s)]
*  you know, the last couple of days on our show and your show, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=236.0s)]
*  the number one story has been the dock workers walked off the job a couple of days ago [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=239.0s)]
*  because they wanted a 77% increase in pay. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=243.0s)]
*  Sounds like they have come to some sort of an agreement where they're now, today, back on the job. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=247.0s)]
*  They're going to get 60-something percent. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=253.0s)]
*  But isn't the political timing delicious? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=255.0s)]
*  Just the fact that they were so close to an election, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=258.0s)]
*  and every day the food supply or there's a supply chain issue continues, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=261.0s)]
*  it's not helpful to the woman who's the Vice President of the United States. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=268.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't know the back channel communications. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=273.0s)]
*  I do know that those companies were feeling the pinch as those ships were offshore, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=275.0s)]
*  and it was really building up. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=279.0s)]
*  62% wage increase, you know, that's what they're looking at, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=281.0s)]
*  but they have until January 15th to lock it in. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=285.0s)]
*  It's a good thing for the country that that's stopped, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=287.0s)]
*  because it would have been ugly after about a week. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=291.0s)]
*  But to tell you what, Fred, something that you, I know you're passionate about Atlanta. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=294.0s)]
*  You were in the Bureau for a while. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=298.0s)]
*  How significant is it that Brian Kemp, the governor, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=299.0s)]
*  and Donald Trump, the former president, have flared the hatchet, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=302.0s)]
*  appearing together for the first time in years? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=306.0s)]
*  And if you want a ground game that works, you call 1-800-BRIAN-KEMP, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=309.0s)]
*  and it seems like these two are going to be together. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=314.0s)]
*  They're saying it's not a campaign event, but what about seeing them together? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=316.0s)]
*  It's got to get Democrats upset, nervous. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=320.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=324.0s)]
*  I think Democrats really liked that feud that was the former president and the governor. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=325.0s)]
*  They have buried the hatchet, and we're told that that's moving forward. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=331.0s)]
*  When you have a machine, when you have a machine in any state, it makes a difference. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=335.0s)]
*  Georgia, he went up against Stacey Abrams and won. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=339.0s)]
*  He's an effective guy on the ground, Governor Kemp is, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=343.0s)]
*  so that union is probably good for the Trump campaign. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=346.0s)]
*  So, Brad, what do you make of the... [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=349.0s)]
*  I know Martin County went for Donald Trump, I think by a two-to-one margin. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=351.0s)]
*  So this is Trump country. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=356.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of flags. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=358.0s)]
*  I'm just driving around here. It's pretty amazing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=360.0s)]
*  Brad, real quickly, what do you make of the polling numbers right now? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=364.0s)]
*  Because it looks like Kamala Harris is under-polling Hillary as well as Joe Biden, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=369.0s)]
*  but you still look at these battlegrounds, they're still tight neck and neck. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=376.0s)]
*  What do you make of it? You've been doing it a long time. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=380.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've never seen it this tight, Lawrence. I really haven't. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=384.0s)]
*  If you look at every swing state, if you look at the seven toss-ups that we have, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=387.0s)]
*  it's within the margin of error. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=390.0s)]
*  And you talk about that, 30-plus days left to go. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=392.0s)]
*  Any one event late could change a few thousand votes and then change a state. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=396.0s)]
*  And so there's going to be a lot of mixing around here of who's up and who's down. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=402.0s)]
*  Right now, I'd say it's pretty tight. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=408.0s)]
*  Yeah, do you think the voter, after we've seen the debates, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=411.0s)]
*  we talk about this constantly, we know their records, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=414.0s)]
*  we know where they stand, but I was watching this morning another network, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=416.0s)]
*  and as I was getting ready, and I keep seeing this ad about how this lady, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=419.0s)]
*  her husband's in the military, so they have to move around state to state, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=423.0s)]
*  and they're trying to start a family, and she wants to do IVF. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=426.0s)]
*  She's scared if they move to another state where Donald Trump has taken away the IVF, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=429.0s)]
*  she's not going to be able to get it, which we know is all a lie. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=434.0s)]
*  So dumb. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=436.0s)]
*  Do the voters know the issues? What percentage would you say? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=437.0s)]
*  Listen, I think that, believe it or not, there are some people [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=443.0s)]
*  that are just starting to plug in to this whole thing. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=446.0s)]
*  We watch it every day, but there's a lot of folks that are just starting to get engaged. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=449.0s)]
*  So, you know, I'd say it's 50-50, people who really pay attention. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=453.0s)]
*  You know, ads can move the needle, but really I think it's the campaigns, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=457.0s)]
*  talking to people, these events, and the interviews. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=463.0s)]
*  You know, I commend that interview with Dave Ramsey that former President Trump did. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=466.0s)]
*  It was a really in-depth conversation about the economy, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=470.0s)]
*  and some of the best answers I've heard the former president give [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=473.0s)]
*  in the weeds on inflation and other things. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=477.0s)]
*  So, you know, more of those things for both sides would be good. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=480.0s)]
*  You were talking about talking to the people. I'm going to talk to them in a minute. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=484.0s)]
*  But first, some poll came out a couple of days ago [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=487.0s)]
*  that showed that Trump was only two points ahead of Harris in Florida. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=490.0s)]
*  Did you see that? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=494.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not buying that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=496.0s)]
*  I do think it's tighter than the 10-point spread that they thought they had. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=499.0s)]
*  I do think it's single digits. And Texas is a lot like that, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=503.0s)]
*  where you see Democrats feel like they have a chance, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=506.0s)]
*  and then it's like Lucy in the football with Charlie Brown. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=509.0s)]
*  You know, it gets pulled away at the last minute. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=512.0s)]
*  I think we've seen that before. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=515.0s)]
*  Okay. Listen, thank you very much for stopping by. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=517.0s)]
*  You know, you've got a couple of hours before the show. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=519.0s)]
*  Maybe you go have some breakfast, and then maybe some golf later today? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=522.0s)]
*  Yeah, all right. That's good. Thanks, guys. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyKGeK2djjk&t=526.0s)]
