# Trump 'standing by team' after alleged Atlantic war plan leak
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48)
*  Straight ahead congress is preparing to question Donald Trump officials today about a secret group chat after a journalist says the administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=0.0s)]
*  Accidentally texted him about imminent military strikes against the Houthi rebels in Yemen [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Brooke singman has the latest on this good morning Brooke. Good morning guys. That's right [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=12.76s)]
*  So D and I Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe are the first two who could be grilled by Congress with a hearing today [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=16.96s)]
*  Held by the Senate Intelligence Committee regarding worldwide threats [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=23.36s)]
*  So they are just two among the 18 people included in a group chat on the encrypted messaging service [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=26.88s)]
*  Signal and Jeffrey Goldberg the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic says he was accidentally added to the group that discussed war plans [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=32.72s)]
*  Against Houthi terror groups Goldberg sharing these texts showing top US national security officials [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  Discussing plans to carry out strikes in Yemen earlier this month including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth who is calling out the report listen to this [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=46.28s)]
*  You're talking about a [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=55.68s)]
*  Deceitful and highly discredited [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=58.6s)]
*  So-called journalists who's made a profession of peddling [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=61.24s)]
*  Hoaxes time and time again. Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say about that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=65.48s)]
*  Goldberg saying he was invited into the chat by President Trump's national security [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=71.88s)]
*  Advisor and that there was highly sensitive military information in those messages. I [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=76.2s)]
*  Was invited a couple of weeks ago [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=81.96s)]
*  To connect with Michael waltz the national security advisor that didn't strike me as particularly strange given my job and his job [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=84.36s)]
*  I was shared on a text in this group from somebody purporting to be Pete Hegseth the Secretary of Defense [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=91.52s)]
*  And this this text contained [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=99.84s)]
*  operational military information [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  Says he was not aware about the situation listen. I [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=105.28s)]
*  Don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of the Atlantic. It's to me. It's a magazine that's going out of business [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=108.68s)]
*  I think it's not much of a magazine, but I know nothing about it [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, it couldn't have been very effective because the attack was very effective. I can tell you that I don't know anything about it [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  You're telling me about it for the first time [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=124.34s)]
*  The White House says President Trump is standing by his team as the National Security Council [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  Confirms that the message thread reported appears to be authentic [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=131.8s)]
*  They are now investigating how the journalists number was added to that chain guys. Well, thank you very much Brooke [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=135.4s)]
*  Well, I read the article and it says that somebody identifying themselves as Mike waltz added that person [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=141.84s)]
*  I was talking to somebody in federal law enforcement last night and they said that just based on [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=148.72s)]
*  Having read the Atlantic article what was revealed was classified and top secret and this person has been down in DC for many [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=154.16s)]
*  Years has never heard of government officials at that level using signal for stuff like that and you know [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=162.92s)]
*  Kaylee having been in the White House. There are certain top secret [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=169.64s)]
*  gizmos and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=173.88s)]
*  Venues that they use and you don't use a commercial app that can be hacked [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, there's a channel that you're supposed to stay on with that kind of information now [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=180.84s)]
*  I heard someone on CNN suggesting maybe there were signal apps added to government devices somehow all that remains to me seen [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=184.72s)]
*  But I I imagine the White House press shop would have gotten that information out by now if that were the case [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=190.9s)]
*  Look, this was an obvious mistake [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=195.38s)]
*  Obviously, I will say, you know [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=197.86s)]
*  As my dad says when you eat crow you got to eat it hot and the National Security Council ate it while it was hot [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=199.94s)]
*  They did not try to deny this they came out [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  They said this appears to be authentic good on them [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=207.5s)]
*  The detail I'm wondering about is the Jeffrey Goldberg detail about war plans [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=209.9s)]
*  He says there were operational details, but he did not want to share them because it would be compromising [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=214.94s)]
*  I don't trust Jeffrey Goldberg the last time I sat on the couch with you guys [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=220.16s)]
*  He had the ridiculous story about Vanessa Jill Gullion. He had the suckers and losers [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=223.46s)]
*  He is it not a credible reporter and how does this most horrific of all reporters in Washington DC? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=227.6s)]
*  Get added to your text chain. There are a lot of questions [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=234.24s)]
*  So that's that's literally my only question as it relates to government officials [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=237.52s)]
*  Using signal they all use it. They're not supposed to but they use it but not because secret stuff they use it [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  CIA every single intelligence agency uses signal. I know that for a fact I talked to them on signal [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=250.28s)]
*  They're sources of mind. They all use signal [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=256.9s)]
*  It is the best way and the most secure way to get information out [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's why a lot of journalists lose use it as well [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=265.66s)]
*  But they don't want it. They're not supposed to do it, but they do it anyway [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=269.04s)]
*  I don't understand how he got on this chain, especially when you add someone to signal [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=272.48s)]
*  That shows you that someone else if you don't have their contact there's that there's someone that's new that's been adding to it [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=278.08s)]
*  Why all of those people that were on that chain didn't say who is this person that's on the chain? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=284.48s)]
*  That wasn't saved in their contact. I don't know they need to get to the bottom of that. Also. I'm curious [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=291.24s)]
*  Whoever did end up adding him. Why are you communicating with this guy? Yeah, you should not be communicating with this [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=296.36s)]
*  Is not the person not be communicating with right? It's a highly sensitive time [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=302.36s)]
*  They obviously thought they were just talking to each other [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=306.32s)]
*  The context of it to push back from JD Vance on the operation is fine [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=308.76s)]
*  I have no problem with that if you could respect somebody and have a different opinion people have hung up on that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=313.04s)]
*  We know where you stand is one thing obviously to me was a mistake [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=318.8s)]
*  But when I'm reading in Politico that Mike Walters in trouble and you know [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=323.6s)]
*  I think that there's not a chance in heck the thing that gets you in trouble with President Trump is disloyalty and duplicity [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=328.34s)]
*  Not mistakes in my view you work for him. We've known him for 20. I've known him for a long time [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  That's my view and if something was gonna happen they would have brought it up already [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=342.35999999999996s)]
*  I'm curious to see what the fallout is but expect every Democrat to say I finally got something [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=347.2s)]
*  This is something they're gonna focus on as the house is in session [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=352.56s)]
*  That's right [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=356.0s)]
*  And they're going to start today and so they have given the you know the Democrats now have a tangible [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=356.56s)]
*  Hammer to hit the administration with and it's worth mentioning the Houthi strike was was very successful so operationally it went off without a hitch [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z39C9og-Y48&t=362.40000000000003s)]
