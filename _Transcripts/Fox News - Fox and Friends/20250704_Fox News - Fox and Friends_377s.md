# ‘LFG!!!’: ICE morale SOARS after ‘big, beautiful bill’ passes
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw)
*  the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to talk about just how significant the largest infusion of border resources we are getting in the big beautiful bill every border official I've ever talked to said there's 3 things you need to secure our nation infrastructure manpower and technology let's break down a 100 billion a huge 46 and a half billion for border wall construction upgrades and the detection technology [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=4.0s)]
*  while the numbers are lower than they've ever been the wall is what works every border patrol official has told me that and they're going to continue to build it now you've also got to talk about why so many people released under the Biden years it's because they ran out of places to hold them they told us we have nowhere to house them so we have to release them well we're talking about 45 billion for single adult detention in family residential centers that's going to be for temporary places kind of like alligator Alcatraz we hear where as I [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=29.0s)]
*  ice arrest the criminal migrant illegal aliens in the interior of the country the other place to put them as they make their way out of the country you've got nearly 30 billion for hiring training and retention of ice officers technology in transport they are at a level now where if they get this resources they can really move and ultimately get the more than 400,000 criminal illegal aliens we know are in our country finally for just over 4 billion for the hiring [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=59.0s)]
*  training for border patrol agents and others while numbers are down on the southern border we still need people to walk the line there a 100 billion total so to discuss it nobody better than the acting ice director Todd lines Mister director happy 4th of July thank you for taking time and I would just start Todd with getting your perspective on how significant this bill is in these resources will be for ice. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=89.02s)]
*  Hey Griff thanks for having me and happy 4th of July to you and everyone on the staff. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=116.28s)]
*  No it's gonna be great. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=119.98s)]
*  I mean when you think about how depleted ice has been over the past four years they last administration totally minimize the work the men and women of ice do every day. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=120.86s)]
*  It really cut our resources. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=130.14000000000001s)]
*  So you're seeing now under this administration President Trump has made a promise to the American people to make America safe again. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=131.62s)]
*  And a key part of that is his immigration strategy and what Secretary Noem has done with helping craft this bill. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=137.82s)]
*  It's been amazing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=143.98s)]
*  Just like you said the detention space alone is going to be huge for us. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=145.02s)]
*  We saw so many individuals let into the country last time without due proper vetting. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=148.56s)]
*  We saw some we know we have so many known gotaways no suspected terrorists. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=154.3s)]
*  This is going to give us the tools and resources now to have the infrastructure in place to go ahead and ensure that ice is going out and be in that viable law enforcement partner we are and going after all these public safety threats. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=158.74s)]
*  And the one main thing that you pointed out is the manpower and hiring. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=170.54000000000002s)]
*  We've lost so many good men and women because they just didn't feel like they were law enforcement officers anymore. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=174.46s)]
*  When you're just not allowed to do your job it's very heartbreaking. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=179.9s)]
*  So now we're going to have the opportunity to get men and women of ice the backup they need. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=183.18s)]
*  We're going to be able to retain these great individuals. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  So it's going to be a great win for the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=190.98000000000002s)]
*  Well Mr. Director it seems that morale is up. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=194.10000000000002s)]
*  Our friend and my colleague in common Bill Mollusk and getting some reaction from some of your ice officers saying things like this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  This is long overdue will give us the resources to ramp it up and give the American people what they voted for. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=207.7s)]
*  This ensures that ice is the tip of the spear to make America safe again. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  You know you really. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=219.26s)]
*  And of course the smiley face emoji and then the last one there this administration has been fighting nonstop to give the law enforcement agents in these dangerous sanctuary communities the tools we need to complete the mission. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=220.22s)]
*  As you talk about giving your men and women what they need Todd you're facing a backlash the likes of which ice has never seen from agents being doxxed and assaults now on your ice officers. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=231.94s)]
*  Up nearly 700 percent as you already have some California cities canceling their Fourth of July events today to literally have a response to protect migrants from ice rage you see him here L.A. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=247.73999999999998s)]
*  County Whittier Bell Gardens in Cotter Hay as well just out of control. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=259.62s)]
*  What are you saying to your rank and file. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  What are you saying to your team. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=267.74s)]
*  Well you know like you said assaults are up to almost 700 percent and that's totally unreal and it's unacceptable. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=269.7s)]
*  The men and women of ice are out there doing a law enforcement mission never in my career or my lifetime would I think that we'd see people attacking law enforcement officers for arresting the worst of the worst with that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=275.86s)]
*  What I have to say about these events being canceled it's ludicrous. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=288.06s)]
*  Ice isn't going out to events and arresting and rounding people up right. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=291.74s)]
*  What ice is doing and the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security is keeping America safe this Fourth of July. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=295.34000000000003s)]
*  So what I can tell you is not only my agency but all the department agency components have been out there working with state and local officials to ensure that things like the sleeper cell threats these known or suspected terrorists that came in aren't going to affect our Fourth of July weekend and that Americans can go out and celebrate. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=300.58s)]
*  So what we should be focused on is what the good work that the men and women of ice are doing to protect this nation. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=317.09999999999997s)]
*  You know you guys have highlighted Griff what we've done with some of the high threat countries. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=322.62s)]
*  We arrested a former sniper from one of these high risk countries. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=327.46s)]
*  We arrested an Iranian that was tied to Hezbollah. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=330.3s)]
*  We are out there ensuring that these people that were let in under the last administration aren't going to do us harm on a great day like July 4th. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=332.65999999999997s)]
*  You know just in the last few seconds I've got Todd we're doing proud American shout outs all day. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=339.34s)]
*  How proud are you of your men and women of ice. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=344.9s)]
*  You know it's such an honor of a lifetime to be able to lead the men and women of ice. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=348.3s)]
*  They are the bravest law enforcement officers out there today. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=351.34s)]
*  They do great work and I'm so proud to be on here every day to explain the great work that they do for this country. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=354.06s)]
*  We're doing a great job acting ice director Todd Lyons. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=359.7s)]
*  Thank you for taking time and giving us your insight today. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=362.34s)]
*  Have a happy Fourth of July. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDwspAapPUw&t=365.46s)]
