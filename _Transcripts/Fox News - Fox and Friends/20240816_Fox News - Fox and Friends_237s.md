# 'TERRIBLE': Harris-Walz roasted for awkward interview
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0)
*  Well, everyone's been wondering where she is. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=0.0s)]
*  Like, why doesn't she talk to the press? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=2.0s)]
*  Why isn't she giving this sit-down interview [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=3.92s)]
*  to some agency, to some news agency? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=6.2s)]
*  And we want to hear more about her policies. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=9.32s)]
*  If you go to her website, there's nothing on there. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=11.8s)]
*  Apparently, she's rolling out this economic policy today. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  People are curious about what she stands for, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=16.72s)]
*  even though we know her voting record. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=18.72s)]
*  But she hasn't sat down in 26 days, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=20.56s)]
*  but she did release a video of Tim Walz. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=23.12s)]
*  So there was an interview. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=27.0s)]
*  They're interviewing each other. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=28.44s)]
*  Oh, fantastic. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=29.64s)]
*  Watch a little clip of this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=30.76s)]
*  I have white guy tacos and black pepper. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=33.52s)]
*  Like mayonnaise and tuna? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=35.96s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=37.36s)]
*  Pretty much ground beef and cheese. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=38.16s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=39.88s)]
*  Do you put any flavor in it? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=40.4s)]
*  No. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=41.96s)]
*  They said to be careful and let her know this, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=42.92s)]
*  that black pepper is the top of the spice level in Minnesota. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=44.8s)]
*  Black pepper. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=48.36s)]
*  Well, but why is Kamala an expert on tacos? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Good point. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  That's what your takeaway? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=55.08s)]
*  I ain't going. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=56.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=56.72s)]
*  She's dunking on him about tacos. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=58.18s)]
*  What is she? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=60.98s)]
*  I mean, I don't understand her expertise on tacos. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=61.78s)]
*  Will is so desperate for some unscripted moments. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=63.74s)]
*  And she went with, did she say white guy tacos [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=66.58s)]
*  or tuna and mayonnaise? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=70.58s)]
*  Well, that wasn't the worst part. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=72.02s)]
*  He said white guy tacos. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=73.22s)]
*  And then she said, what is that? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=74.18s)]
*  Tuna and mayonnaise? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=75.22s)]
*  Tuna and mayonnaise, yeah. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=75.94s)]
*  She couldn't even really get to what album she really likes [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=76.9s)]
*  and why. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=80.18s)]
*  She just says all of it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=80.66s)]
*  They talked about music. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=81.62s)]
*  He says he's Bruce Springsteen. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=82.74s)]
*  She said Aretha and Miles. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=84.18s)]
*  Then they talked about cars. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=87.41999999999999s)]
*  She owned an orange Chevy Camaro. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=89.1s)]
*  That was his first car with an eight track. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  And so it was just a, we learned nothing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=93.22s)]
*  First of all, you can't say, I mean, the producer's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=97.38s)]
*  like, no issues. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=101.1s)]
*  I'm going to get to the issue. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=102.74s)]
*  But it's also, it doesn't make any sense. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=104.74s)]
*  You don't say Aretha Franklin and say all of them. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=107.46s)]
*  You don't put the greatest or Miles Davis [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=110.25999999999999s)]
*  and say, yeah, all of the artists as well. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=113.78s)]
*  They're the greatest for a reason. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=116.7s)]
*  But again, even when she has just simple human moments [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=118.34s)]
*  where she should be able to go back and forth, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=123.34s)]
*  she's just terrible. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=126.10000000000001s)]
*  Everyone on social media was saying this was fake. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  This was scripted. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=129.18s)]
*  This was phony. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=130.34s)]
*  And they said, you can't do interviews, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=131.62s)]
*  so you have to talk to each other. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=133.46s)]
*  They wanted to create chemistry. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=135.3s)]
*  These two were born to run together. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=136.58s)]
*  Can I just confess, though? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=138.58s)]
*  She's like, you would have been my friend. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=140.54s)]
*  We grew up in the same neighborhood. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=142.38s)]
*  I'm like, no, y'all probably would not have done that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=143.78s)]
*  From a political standpoint, I get [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=146.14000000000001s)]
*  why they're not putting her out. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=148.98s)]
*  Like from a strictly, if you don't care about the press [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=150.78s)]
*  holding people accountable, keep her away from the cameras. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=156.18s)]
*  Have you ever seen all the stuff about LeBron James carrying [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=160.9s)]
*  books out and putting them in press conferences? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=163.34s)]
*  Yeah, and it's always on the first page. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=164.5s)]
*  It's always on the first page. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=165.9s)]
*  And then you ask LeBron, what's your favorite part? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=166.7s)]
*  And he's like, all the parts. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=168.22s)]
*  All of it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=169.3s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=170.1s)]
*  Is that what she's doing with who your favorite music is? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=171.22s)]
*  Aretha? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=173.62s)]
*  All of them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=174.12s)]
*  She just really doesn't know. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=174.62s)]
*  It's just an endless thing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, if she said if she didn't have any of their favorites, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=178.54s)]
*  that would be weird. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  And you just don't want to be weird. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=182.62s)]
*  Don't say weird. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=183.94s)]
*  That's apparently the truth. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  And it's the Portland and Austin slogan. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=186.22s)]
*  Keep Portland weird, keep Austin weird. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=189.38s)]
*  So that whole weird thing, I don't get it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=191.54000000000002s)]
*  Me neither. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=195.34s)]
*  Because I thought, especially that party, the nose rings, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=196.58s)]
*  the purple hair, the pink squeegee, pink hair. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=199.54000000000002s)]
*  I thought you're supposed to accept everybody. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=201.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=203.26000000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=203.82000000000002s)]
*  And all of a sudden, it's like, I don't like this guy [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=204.14000000000001s)]
*  because Ron Howard did a movie on his life. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=206.38000000000002s)]
*  And his book was a best-seller for three years. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  He's weird because he's wearing a Navy suit. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=212.38000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=214.70000000000002s)]
*  No purple hair. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=215.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  No tongue piercings. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=217.22000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=219.10000000000002s)]
*  When normal is weird again. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=220.14000000000001s)]
*  That should be our slogan. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=222.66000000000003s)]
*  Maybe we'll change it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=224.22000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=225.38000000000002s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEebPB7jP0&t=227.06s)]
