# Kamala Harris may visit border during swing state visit
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U)
*  What's the next step in terms of Harris? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=0.0s)]
*  So she wants to let everyone know she's going to tackle inflation. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=2.0s)]
*  She also wants to let everybody know that she's going to tackle the border. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=5.0s)]
*  And rumor is she's going to head to the border on Friday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=8.0s)]
*  That's going to be interesting if she's going to go to the part of the border wall that President Trump's administration built. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=11.0s)]
*  This is going to be something that she's not really done before that we could see. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=15.0s)]
*  And the question she always comes back when you talk about the border, she goes, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=19.0s)]
*  I'm the only one to prosecute transnational gangs. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=22.0s)]
*  You know what? She did in 2012 and 2014. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=25.0s)]
*  But I checked the calendar. It is 2024. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=27.0s)]
*  The real question to her should be when you had powerful positions like senator from California and vice president of the United States, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=29.0s)]
*  what did you do? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=37.0s)]
*  And the answer is didn't even swing, didn't even miss, didn't care. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=38.0s)]
*  When you were given the assignment, you punted on it, went one time in and out in 45 minutes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=43.0s)]
*  Yeah, funny you should bring up her time as a senator because she was in a parade in L.A. back in 2018. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=49.0s)]
*  She was the grand marshal because she was a senator. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=54.0s)]
*  She was there with her family and Jesse Smollett, who a year later was found guilty of conducting that hoax hate crime saying he was cheated up by the MAGA people. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=57.0s)]
*  So she's in this she's in this parade and some new video of this parade is resurfaced and it shows her protesting against deporting migrants. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=64.0s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=74.0s)]
*  So there's been no examination from the other newscasters about records like this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=84.0s)]
*  She was a radical. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=97.0s)]
*  And the question is, is she just doing this as a matter of convenience now saying that's not what she's going to do when she becomes United States president? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=98.0s)]
*  Many people, I tend to believe that this is just a ploy to get through this general election and the real Kamala Harris is finally going to stand up once she has the pen and have control of Congress if the American people send her there. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=107.0s)]
*  I mean, this is not the only radical position that she has as well. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=122.0s)]
*  The funding of sex changes for illegals that come across the border. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=125.0s)]
*  She wants to decriminalize the folks that are coming across the border. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=128.0s)]
*  She wants to defund ICE. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=132.0s)]
*  So that means no deportation deportations at all. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=133.0s)]
*  That's what you get with a Kamala Harris president. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=137.0s)]
*  Well, when she was running for president, she took a bunch of far left positions that now she's trying to back away from Axios actually as a report on what you know, she was very clear in 2019 about what she wanted to do. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=139.0s)]
*  They've got a headline Harris pledged in 2019 to take four executive actions as president would that would give two million dreamers a path to citizenship and shield more than six million undocumented migrants from deportation. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=152.0s)]
*  Ask this week whether she'd take those same executive actions. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=165.0s)]
*  Her campaign declined to answer. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=168.0s)]
*  And that's what the campaign does, because they won't tell us exactly if she is elected, what she would do because they want people just to kind of have a fuzzy feeling about things. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=171.0s)]
*  She's obviously going to the southern border on Friday and it sounds like she's going to give a speech. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=181.0s)]
*  It's about time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=186.0s)]
*  It is about time. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=187.0s)]
*  But here's here's why she's going. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=188.0s)]
*  And we've talked a lot about how she is trailing Donald Trump by a lot when it comes to the border in Arizona, according to the New York Times poll that came out yesterday in Arizona. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=190.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is beating her by 11 points in Arizona. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=201.0s)]
*  Both of them want to win that state. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=206.0s)]
*  But right now, Donald Trump is only ahead by one point in the in the big number in Arizona. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=208.0s)]
*  So if she could 11 points on the border. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=214.0s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=217.0s)]
*  Eleven points on the border, but only one point overall. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=218.0s)]
*  So if she could peel off a couple of points of people who think that Donald Trump would do a better job, that would be a win. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=221.0s)]
*  Well, she did. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=229.0s)]
*  You saw her down down with deportation. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=230.0s)]
*  Well, she did that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=232.0s)]
*  She followed through with her goal when she was vice president. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=233.0s)]
*  And the latest data has been released under the Biden and Harris administration. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=235.0s)]
*  There was a 67 percent decline in removals of illegals compared to the Trump administration in his first three years. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=239.0s)]
*  He deported four hundred eighty five thousand nine hundred thirty. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=246.0s)]
*  So almost five hundred thousand under Biden Harris, one hundred and fifty eight thousand nine hundred and thirty one illegals removed. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=249.0s)]
*  So the question is, it's a risk. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=255.0s)]
*  You could go down there and act tough on the border. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=257.0s)]
*  The problem is you have a reputation for not being tough. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=259.0s)]
*  And when you show up there, it's going to make everyone ask themselves, do I envision her enforcing the border and getting my small town back? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=262.0s)]
*  Also, are what is your stand when it comes to these flights from other countries right into small airports in places like Westchester and Long Island and in Pennsylvania? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=271.0s)]
*  Where do you stand on that? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=280.0s)]
*  And the thing is, do you can you ever imagine Donald Trump's organization campaign responding? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=282.0s)]
*  No comment to anything to do with the border. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=288.0s)]
*  You know, exactly. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=291.0s)]
*  But perhaps she can also give an apology to those border agents. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=292.0s)]
*  And she like citing them so much that she lied and said they were whipping Haitian migrants. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=296.0s)]
*  It would be an appropriate time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=301.0s)]
*  So that's been disproven multiple times. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=302.0s)]
*  Maybe she should shake their hand. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=305.0s)]
*  If you change your position, you at least tell the American people a reason why I change. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=307.0s)]
*  I realize I was wrong. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=313.0s)]
*  I realize in looking at the numbers, I had a very, very revealing meeting with an expert on what the damage that was done over the last four years. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=315.0s)]
*  Just saying I changed and will not answer any questions. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=325.0s)]
*  Sixty five days from when you announced your candidacy about five different things. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=329.0s)]
*  At least she's at least. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=334.0s)]
*  She's got a lot of explaining to do. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW6aQz86-U&t=336.0s)]
