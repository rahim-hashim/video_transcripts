# This is a win for Hamas: Tim Kennedy
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4)
*  So our next guest knows all about rescuing victims from terror hotbeds, retired Army Ranger, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=0.0s)]
*  and Save Our Allies co-founder Tim Kennedy joins us. Now Tim, you're a door kicker, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=4.88s)]
*  you know exactly what it takes to do HR, hostage rescue, but with this new deal in place, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  what are your main concerns? It was a win-win for the Hamas. You know, either Israel agrees to it [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=14.64s)]
*  and they have to release 150 terrorists, or they have another huge PR problem of not allowing the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=23.76s)]
*  hostages to come out. So you know Hamas yet again is winning the information war. Yeah, it continues [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=36.24s)]
*  to be a big concern that people are buying the propaganda, but I think going back to your second [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=44.0s)]
*  point is that they're having some of these hostages that are going to just return these, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=49.84s)]
*  I'm sorry, some of these folks that have already been captured by Israel return to the battlefield, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=54.96s)]
*  and this is the same thing we saw with Eli Shalit. You got one person that was a hostage, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  and then you got over a thousand terrorists that returned to the battlefield. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=66.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's not sustainable. You know, on October 7th when Hamas returned back to Gaza, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=72.72s)]
*  they were celebrated as victors. They killed 1,400 people. They took 240 hostages, you know, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=80.16s)]
*  raping and torturing 80% of all of their victims, and they were celebrated on their return. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=86.8s)]
*  This is a win for Hamas. You know, Israel is doing the best they can, but they are fighting a terrorist [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=92.72s)]
*  organization, a terrorist organization that took women and children and Holocaust survivors captive. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=98.56s)]
*  So evil. Brother, I want to get your comment on another topic. So the U.S. finally carried out an [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=106.08s)]
*  airstrike last night, killing five Iraqi militia members. I wanted to get your comment on this [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=110.64s)]
*  because the White House was, there's been about 66 attacks on U.S. forces since October the 17th, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  and the White House, I'm sorry, the Pentagon deputy press secretary was asked about this, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=123.04s)]
*  and she said this, and about the response and deterrence. She said, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=128.4s)]
*  Right now we are seeing non-serious injuries, minor damage to infrastructure [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=131.84s)]
*  in comparison to weapons facilities being destroyed. So as a former door kicker, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=136.8s)]
*  do you see TBIs as just minor injuries? No. As we are guaranteeing after the global war on terror, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=142.32s)]
*  these have long-lasting effects, you know, both on mental health, but, you know, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=152.4s)]
*  our war fighters are struggling with cancer, they're fighting suicide, and, you know, obviously [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=156.88s)]
*  reintegration back into American civilian life. We have to continue to put pressure on these [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  terrorist organizations. The fact that they've had this many attacks on Americans, I'm sorry, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=170.8s)]
*  my voice is so trashed, I was skydiving in Moab yesterday, it's like moon dust there. But, you [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=176.0s)]
*  know, we have to keep the pressure on these violent extremist organizations. We have to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=181.76s)]
*  eradicate them. These are the groups that will kill anyone anytime they'll take women and children [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  hostage. 66 attacks, it's unheard of. And even if they're minor injuries against Americans, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  this is an act of war against an American soldier. Let's treat it as such. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=197.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's so true. You know, Tim, it wasn't enough that you dedicated your life over a decade [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=201.28s)]
*  jumping out of planes to save us. Now you just go skydiving for a little bit of fun as well, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=207.76s)]
*  brother. I wish you well. If you want to donate, go to saveourallies.com. Appreciate you coming [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  on the program. Thanks, Lawrence. You got it, brother. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pVB_d0-t-4&t=218.79999999999998s)]
