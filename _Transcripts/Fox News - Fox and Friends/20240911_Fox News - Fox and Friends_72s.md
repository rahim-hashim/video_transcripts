**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE)
*  Hey, I've got a quick question for you. Out of nowhere, after the debate last night, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE&t=0.0s)]
*  Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris. What do you think? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Well, I actually like Mrs. — I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better, if you want to know the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE&t=8.8s)]
*  truth. She's a big Trump fan. I was not a Taylor Swift fan. It was just a question of time. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE&t=17.52s)]
*  She couldn't — you couldn't possibly endorse Biden. You look at Biden, you couldn't possibly [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE&t=23.84s)]
*  endorse him. But she's a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE&t=28.88s)]
*  and she'll probably pay a price for it at the — in the marketplace. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE&t=34.48s)]
*  But no, I like Britney. I think Britney's great. Britney, we just got a lot of news last week. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE&t=38.72s)]
*  She's a big — she's a big MAGA fan. That's the one I like much better than Taylor Swift. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE&t=43.92s)]
*  Right. Yeah, Britney is — [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE&t=48.4s)]
*  Mahomes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, they're — Mahomes, they're great friends. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE&t=52.16s)]
*  The wife of the great quarterback, and he is a great quarterback. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE&t=54.32s)]
*  My favorite team from Kansas City. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE&t=57.12s)]
*  I think she's terrific. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAW4HFD86rE&t=59.44s)]
