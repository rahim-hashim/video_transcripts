# AOC has found her 'mini-me,' Republican strategist says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY)
*  So the Democrat Party remains at a crossroads as it outlines a blueprint for Project 2029, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=0.0s)]
*  a not-so-subtle play on Project 2025. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=7.24s)]
*  The goal is to mirror the strategy of Project 2025 with a more politically-centered team [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=10.92s)]
*  in order to unite Democrats on key policy issues. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=16.36s)]
*  But many Democrats are worried it will only deepen their divide. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=20.2s)]
*  Here to discuss, Kevin Walling, Democrat strategist and former surrogate for the Biden-Harris [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=23.96s)]
*  campaign and Katie Frost, Republican strategist. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=28.36s)]
*  So, Kevin, I really am curious to hear what is, because I'm genuinely confused about where [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=32.16s)]
*  Democrats are today, what's the Project 2029 going to look like? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=39.16s)]
*  Hey, Charlie. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=44.8s)]
*  Good morning and happy fourth. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=45.8s)]
*  Listen, you know, I don't know much about this Project 2029. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=47.36s)]
*  I'm focused on Project 2025. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=51.08s)]
*  We've got two key elections coming up in New Jersey and Virginia with two centers, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=52.92s)]
*  and we've got two very pragmatic women that are leading the Democratic Party in those states. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=57.68s)]
*  I suspect they will be elected in both of those states come November. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=61.44s)]
*  And then, of course, we've got the midterm. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=66.4s)]
*  So any focus of 2029, I want to focus on the here and now and supporting center-left pragmatic [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=67.72s)]
*  candidates for public office. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=74.4s)]
*  That's where my politics are as a centrist Democrat. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=75.76s)]
*  We know that's the way that we win elections, especially in tough districts that are red or purple districts. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=79.16s)]
*  Many of them are in play for 2026. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=85.92s)]
*  So that timing and that effort starts now. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=89.32s)]
*  Who cares about 2029? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=92.24s)]
*  Let's focus on what's in front of us right now and supporting candidates that support [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  that center-left pragmatic. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=97.84s)]
*  Let's get things done. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=100.52s)]
*  Let's work with the president where we can and stand up for what we believe on the Hill [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=101.88s)]
*  and in state legislatures. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=105.8s)]
*  Well, certainly it would be good for all of America if we had two sane parties and not [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=107.6s)]
*  just one mostly sane party and one perfectly, completely, totally insane party. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=113.16s)]
*  But Katie, I want you to listen to this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=120.28s)]
*  This is a montage of some of the things that Democrats nominee for mayor in New York has [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=121.72s)]
*  said. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=128.72s)]
*  This is Zoran Mamdani. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=129.72s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=130.72s)]
*  Our police force should not be assisting ICE. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=132.68s)]
*  Defund the NYPD and refund all of these different social services. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  I will create a network of city-owned grocery stores. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=140.4s)]
*  It's like a public option for produce. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=142.96s)]
*  I'll freeze the rent for millions of tenants, make buses fast and free, and deliver universal [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=145.16s)]
*  child care. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=149.56s)]
*  And before you ask, I'll pay for it by taxing the rich. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=150.56s)]
*  As mayor, New York City would arrest Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=153.52s)]
*  So whether Kevin likes it or not, these are the questions that Democrats are going to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=157.72s)]
*  have to answer going forward. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=161.76s)]
*  Do you think that they're going to be able to sell government-run grocery stores and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  then defunding police and ICE? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=167.88s)]
*  Well, it's great to be with you, Charlie. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=169.72s)]
*  No, they won't. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=172.96s)]
*  You know, ever since November, the Democratic Party has been desperately searching for a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=173.96s)]
*  message and a messenger. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=177.88s)]
*  We've seen them have different politicians going out, whether it be Governor Walz or [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=179.84s)]
*  AOC trying to audition for that role of leader of the Democratic Party. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  And now AOC has found her mini-me in this radical Democratic socialist Mamdani to be [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=188.88s)]
*  the mayor of New York. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=193.76s)]
*  And his policies may go over well at the teachers' lounge at Columbia University, but they're [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=195.12s)]
*  not going to resonate with the American people. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=200.12s)]
*  The folks watching at home know what kind of impact these policies would have, and they're [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  not going to fall for it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  If the Democrats want to win a national election again, they are going to have to get away [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  from these radical policies to bring back those people into the party that President [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=212.72s)]
*  Trump drew in 2024. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=217.24s)]
*  As far as Project 2029 goes, I can tell you what it's going to be. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=219.44s)]
*  We already know. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=223.24s)]
*  It happened under Joe Biden's presidency. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=224.28s)]
*  It was Project 2021. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=226.52s)]
*  The American people remember how disastrous that was. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=228.52s)]
*  If you have Jake Sullivan doing your foreign policy, you get the disastrous withdrawal [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=231.16s)]
*  from Afghanistan of 13 men and women dead. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=234.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=236.96s)]
*  Well, you know, Kevin, Katie makes a good point there. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=237.96s)]
*  You know, I appreciate your wanting to drag the Democrat Party more towards a centrist [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=240.36s)]
*  position, but you're going to have to answer to all of those accusations. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=245.84s)]
*  And people can point to real policies. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=252.08s)]
*  Well, sure, Charlie. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=253.84s)]
*  And listen, you know, I have an op-ed out this past week on FoxNews.com making the case [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=255.84s)]
*  that Mondami is not the leader of the Democratic Party, no matter how hard Republicans try [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=260.08000000000004s)]
*  and make that the case. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=264.88s)]
*  You know, he won in a deeply blue city like New York City. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=265.88s)]
*  I make the case that two women, Mikey Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, are two nominees, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=270.0s)]
*  as I said before, in New Jersey, and Virginia for governor, are the actual leaders of this [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=274.6s)]
*  party that have won statewide, that have a record of bipartisanship, that have a record [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=280.04s)]
*  of delivering on infrastructure, on projects back in their states, that are campaigning [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=284.44s)]
*  on those issues. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=288.76000000000005s)]
*  And I want to focus on uplifting those voices. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=289.82s)]
*  I want a big 10 as possible as a Democrat, certainly. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  But those are the voices I'm uplifting, you know, on Fox and across the country. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=294.74s)]
*  Katie, real quick, we got to go. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=299.92s)]
*  But are you looking forward to defending the big, beautiful bill going into 2026? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=301.48s)]
*  Absolutely, because there's actual real policy in it that's going to benefit the American [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=307.24s)]
*  people, no matter what our friends on the other side of the aisle try to say about it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=312.44s)]
*  This was a huge win for President Trump. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=316.12s)]
*  He's actually delivering for the American people. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  And I'll put his accomplishments up against someone like AOC or Mondani or any other Democrat [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=320.08s)]
*  any day of the week. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=324.88s)]
*  Katie Frost, Kevin Walling, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=325.88s)]
*  Thanks, Charlie. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=328.64s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_7xeseeDY&t=329.64s)]
