# Biden admin spins criticism of disaster response as 'misinformation'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI)
*  You know, firstly was deep fakes and now the White House is spinning another deflection [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=0.0s)]
*  as they take heat over the federal hurricane response. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=5.12s)]
*  See if you can notice a thread. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=8.76s)]
*  There's a lot of misinformation and I beseech you, I beg you to please not pay attention [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=11.32s)]
*  to it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=16.92s)]
*  Sir, what's the risk of political figures sharing misinformation during this time? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=17.92s)]
*  It misleads people, puts people in circumstances where they panic, where they're really, really, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=23.2s)]
*  really worried. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  So I'm going to divorce the disinformation that is being spread from any one individual [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  and just say this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=35.28s)]
*  Disinformation harms survivors of a disaster because they lose trust in their government. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=37.6s)]
*  There's not enough money right now for people in North Carolina. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=44.2s)]
*  That's not misinformation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  Wait, no that is, your whole premise of the question is misinformation, sir. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  What you don't, yes, yes, it's misinformation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=54.72s)]
*  And it's there. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  You can't call a question that you don't like misinformation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  I know that guy. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=59.56s)]
*  Miranda Devine is the author of a brand new book. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=62.32s)]
*  It's called The Big Guy, How a President and His Son Sold Out America. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=64.36s)]
*  She joins us right now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=68.28s)]
*  Miranda, good morning to you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=69.28s)]
*  Good morning, Steve. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=72.28s)]
*  Okay, so that's what the White House is doing now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=73.28s)]
*  They're saying anything they don't like is oftentimes misinformation or disinformation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  Even though Mayorkas himself came out a couple of days ago and said, you know what, we don't [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=80.84s)]
*  have, after Helene, we don't have enough money for the rest of hurricane season. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=84.88s)]
*  Peter's question was not disinformation or misinformation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=90.8s)]
*  That was just a fact. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=93.96s)]
*  It was, but it shows you how damaging politically they think their botched response to Hurricane [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=97.72s)]
*  Helene has been. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=104.12s)]
*  They have brought up the big guns, which is of course their accusation that anyone making [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=105.96s)]
*  politically damaging statements to them is peddling misinformation. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=111.2s)]
*  I'm really surprised that they didn't wheel out the old one that they used on the laptop [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=117.0s)]
*  from hell, which was Russian disinformation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=121.4s)]
*  This is just their go to when they're in trouble. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  And it's quite sinister given the threats that both Kamala Harris and Tim Waltz have [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=128.08s)]
*  made about free speech. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=134.4s)]
*  They say that there's no guarantee to free speech when it comes to what they deem to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=136.56s)]
*  be misinformation or disinformation. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=141.72s)]
*  They will bring down the heavy hammer of censorship. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=144.96s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=147.84s)]
*  And so this week they're using disinformation, misinformation. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=148.84s)]
*  I remember it was last month after the guy was in the hedge line in the tree line down [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=152.88s)]
*  at Trump National and Peter Ducey asked Corrine Jean-Pierre about, you know, how many assassination [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=160.84s)]
*  attempts do there have to be on the former president before you people stop calling him [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=167.6s)]
*  a threat? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=172.66s)]
*  And she said that question was dangerous. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  It's not a dangerous question. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=176.89999999999998s)]
*  They were using that word. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=178.2s)]
*  And so it's just one of those things. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=179.76s)]
*  They're trying to shut people down by saying, oh, you're dangerous. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  You are spreading misinformation, mister. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=185.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=190.32s)]
*  Look, it is a threat to journalism. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=191.32s)]
*  It's a threat to free speech. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=193.84s)]
*  And it's one that they have freely wielded before. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=195.6s)]
*  We've seen them threaten social media and social media therefore has censored people, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=198.48s)]
*  whether it's about COVID-19 or, you know, rude memes about the first lady or Hunter [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=203.76s)]
*  Biden's laptop. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=210.28s)]
*  They've censored American speech. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=211.88s)]
*  And now what they're saying is, if you dare raise any embarrassing fact, like the fact [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=214.24s)]
*  that FEMA was handing out money to illegal migrants instead of keeping it for hurricane [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=222.68s)]
*  victims, like the fact that Peter Ducey mentioned in that question that Corrine Jean-Pierre [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=228.8s)]
*  labelled misinformation, which was that the administration has no problem bringing out [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  $160 million to Lebanon for humanitarian relief, but says it needs to go to Congress to give [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=241.72s)]
*  hurricane victims relief. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=248.4s)]
*  And it's all about, you know, this idea that Biden and Harris put America last. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=250.48s)]
*  And that is why it is so dangerous to them politically. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=257.52s)]
*  It was, you know, giving all that money to Lebanon at the same time when there is a problem [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=261.48s)]
*  getting more money to hurricane victims is a bad look. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=266.64s)]
*  And obviously she was angry at that question because right after she answered it, kind [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=271.6s)]
*  of she stormed out of the room. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=275.6s)]
*  Miranda, thank you very much for joining us on this very busy Wednesday. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=277.8s)]
*  Thanks, Steve. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=281.8s)]
*  You bet. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8wtCUkBZiI&t=282.8s)]
