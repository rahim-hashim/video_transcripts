# First 13 hostages set to be released as temporary Israel-Hamas cease-fire is in effect
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I)
*  Alright everybody, here we go. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=0.0s)]
*  We begin this final hour of Fox and Friends with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=1.52s)]
*  A temporary ceasefire, hence the quiet between Israel and Hamas is now underway to allow for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=4.84s)]
*  the long awaited release of civilian hostages who have been held by the terrorist group [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=10.36s)]
*  for seven weeks now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=15.76s)]
*  Thirteen hostages are expected to be freed by the terror group in about one hour from [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=17.12s)]
*  now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=21.96s)]
*  They are the first of 50 total who are set to be released over the next four days. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=22.96s)]
*  Trey Yengst is at the Israeli air base where the hostages return, where the hostage return [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=28.08s)]
*  is expected to take place. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Trey what's the update? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=35.6s)]
*  Hey guys, good morning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=36.599999999999994s)]
*  Just one hour from now the first group of hostages is expected to be released into the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=39.78s)]
*  hands of the Red Cross. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=44.72s)]
*  They will then be flown by helicopter here to the Hatzarem air base where they will receive [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=46.32s)]
*  medical attention and also be able to call their loved ones. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=51.04s)]
*  The Israelis have been bringing ambulances here today. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=54.28s)]
*  We watched that earlier. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=57.16s)]
*  They're also preparing for these small children that have been under Hamas control for nearly [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=58.64s)]
*  50 days to reintegrate into Israeli society. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=63.72s)]
*  They have toys for them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=67.6s)]
*  They have blankets and even noise canceling headphones. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=68.96s)]
*  After that they will be taken by helicopter or ambulance to one of five medical centers [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=72.06s)]
*  where they'll be hospitalized in separate secluded wards. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=76.6s)]
*  Remember the group consists of 13 people, all women and children. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=79.2s)]
*  They are reportedly from the same small community in southern Israel. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=83.0s)]
*  They are being exchanged for 24 female Palestinian prisoners and 15 male Palestinian teenagers. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=87.16s)]
*  It has been eight hours since the ceasefire went into effect with the exception of two [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=92.68s)]
*  rocket alerts about 15 minutes after the set time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=96.44s)]
*  It does appear to be holding for now. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=99.24s)]
*  The break in fighting will last for four days and if it goes well it will see 50 Israeli [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=101.2s)]
*  hostages released for 150 Palestinian prisoners. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=105.2s)]
*  Now despite the ceasefire the Israelis are calling on all residents in Gaza not to leave [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=108.92s)]
*  the south. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=113.48s)]
*  There was a group of Palestinians that tried to make their way back to the northern part [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  of the strip to see their homes and any family members left behind. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=118.92s)]
*  The Israelis have stopped them from doing so. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=122.76s)]
*  They are concerned that Hamas and Islamic Jihad will use this lull in fighting to launch [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  an ambush attack or try to put new pressure on their forces inside Gaza. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  But again the highly anticipated news today, 13 hostages expected to be released into the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  hands of the Red Cross in just about an hour from now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=139.52s)]
*  Guys? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=142.72s)]
*  If they are willing to make, if Hamas is willing to make this hostage deal that could mean [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=143.96s)]
*  that they are really hurting. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=148.96s)]
*  Do you think that the IDF is outperforming expectations here and how damaged is your [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=151.44s)]
*  assessment of Hamas? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  Look, we've been talking with senior Hamas leadership. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=157.96s)]
*  We've been talking with the Israeli military analysts since this war began on October 7th [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=162.12s)]
*  with that brutal massacre of a civilian population. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=167.36s)]
*  Hamas in no way expected this level of Israeli military response. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  In the past the Israelis have launched widespread air campaigns. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=175.88s)]
*  They've even launched incursions into the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=179.16s)]
*  But what we are seeing today is unprecedented. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  The Israelis say they will continue to fight until Hamas is completely destroyed and the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  strip is demilitarized. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=189.28s)]
*  And this will take months. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=191.0s)]
*  Israel says this is just a break in the fighting. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=192.72s)]
*  They're doing what they can through diplomatic channels negotiated by the Qataris to get [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  these hostages out. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=198.92s)]
*  But once the ceasefire is over, the Israelis will continue their efforts to destroy Hamas [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=200.72s)]
*  inside Gaza and push deeper into the strip. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  So Chad, just speaking to General Keene, he thinks about 5,000 Hamas fighters are dead, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=207.76s)]
*  but 20,000 are left. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  And they're looking for a standoff in the south. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=215.44s)]
*  He thinks they will stay and fight. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=219.04s)]
*  Have you heard that? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  And look, we have largely talked about Gaza City being the Hamas stronghold. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  Even the Israelis early in this conflict said they believed 80 percent of Hamas fighters [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=230.38s)]
*  and the majority of leadership was in Gaza City, in the tunnel network that we went to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=234.66s)]
*  this past week with Israeli forces. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=238.5s)]
*  Well, now many of those fighters and leaders have moved to the southern part of the strip. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=240.26s)]
*  They've moved to Gaza's second largest city of Khan Yunis. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=244.46s)]
*  It is a densely populated area. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=247.3s)]
*  It's an area that now has an even higher civilian population than it had before the war began. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=249.18s)]
*  And so it will be very challenging for the Israelis to operate there. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  They will face fierce battles with Hamas fighters. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=256.94s)]
*  Hamas militants still have rockets. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=260.02s)]
*  They still have RPGs and IEDs. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=261.78s)]
*  And they will continue the fight. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=263.7s)]
*  And this is really the big question. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=265.61999999999995s)]
*  What will the Israelis do? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=267.41999999999996s)]
*  Because you now have this large city inside Gaza filled with civilians and you have Hamas [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=268.82s)]
*  leadership hiding among the civilians. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=274.14s)]
*  And it creates a very challenging battlefield in the days and weeks ahead. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=276.17999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so that's an excellent point. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=279.5s)]
*  I mean, we reported for weeks Israel telling civilians to go south, go south, get away. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=280.65999999999997s)]
*  And now it looks like the fight that Israel's taking to Hamas will go right to where the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=286.1s)]
*  civilians went. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=290.02s)]
*  That's going to be very difficult. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=291.02s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of pressure on Israel to basically not go into the south probably [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=292.02s)]
*  because of that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=296.66s)]
*  But to go back to this hostage deal, it's a big if. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=297.66s)]
*  But if we go through these four days and 50 hostages are returned, there's this addendum [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=301.3s)]
*  that Israel will continue the ceasefire, 10 hostages, one day for every 10 hostages. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=305.74s)]
*  Is there another side of that where they have to release more prisoners as well? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=311.74s)]
*  Or is it after these four days, after the 150 prisoners, they just offered, hey, we'll [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=316.53999999999996s)]
*  continue the ceasefire for every 10 hostages? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=320.9s)]
*  Is there any more to that deal that would release more prisoners, also halt the surveillance, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=323.02s)]
*  the aerial surveillance, which I think is a bigger part of the story than we talked about? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=329.06s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=334.02s)]
*  We haven't gotten any information indicating the Israelis are willing to release more Palestinian [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=335.29999999999995s)]
*  prisoners as part of the deal. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=340.02s)]
*  They understand they're already getting a bad deal on paper. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=341.74s)]
*  They're not just releasing Palestinians. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=345.86s)]
*  They're releasing Palestinians that were convicted in some cases of violent crimes and attempted [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  murder. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=353.18s)]
*  And so they understand it is largely unpopular among the population, even in Israel, that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=354.18s)]
*  this is taking place. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=358.5s)]
*  But then the other side of the coin, they want to get these hostages home, these innocent [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  women and children that are going to be released in less than an hour if everything goes as [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=363.5s)]
*  planned. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=366.98s)]
*  And so the Qataris have put this into the agreement, and it's been so far from what [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=368.06s)]
*  we understand accepted by both the Israelis and Hamas that this ceasefire could be extended [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=372.18s)]
*  beyond four days. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=377.66s)]
*  And the Israelis would give the agenda items, including the lack of surveillance over Gaza [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=379.42s)]
*  and a ceasefire to Hamas in exchange for 10 hostages a day. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=385.22s)]
*  But once that is over, Israel has made very clear, especially internally to the security [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=389.78000000000003s)]
*  cabinet, that the fighting will continue. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=394.02s)]
*  They're going to do everything they can to these diplomatic channels during this lull [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FF1PuM04I&t=396.18s)]
