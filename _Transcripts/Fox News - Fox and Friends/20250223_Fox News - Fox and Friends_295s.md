# Trump highlights record first month on CPAC stage
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc)
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like this and nobody's ever seen four weeks like we've had, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=0.0s)]
*  especially the four weeks, the first four weeks. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=4.7s)]
*  You know, that's like if you golf, when you sink that first four footer in the first hole, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  it gives you confidence on the next hole, you sink another one. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=12.9s)]
*  Now you go into that third hole and you can't, and by the time you get to the fifth hole, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=15.74s)]
*  you feel you can't miss, right? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=19.68s)]
*  President Trump taking the stage at CPAC, highlighting his first month of victories, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=22.64s)]
*  including a full transparency with the press, holding multiple press conferences a week, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=26.88s)]
*  and rarely, perhaps to his detriment, refusing questions. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=31.84s)]
*  This has a new poll says nearly 70% of Americans say it's the media they don't trust to cover [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=36.4s)]
*  the president fairly and accurately. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=42.96s)]
*  And there may be a bit of wisdom behind that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  And speaking of, we welcome Fox News contributor Ben Dominich. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=47.18s)]
*  To share a little wisdom this Sunday morning, listen, I think, and you and I have had many [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=50.8s)]
*  I feel like the president is doing us all a great service, Ben, by being as transparent [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  as he has been. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=60.36s)]
*  And while I acknowledge Charlie may be right sometimes, maybe to his detriment, broadly [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=61.8s)]
*  speaking, I think it's a win for all of us. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=66.96s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=68.56s)]
*  Well, I think it's a sea change from what we saw over the last four years. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=69.56s)]
*  And good morning to you all. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=75.28s)]
*  I think that it's a welcome change, a shift away from the kind of things that were being [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=76.28s)]
*  under the Biden administration, including by the president himself and those closest around him [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=82.19999999999999s)]
*  about his own physical condition, but also about the different moves that the administration was making. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=87.0s)]
*  I think that one of the things that we need to appreciate about this moment, though, is that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=92.52s)]
*  the president is moving fast for a reason. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=96.36s)]
*  He's doing the things that he needs to do in terms of the administration, the administrative state, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  and foreign policy because he believes these things have to be leaned into in the beginning [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  of his administration. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=108.52s)]
*  He doesn't have the kind of time as someone in their second term to just wait around on a lot of this stuff. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  And so the expectation is that this first year, even this first six months, he needs to lean into [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  that momentum and use it to his political benefit. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=121.72s)]
*  I saw Pam Bondi last night on Lara Trump's new show on Saturday night, and she said it's only been a month. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  It feels like it's been two years. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=131.28s)]
*  So everybody is having to keep up to, you know, the pace of Trump. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=133.72s)]
*  Everyone in the cabinet is having to do all of this so quickly for the reasons that you say. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=138.2s)]
*  And I think it's so interesting because, Ben, I wonder if this is going to change the way every other administration. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=143.32s)]
*  I mean, it's setting the tone for every other future administration. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=150.28s)]
*  It's going to look like you're standing still if you're not moving at this pace. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=154.04s)]
*  You know, you saw that USA-Canada game where they threw the gloves down and had three [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=158.6s)]
*  fights in the first nine seconds. It's kind of like that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=163.48s)]
*  But it's actually. But one thing I will say, Rachel, for America's bureaucrats, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  it doesn't just feel like four weeks. It doesn't feel like four months. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=171.56s)]
*  It feels like a decade because the reality for them is that the reason that you see all these homes [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=174.6s)]
*  getting listed in northern Virginia and in Maryland is because people are taking those buyout deals. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=181.32s)]
*  They're getting out of this administration because they are bureaucrats who can't justify their continued existence. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=186.04s)]
*  The idea of someone having to justify their existence is not something that has existed within the federal government for a very long time. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=192.28s)]
*  What would you say you do here? And that's not something that they're used to answering. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=199.16s)]
*  And so I hope that, you know, whoever's on vacation in the Maldives this week, you know, has their data plan set up [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=203.08s)]
*  because they're going to need to send an email back to tell, you know, all the folks who are looking at what they've been doing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=208.84s)]
*  You know, what did you do during this time? Look, look, obviously, we are in the who let the doge out period of this administration. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=213.72s)]
*  And they're moving very quickly, but they're doing it for a reason. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=221.16000000000003s)]
*  And that reason is that this has been going on for far too long. Waste, fraud, abuse, the bureaucracy getting away with so many things. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=225.08s)]
*  And they want to wrap it up as quickly as possible. So we got to go. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=232.96s)]
*  But real quickly, do you foresee that this sort of whirlwind force of nature that we're seeing out of the White House is going to be enough to get Republicans on Capitol Hill [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=236.36s)]
*  to get in line and actually get some of these accomplishments through Congress that need to go through Congress? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=245.88s)]
*  Look, I think it's been a real kick in the pants for them, Charlie. And I think it's one that was long needed. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=253.16s)]
*  You know, the Congress has talked a lot about cutting, about going after these different things, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=257.48s)]
*  and they haven't been able to do it for a lot of different reasons. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=261.96s)]
*  Now, I think they actually can see that this does need to this does need to be something that is done quickly in order for it to work. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=264.6s)]
*  And I think that the level of support that he has on Capitol Hill is a complete sea change from what he had in 2017, which is a very good thing for this agenda. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=271.16s)]
*  All right, Ben Domnage, thanks for joining us this morning. Thanks so much. Good to be with you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKY8lw0C7xc&t=279.96000000000004s)]
