# Sports bring communities together, says Verizon CEO
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I)
*  And Hans Vestberg is the CEO of Verizon and he joins me now. I want to start with this though Hans, why? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=0.0s)]
*  Why is the Super Bowl, why is the NFL such an important partner for Verizon? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=5.0s)]
*  For us, we are the largest wireless provider in the United States and we have the most consumers. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=11.0s)]
*  Sport and live entertainment is really what's bringing communities together. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=17.0s)]
*  And of course, NFL is the biggest sport in the United States. That's why we have been invested in NFL for many, many years. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=22.0s)]
*  But not only by being a sponsor, but also building the technology for NFL. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=29.0s)]
*  So for us, this is both business, but also to get something to our customers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=33.0s)]
*  So this is something that everybody's looking forward to wherever you are, you're going to root for your team and all of that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=37.0s)]
*  So that's why it's so important. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=43.0s)]
*  And one of the things you're doing to help fans stay connected to this game is there's only so many people that can be here in New Orleans. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=45.0s)]
*  There's only so many people that can be in the stadium, but you've built out an experience across the country at NFL stadiums. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=50.0s)]
*  Yeah, we were thinking we came out from last year's Super Bowl. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=56.0s)]
*  We had an advertising with Beyonce that was super good and all of that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=59.0s)]
*  But we want to do something different. So we decided actually to open up 30 stadiums in the 30 NFL cities that bring our customers in to get this experience on Super Bowl. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=63.0s)]
*  Because there's so few can come here. 76,000 people coming to the stadium. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=73.0s)]
*  So we open up in every NFL city. We're open up the stadium at four o'clock and you can come in. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=77.0s)]
*  You can walk on the field, you can throw balls, you're going to have NFL legends there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=83.0s)]
*  It's going to be food. It's going to be music, local, all of it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=87.0s)]
*  So the game on the big screen game on the big screen. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=91.0s)]
*  So we have given out 150,000 tickets. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=93.0s)]
*  So it's going to be the biggest Super Bowl fan fest in the country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=96.0s)]
*  And of course, some of the cities are a little bit more exciting than others. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=101.0s)]
*  So everyone is exciting. But Kansas City, 35,000 people will come to Kansas City and 15,000 in Philadelphia. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=104.0s)]
*  And ultimately, also, we're going to have a big gathering of firefighters in SoFi Stadium in LA. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=111.0s)]
*  So we're going to monitor this, see how it works out in 30 stadiums. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=118.0s)]
*  So we're doing 30 concurrent projects in order to bring our customers and their friends an experience that you can only have when you are in a stadium and see looking at the Super Bowl. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=122.0s)]
*  So Hans, when we came into this segment, one of the things that was just said from Charlie, my friend here back on the couch in New York, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=132.0s)]
*  was the logistical challenge of keeping everybody connected. But that's not just a challenge for you in New Orleans. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=138.0s)]
*  That's not just the people who are in the stadium. You're doing this in 30 cities, keeping everyone connected. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=144.0s)]
*  No. So for us, we have worked with the NFL and of course all the all these cities over time to see that we have a super experience in all the stadiums. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=149.0s)]
*  But it's not only in the stadiums, for example, here in New Orleans. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=157.0s)]
*  We came here three years ago to see that we can take in all these fans coming. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=159.0s)]
*  So here on Bourbon Street and all around, we have built more capacity in the stadium. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=164.0s)]
*  We have super capacity. We have had that for a long time. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=168.0s)]
*  And the change we have seen is enormous of people using the phones. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=171.0s)]
*  Ten years ago, you went to a game, you were texting, sending up information. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=174.0s)]
*  Nowadays, it's going to be thousands of people streaming to their friends when they are in the stadium. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=179.0s)]
*  So you're sending up data. So you need to reverse the wireless networks so you can send up much more data. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=184.0s)]
*  Very different experience and how you build the network. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=190.0s)]
*  And you were saying that it's going to go really well. You're proud. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=193.0s)]
*  We're turning off the Wi-Fi. Our network is solid. I don't care what stadium you're in, what city you're in. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=197.0s)]
*  Absolutely. So for a Verizon customer in all the stadiums, including of course here in New Orleans, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=202.0s)]
*  we don't use the Wi-Fi because our 5G Ultra Wideband is superior, giving you a much better downlink and uplink. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=207.0s)]
*  So we are doing that and we feel really confident about that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=213.0s)]
*  So there you go. FaceTime your friend during the game? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=217.0s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=219.0s)]
*  No problem? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=220.0s)]
*  Yeah, no problem. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=221.0s)]
*  So, Ron Zvesberg, CEO of Verizon, thank you so much. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=222.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=224.0s)]
*  Good to meet you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDxVWLa9v_I&t=225.0s)]
