# 'FULL DANCE CARD': Countries line up for tariff meetings with Trump officials
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70)
*  Alright now to a Fox News alert trade extensions or tensions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=0.0s)]
*  I should say trade tensions escalating overnight as Beijing announces a 125 percent tariff on US imports [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=3.72s)]
*  That's up from 84 percent after the White House says tariffs on China are now at 145 percent [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=10.68s)]
*  So meanwhile President Trump says he's very close to his first deal [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=16.52s)]
*  If you aren't able to reach the deals that you want to see at the end of the 90 days [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=21.48s)]
*  Will you put those higher tariffs in place or will you accept? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=25.74s)]
*  Well that's what would happen. I mean if we can't make the deal that we [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=29.099999999999998s)]
*  Want to make or we have to make or that's you know good for both parties [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=32.699999999999996s)]
*  It's got to be good for both parties and then we go back to where we were [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=36.64s)]
*  Go back to the numbers that you announced last I think so wouldn't extend the pause. Yeah [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=40.62s)]
*  We'll have to see what happens. Well here to explain what those next 90 days will be like is US Trade Representative Jameson Greer [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=45.5s)]
*  Jameson first off your take on what we woke up to today [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=52.96s)]
*  Upping the retaliatory tariffs on America to over a hundred percent your reaction [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=56.6s)]
*  Well, good morning. I would say that the Chinese reaction this morning is is not terribly surprising, but certainly unfortunate [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=63.28s)]
*  No one else has retaliated against these reciprocal tariffs yet [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=70.76s)]
*  China got out ahead and decided to do it and and that's why they're in a different category than the rest of this point [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=74.48s)]
*  Jameson I know you've already talked to some countries and you're planning on talking to some today. Can you tell our audience which ones? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=79.88s)]
*  Certainly in fact right after I'm done with this TV spot. I'm going to be speaking with my counterpart in Israel [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  Lat over the last two days. I had a long discussion with the Vietnamese [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  We're speaking with the Taiwanese later today as well. I have a full dance card [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=95.16s)]
*  Yeah, so I guess representative a lot of questions the big question on Americans mind [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=99.32s)]
*  They're on board when it comes to knowing that China is a threat and they steal a lot of stuff from us [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  Is there a plan to make up the difference for some of those businesses that are going to be hit hard? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=111.36s)]
*  by this trade war [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=117.0s)]
*  Well, certainly and part of the reason we're doing negotiations is to achieve [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=119.8s)]
*  More fair and balanced and reciprocal trade with other nations and part of this means opening up their export markets as we all know [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=124.28s)]
*  There have been so many barriers to US products and foreign and foreign markets for many years whether it's tariffs or non-tariff barriers [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=132.22s)]
*  Or other things like that. And so as we're meeting with these countries every day [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=139.58s)]
*  We're talking about ways where we can have more US exports and give and give our producers alternative markets to China in addition to China [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  All right. So when we look at China, tell me if these numbers line up with your numbers [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=151.18s)]
*  We get 73% of our smartphones 78% of our laptops [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=155.62s)]
*  87% of our video game consoles 77% of our toys are from China if those numbers are correct [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=159.94s)]
*  Well, what do you the marketplace is going to get severely hit by these tariffs? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=167.78s)]
*  So I understand that we do import a lot from China and that actually to me underscores the urgency of the situation [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=174.82s)]
*  We've become so dependent on this that being said many of our large companies dealing in hardware and consumer electronics [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=182.12s)]
*  Have been diversifying over the past few years to Vietnam to India to Mexico to Korea to elsewhere [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=189.1s)]
*  And those are the kind of trends we need to see to help diversify that production [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=194.7s)]
*  So that can help out American consumers and American companies, but but in the meantime they say it's gonna cost the American household [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=199.1s)]
*  $4,800 what do you say to those households? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  What first of all I would say with respect to those projections a lot of those are Wall Street analysts who have a lot to lose [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  Themselves in the first term we put a lot of tariffs on China and we saw similar predictions those ended up being wrong [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  inflation went down [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=221.89999999999998s)]
*  You know, I think the economic fundamentals of our of our of our country are still very very good [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=223.42s)]
*  And while there may be an adjustment [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=228.54s)]
*  I think we're gonna be on a good path and I don't think we're gonna see that level of increase in household expenses [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=230.26s)]
*  Yeah, I know a lot of countries are still at 10% [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=235.45999999999998s)]
*  So many of those products maybe we can buy from other countries. What are the next 90 days look like? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  Sure, I'm happy to give you some detail on this. So my my office the office of the US Trade Representative [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  I have hundreds of people [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=249.0s)]
*  They're split up according to regional areas and they're working around the clock with their counterparts at the staff level [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=250.56s)]
*  And there's there are pieces of paper going back and forth as countries come in and make suggestions about what they can do [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=256.8s)]
*  To have more reciprocal trade with China. Sorry with us and we're looking at those. We're reviewing those [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=262.44s)]
*  We're communicating with them and giving them ideas so we can get to a point where the president can can close these deals [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=268.36s)]
*  He can negotiate and if there's a deal that's good [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=274.38s)]
*  You can consider taking it and if and if not, then he'll have the tariff, but that's what we're doing over the next 90 days [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=276.52s)]
*  We've been doing it for weeks and we're doing it today. We'll just keep doing it. Mr. Representative [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=282.04s)]
*  The president has said keep calm [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=286.0s)]
*  Don't get yippee. You seem like a calm guy yourself [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=289.32s)]
*  But what do you tell the American people that are on your side? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=292.92s)]
*  On the president's side, but they are a little scared because they they see [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=296.36s)]
*  Everything in their house and they look at the label and it says made in China [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=300.72s)]
*  Yes, I you know, there's a story from a couple years ago one of my kids [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=305.68s)]
*  One day looked at me said dad. Why does everything say made in China? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=310.32s)]
*  They must be so busy over there and they're exactly right. But again, you know, this has been a bipartisan approach for the past [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=313.32s)]
*  Almost eight years at this point that we need to diversify from China and be able to source from other countries [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=321.24s)]
*  And so I am obviously sensitive to the needs of households and what we're seeing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=326.98s)]
*  but but we've been put in a position and in a point of emergency frankly where if we can only [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  Maintain our standard of living by being dependent on China who is a strategic adversary [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  That's a very dangerous position to be in and so and so we need to accelerate this [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=341.72s)]
*  What did you learn from the phase one deal last time which they didn't keep to and it wasn't enforced does that make you [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  Worry about cutting any deal with China in the long run [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=352.16s)]
*  Well, my sense is that the Chinese are pragmatic. I learned to have a deep respect for them. They're very serious [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=355.68s)]
*  They understand power and realpolitik in the international arena [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=361.76000000000005s)]
*  When we did the phase one deal in the first couple of years where the Trump administration was still there [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  We actually were able to enforce it they bought more ag products from us in in 2020 and then even the 2021 then they had [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=372.68s)]
*  Done in history. So it is a matter of enforcement [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=379.12s)]
*  And I think if there's mutual understanding mutual respect and a real agreement you can actually move the ball forward [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=381.84s)]
*  Okay. Thank you so much for coming on this morning. You've had a busy week, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=388.28s)]
*  Just like exit question. Can you get 70 deals done in 90 days? I [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=393.44s)]
*  Think we can get enough deals done to the president so he can be comfortable that we're moving the ball forward making trade more reciprocal [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=398.12s)]
*  And pushing forward American prosperity, okay. Thank you. Thanks for [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=404.08s)]
*  China escalating the ongoing trade war with the US [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=408.72s)]
*  overnight Beijing announcing a [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  125% tariff on US imports. This is up from [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=415.56s)]
*  84% duty that China announced on Wednesday. So this has the White House clarified yesterday that the 20% [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=419.52s)]
*  Fentanyl tear will remain in effect bringing the total tear of on China to 145 [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=426.68s)]
*  Yeah, we did some bad math early [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=432.2s)]
*  But now that's just the total China's Finance Ministry responding saying quote [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=433.92s)]
*  Even if the US continues to impose higher tariffs [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=437.94s)]
*  It will no longer make economic sense and will become a joke in the history of world economy [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=440.48s)]
*  All right, President Xi also saying today his country is not afraid their new [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=446.14s)]
*  125% tariff rate on US goods kicks in tomorrow and here we go [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=451.12s)]
*  So no one's backing off know what but the thing that obviously it's it's gonna affect us got it [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=455.92s)]
*  But when you realize how much China is hurting internally their marketing their housing market has collapsed [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=462.32s)]
*  The stimulus money that they put in has not been affected [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=469.44s)]
*  They have a youth unemployment rate where kids are growing from college and they just don't want to work not [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=472.68s)]
*  Opportunities available to the point where they're going back to the colleges saying if your students your graduates don't get jobs [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=477.96000000000004s)]
*  We're coming after you that's how desperate they are and most of what they need now since they put their great at producing things [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=483.84s)]
*  But would they need us to consume their things and if this if the price has become too high [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=490.11999999999995s)]
*  America naturally will start giving the Heisman to Chinese goods [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=496.32s)]
*  I think this has become the national security issue of our time as well Brian. They hack us like crazy [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=499.76s)]
*  They steal like crazy [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=505.96s)]
*  They knock off our products all the time and you really can't compete at the end of the day with slave labor [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=507.23999999999995s)]
*  We outlawed in this country for a reason and now we essentially buy the products from a different country that does the same thing, right? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=513.76s)]
*  We get a lot of computers a lot of phones a lot of toys from China, but the president says this is he's optimistic [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=520.8399999999999s)]
*  This was good news. He said we're very close to doing one of these trade deals. Listen [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=526.54s)]
*  Well, I think it's very close but you know, we have to have a deal that we like [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=539.4799999999999s)]
*  We don't want a deal that's gonna be a bad deal or I could I could make every deal in one day if I wanted to [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppEozb_Wy70&t=542.6s)]
