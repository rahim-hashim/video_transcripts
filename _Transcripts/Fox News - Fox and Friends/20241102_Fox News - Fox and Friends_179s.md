# Trump shares troubling assessment of the ‘worst’ jobs report he has ever seen
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg)
*  We just talked to you about fake news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=0.0s)]
*  Then there's also fake jobs reports. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=2.24s)]
*  We talked about this with Donald Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=4.18s)]
*  So the October jobs numbers came in. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  12,000 jobs added in October. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Way below expectations. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=11.02s)]
*  I think to me the more important, and mostly government jobs too by the way, is the revision [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=12.94s)]
*  of September and August numbers. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=18.02s)]
*  And this is happening over and over and over. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=20.84s)]
*  Like I think it's nine out of the last 12 months they put out a jobs report. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Oh, look at the economists doing well. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  And then a month or two passes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=27.22s)]
*  They go, we're going to go ahead and revise those job numbers down from a month or two [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=28.54s)]
*  ago. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=31.619999999999997s)]
*  And of course, that's like a correction in a newspaper. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=32.62s)]
*  Nobody sees it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=34.14s)]
*  It's on the bottom of page two. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=35.14s)]
*  So we asked Donald Trump about these new job numbers. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=37.1s)]
*  They came up with the worst jobs report. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=42.0s)]
*  You know, I would say in history almost. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=44.46s)]
*  But it goes back many years where 12,000 jobs. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=46.94s)]
*  That's like for a little piece of a company. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=51.9s)]
*  12,000 jobs were created. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=55.58s)]
*  100,000 manufacturing jobs were lost. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=57.74s)]
*  150,000 jobs were lost. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=61.220000000000006s)]
*  It's the worst. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=63.78s)]
*  It's a depression type statement. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=64.78s)]
*  It was the worst statement I've seen in decades. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=66.86s)]
*  Just before the election. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=70.7s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=71.9s)]
*  They created, through fraud, they created 818,000 fake jobs. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=72.9s)]
*  It had to be taken off the books. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=80.38s)]
*  And they wanted to do that, but they wanted to be able to quietly take it off the books [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=82.54s)]
*  after the election. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  Think of that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=87.62s)]
*  They created 818,000 fake jobs to make the numbers look better. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=88.62s)]
*  And a whistleblower blew the whistle and said they were a fraud. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=96.22s)]
*  And then they, as you saw last night, if you saw my speech, they created another 112,000 [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=101.14s)]
*  fake jobs last month. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  So almost a million fake jobs so that they look better. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=108.10000000000001s)]
*  And they were going to announce that they were fake. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=111.94s)]
*  They wouldn't announce it that way. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=114.46000000000001s)]
*  They would do it where they're taking back and they were going to take those jobs back [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=116.02s)]
*  after the election, announce it after. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=120.02s)]
*  But they didn't get through the election because a whistleblower blew the whistle. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=122.34s)]
*  You guys listen, Donald Trump ended his campaign yesterday talking about economics. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=125.86s)]
*  That is what he wants to talk about. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=133.7s)]
*  By the way, this is what he said. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=134.7s)]
*  This is not talking about the election. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=135.7s)]
*  This is not a chariot event. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=137.42s)]
*  This is an election for the biggest and toughest job in human history. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=138.96s)]
*  you want to trust your house, your savings, your pension to Kamala, who has the economic [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=143.7s)]
*  understanding of a child. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=150.61999999999998s)]
*  And I think that's the message he's saying. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=152.5s)]
*  That's unfair to children. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=153.89999999999998s)]
*  I agree. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=154.89999999999998s)]
*  Sorry, guys. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=155.89999999999998s)]
*  Sorry, guys. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=156.89999999999998s)]
*  But here's the deal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  This is really what people care about. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=160.42s)]
*  And so the media can talk about, you know, all the hoaxes and lies that they're talking [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=161.89999999999998s)]
*  about, but people are thinking about their pocketbook right now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NGpgbTkrPg&t=165.98s)]
