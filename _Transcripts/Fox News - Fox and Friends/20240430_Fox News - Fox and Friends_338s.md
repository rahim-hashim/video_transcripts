# George Washington statue draped in Palestinian flag on DC campus
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI)
*  As we move from New York City, our nation's capital is seeing similar protests. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=0.0s)]
*  Griff Jenkins is live on the campus of George Washington University with details. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=5.16s)]
*  And Griff, on Saturday night, we walked through a great big demonstration. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we sure did, Steve. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  And here at GW, they're in their sixth day of protest. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=17.44s)]
*  Yesterday was the last day of classes, but the protests certainly continue. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  I want to show you, you got about 70 tents set up here of protesters. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=24.84s)]
*  And they're not just GW students. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=29.68s)]
*  You've also got students from other schools like Georgetown American. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=31.04s)]
*  And you've got professional activists out here as well. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  It's peaceful right now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=38.4s)]
*  Sunday night, though, there were barricades along where that sidewalk is. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=39.76s)]
*  They broke those down. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=44.32s)]
*  There were clashes with police. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=45.56s)]
*  There's a strong police presence. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=47.4s)]
*  I can show you if you just look this way, the police have blocked off this street [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=48.8s)]
*  here and all the profanity. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=53.16s)]
*  But Steve, let me show you what goes right to the core of what really hurts [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=54.64s)]
*  the passions of the Jewish students. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=59.88s)]
*  And that is the here long live the Intifada. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=62.52s)]
*  There is only one solution. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=66.04s)]
*  Intifada revolution here from the river to the sea. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=67.6s)]
*  These are the chance that the Jewish students say is anti-Semitism. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=71.72s)]
*  And it is everywhere here as we walk here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=76.92s)]
*  Come with me this way. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=79.8s)]
*  We'll we'll take you over here and give you a little look into the encampment, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=80.56s)]
*  a little closer, because there's one thing I wanted to show you, Steve, and that is [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=84.36s)]
*  the signature statue here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  George Washington himself has been draped in a Palestine flag and also the kaffir, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  which is a traditional headdress, a black and white headdress that's worn by Palestinians. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=96.91999999999999s)]
*  And that, of course, has become quite a symbol of the situation here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  We can show you and get a look there right in the center of campus. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=105.28s)]
*  This is University Yard. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=108.6s)]
*  This is where they originally took him over. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=109.83999999999999s)]
*  And you can see up here, this is George Washington, the statue here, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=112.52s)]
*  graffiti covered in stickers. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=117.44s)]
*  And this is what really hurts the Jewish students as well to see a scene like this right now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=120.24s)]
*  But as we say, it's peaceful right now. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  Quite different. The scene, by the way, about 90 minutes south of us in Richmond, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=129.2s)]
*  in Virginia Commonwealth University, they set up an encampment and began clashing [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=133.76s)]
*  last night with the rest. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=137.92s)]
*  They were throwing the protesters throwing bottles at police. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=139.24s)]
*  But we haven't seen that here, fortunately, as we sit here, literally just blocks from the White House. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=142.12s)]
*  Steve, so just real quick, can you just tell me what what the deal is? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=148.04s)]
*  Are they under a deadline to move out? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=152.4s)]
*  Does any of the school administration anywhere? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=154.72s)]
*  Do they have anything to say? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=156.96s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=162.0s)]
*  And actually, I just spoke with a school official about five minutes ago, said, is there going to be any [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=163.52s)]
*  deadline, kind of like we saw in Colombia? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  They said right now there's no deadline to move the students, although a few days ago, when I was out here on [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=170.6s)]
*  Friday, the school did make students aware, put them on notice that some could be suspended if they don't leave. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=176.8s)]
*  But you don't see that. And clearly, the students don't have any plans to leave right now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=182.84s)]
*  She's covering her head because they don't they don't talk to the media. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=187.56s)]
*  So we don't bother them. But as we cover it, it's a peaceful situation right now. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=190.32s)]
*  No plans to leave. Are there people? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=194.4s)]
*  Yes, there's people here in all of these tents. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=196.32s)]
*  We. There are people in the tents, yeah, Ainsley, and we believe there's about 70 of them here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=198.72s)]
*  You can see this one, a medical tent set up. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=205.52s)]
*  They're kind of policing themselves since they set up six days ago and they have the same demands we're seeing at the other [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  campuses. They want the divestiture from any company that has anything to do with Israel and they want amnesty as well [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  for any students who may be facing suspension, expulsion or any arrests, which we haven't seen here yet. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=220.96s)]
*  That's right. And that's true. You started on Griff. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  Jonathan Turley told us because his office is right there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=230.96s)]
*  The cops have essentially given it over to the protesters. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=233.88000000000002s)]
*  I know you said the protesters don't want to be on camera, but we saw some of them there. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=237.08s)]
*  The question I would ask them off camera or on camera is, OK, so you're you're being peaceful here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  What do you make of these protesters who took over a building at Columbia University where they they you know, they took it over. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=247.72000000000003s)]
*  They barricaded themselves in and they're not coming out until they their demands are met. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=255.28s)]
*  Well, that's a great question. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=264.0s)]
*  I can. Could you could you just give us a thought of how your peaceful protest here's remain peaceful and your thoughts about what [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=265.56s)]
*  you're seeing at the other campuses where it's become violent. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=271.76s)]
*  Do you have thoughts on that at all? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  News station you're from and with Fox News Channel. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=277.24s)]
*  We're live right now. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=280.0s)]
*  I can find someone for you to talk to. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=282.2s)]
*  OK, I think it's never first coffee to us here is hard to get coffee through the mask, I guess. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=286.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=292.48s)]
*  Well, Griff, I guess so. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=294.12s)]
*  And you know, this this, by the way, this is the lasting shot. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  I want to leave you with this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=299.12s)]
*  This is the shot that's going to be the one for the history books of the protests here. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=300.12s)]
*  And you can see, by the way, let me show you one more thing if I can. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=305.40000000000003s)]
*  And that is do you see these barricades? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=308.48s)]
*  This is when it got the most heated on Sunday. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=310.52s)]
*  Those barricades were along the sidewalk we just crossed, but they knocked them down and piled them up here. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=314.08s)]
*  And now they're in the center of campus. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=321.24s)]
*  Parents must be so proud. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=324.28s)]
*  All right. Great. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=325.8s)]
*  I think that's the most expensive school in the country, by the way. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=327.24s)]
*  I think it's something like ninety three thousand dollars a year. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=329.6s)]
*  Well, I stand by. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=332.4s)]
*  Apparently they're going to get somebody for you to talk to and you can relate. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=334.32s)]
*  They're coming. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNechg4MqXI&t=337.8s)]
