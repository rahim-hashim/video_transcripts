# Trump sees STUNNING gains with Black male voters in key swing state
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4)
*  If you're just waking up at 6 42, look at the number right there. Trump won. Meanwhile, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=0.0s)]
*  swing state Georgia turning red once again and Donald Trump's big win means there's a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=12.36s)]
*  big reason he's going to soon be heading back to the White House. And Dana Marie McNichol [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=17.8s)]
*  joins us live from Atlanta. Hey Dana Marie. Good morning guys. Well this of course was [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  a very hard fought battle in the state of Georgia. Last night the state was called around [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=29.46s)]
*  12 48 just after midnight as we watched both candidates for so many resources into the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=33.58s)]
*  state up into the very end. Senator J. D. Vance spent election night eve in Atlanta [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=40.38s)]
*  holding a rally. So it seems like all those efforts really paid off. Let's dive into some [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=45.66s)]
*  of those numbers. Of course we knew this was going to be a very tight race. The two candidates [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=49.94s)]
*  were separated by just over 117,000 votes. Trump took the lead by 2.4 votes. Now Georgia doesn't [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=54.78s)]
*  require an automatic recount of results under state law, but a candidate can request a recount [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=63.42s)]
*  if the margin of error is within 0.5 percentage points. Of course that's not the case this year, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=69.02s)]
*  but with that being said, if Harris petitions the secretary of state regarding a suspected [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=74.1s)]
*  error or discrepancy, the secretary of state can ask for a recount. Now of course this was a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=79.18s)]
*  redemption for the former president after losing to President Biden in 2020 by such a slim margin [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=85.18s)]
*  of just 0.2 percent, which is only 11,779 votes to be exact. Now although when we go back to the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=91.34s)]
*  2016 election, former President Trump won the state by five points. Now the candidates battled [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=100.62s)]
*  over gaining the support from black voters, but specifically black male voters. Fox News voter [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=107.5s)]
*  analysis shows Trump doubled his support with black men this election with 24 percent compared [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=113.74000000000001s)]
*  to the 11 percent in 2020, a key to winning this state, especially here in Georgia. Him over [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=120.38s)]
*  performing in urban and rural areas really gave him what he needed, guys, to get back to the White [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=126.78s)]
*  House. Thank you very much, Dana-Marie, live in Atlanta. Wow, you know, it's amazing how many [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=132.78s)]
*  demographics that he improved on. I don't think he lost in any demographic, and I don't think Harris, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=137.9s)]
*  the way we started half hour ago, there was not one area, one district, one county where Harris [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=142.46s)]
*  improved on Joe Biden. You're right. Think about that. This is beyond me right here, and you can [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=148.06s)]
*  call it what you want to call it, but they made the case that the country is racist, right? Joe [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=154.46s)]
*  Biden got more of the black vote than Kamala Harris. I mean, you just can't demonize everybody. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=160.78s)]
*  We almost got one-fourth of the black men, 24 percent. Because high prices impact everybody, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=167.98s)]
*  and 70 percent of the country said we're on the wrong track. That's what really helped them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=174.46s)]
*  Black men don't want to hand out. They want to work hard and provide for their families. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=178.94s)]
*  Listen, we love working hard. Yeah. And we're hungry. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDaznlFHUS4&t=182.46s)]
