# 'Hell to pay': Trump's BOLD warning welcomed by hostages' families
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o)
*  At least 11 people are dead following Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the first deadly strike on either country since the ceasefire went into effect last [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=5.32s)]
*  week. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=9.52s)]
*  Now both sides are accusing each other of violating the agreement. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=10.52s)]
*  The IDF says the strike was in response to a pair of Hezbollah rockets hitting northern [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=13.24s)]
*  Israel after Hezbollah also accused Israel of violating the ceasefire. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=18.68s)]
*  The IDF says it was targeting Hezbollah terrorists and their infrastructure. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Here at home, Americans rally to demand hostages held by Hamas be released immediately. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=27.4s)]
*  Among the rallygoers in New York City was the family of Adan Alexander. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=42.6s)]
*  Just one day before the rally, Adan appeared in a Hamas propaganda video begging Benjamin [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  Netanyahu and President-elect Trump to agree to a deal. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=52.92s)]
*  Adi Alexander is Adan's father and he joins me now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=57.040000000000006s)]
*  Sir thank you so much for being here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=60.52s)]
*  What went through your mind when you saw your son in that video? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=62.52s)]
*  First of all it was very emotional and very disturbing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=66.0s)]
*  It was our first sign of life, the actual sign of life. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=69.64s)]
*  Other people saw him in the tunnels back in November of the last year but we never saw [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  him and that was the first time when we saw our son begging for his life. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=79.44s)]
*  So it has to be bittersweet knowing that your son is alive but also knowing the conditions [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=86.8s)]
*  that he is in and has been in for 14 months. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=94.64s)]
*  It's simply unbelievable the unhumane condition that those hostages are being kept. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=99.6s)]
*  It's simply unbelievable with no Red Cross access. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  We don't know if they get enough nutrition, enough food, medicine. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=111.36s)]
*  We don't know nothing and it's very disturbing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=116.36s)]
*  It's disturbing for all of us to watch this and learn about the plight of the hostages [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=120.72s)]
*  but I cannot imagine going through that as a parent. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=126.48s)]
*  Can you even put into words the emotions that you go through as a parent? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=131.04s)]
*  Our son in this video, at the last segment of this video, asked us to stay strong and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=136.32s)]
*  he told us that he hopes that this nightmare will be ending soon. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=144.44s)]
*  So we have to go on autopilot every morning, just go into this mode and just keep fighting [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=147.88s)]
*  for his release. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=154.8s)]
*  There is no other choice and the hope is mandatory. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=155.8s)]
*  What has been your latest communication with Benjamin Netanyahu and President Biden? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=159.04s)]
*  So Benjamin Netanyahu called my wife a couple of days ago saying that the deal, there is [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=165.66s)]
*  a deal on the table and they are working tirelessly to narrow the gaps with Hamas and pass it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=172.4s)]
*  over the finish line. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=180.72s)]
*  And I had a similar conversation with the White House. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=183.28s)]
*  We have an understanding that the reason, the reason deal that every part have to make [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  some concession to narrow those gaps and we hope that the diplomacy will work this time. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=194.92s)]
*  Does the election of Donald Trump change anything in your mind? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=202.2s)]
*  Yes, I think so. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  That was a hell of a tweet to start with from yesterday and I met with President Trump a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  couple of months ago. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=213.88s)]
*  He looked disturbed. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=215.76s)]
*  This issue is very close to his heart. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=217.48s)]
*  He feels for the hostages and I don't think he want this conflict on his plate on January [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=220.04s)]
*  20th and he want to finish the war. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=227.04s)]
*  So you think your son is going to be released before inauguration day? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=230.76s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=235.0s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  I really hope so. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=236.28s)]
*  And if he's not, do you trust Donald J. Trump will bring your son home? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=243.32s)]
*  We need a strong leadership. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=244.92s)]
*  We need the use of the friendship between both leaders, Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=248.32s)]
*  Trump to execute the deal and to make unnecessary concessions. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  What's your message to the Biden administration? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=260.76000000000005s)]
*  To Biden, we have a great amount of access on the highest level with the Biden administration. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=263.68s)]
*  My message, please use the remaining time that you have in the White House to execute [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  this deal and don't forget our kids. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=277.88000000000005s)]
*  Final question. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=283.16s)]
*  Your wife is overseas right now in Tel Aviv. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=284.48s)]
*  You have a family that has been going through this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=286.68s)]
*  It's not just you. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=289.12s)]
*  What's the family doing? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=290.16s)]
*  The family, we are strong for the past almost 14 months. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=291.16s)]
*  We have an 18-year-old daughter. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=297.64s)]
*  She's in college. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=300.56s)]
*  We have another kid, 13 years old, which is a great basketball player. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=302.04s)]
*  My wife, she's strong. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=306.32s)]
*  We are strong and we'll keep fighting. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=308.08s)]
*  Again, these segments hit different when it's parent to parent. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=311.16s)]
*  I cannot imagine what you were going through, but just know that you are in all of our prayers [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=314.68s)]
*  and I know you're in the current administration and in the future administrations, thoughts [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=320.12s)]
*  and prayers as well. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  They will bring your son home, hopefully, and that is what we pray for every day. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=326.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Israel, family members of hostages desperately waiting for answers, including [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=330.52s)]
*  our next guest, Etai Chen's father, Ruby Chen, joins us now. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=334.8s)]
*  Ms. Chen, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=339.6s)]
*  Ruby, I appreciate it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=342.28s)]
*  Your thoughts right now that there's a ceasefire with Hezbollah. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=344.04s)]
*  It's also mysteriously quiet with Iran. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=347.88s)]
*  Now there's going to be more focus, I imagine, on Gaza, where your son is thought to be held. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=351.4s)]
*  What are your thoughts now? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=357.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think we want to first thank the president. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=358.56s)]
*  He has not been that much on social and the fact that he tweeted what he did yesterday [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  just shows his commitment to this topic. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=370.44s)]
*  We cherish his obligation to our cause, the tragedy that we've been having to endure for [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=374.76000000000005s)]
*  over 424 days. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  And I just want to pause a second and also send our condolences, my family's condolences, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=385.56s)]
*  to the Neutra family that received tragic news yesterday after 423 days that they had [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=390.16s)]
*  hope that their son was still alive, they were notified. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  I think it's also coupled with the sign of life that Idan Alexander, the Alexander family, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=402.24s)]
*  the kid from New Jersey, we got on Saturday. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=409.0s)]
*  I think those two events, you kind of couple them together. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=412.35999999999996s)]
*  I think A, brought the president to talk about the topic on social and B, I know that it [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=415.47999999999996s)]
*  also connected and incentivized both teams, the existing administration as well as the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=422.44s)]
*  incoming administration to work together in a bipartisan way as how to find a solution [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=431.04s)]
*  for this tragedy before January 20th happens. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=436.76000000000005s)]
*  It's just important about President of the United States saying definitively, hey, you [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=439.44s)]
*  got six Americans there, they're dual citizens, most of them, we want them out and you better [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=442.96000000000004s)]
*  fix this by the time I get there. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=448.68s)]
*  And that's the type of directness you need from the President of the United States. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=451.16s)]
*  It seems to be very welcome among the hostage families. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=454.72s)]
*  I also know that Hamas watches and understands the world press, watches the news. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=459.15999999999997s)]
*  What should they take away from that? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=465.96s)]
*  It's exactly the type of language we were missing. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=468.64s)]
*  It's seven US hostages. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=471.08s)]
*  And I think the message was not just directed to Hamas, I think it was also directed to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=473.0s)]
*  ILAN and the other beneficiaries that have been supporting Hamas financially. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=479.0s)]
*  I could say for a fact, Hamas is still able to pay monthly salaries to its militants as [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=485.24s)]
*  well as its operators inside of Gaza. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=493.56s)]
*  It is unacceptable that Hamas is able to pay tens of millions of dollars monthly to these [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  people. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=502.56s)]
*  The money is coming from places that we know, places in the Middle East, people or countries [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=503.4s)]
*  that claim to be allies of the United States, NATO countries. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  And that needs to stop. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=513.5999999999999s)]
*  And I think that is going to be a very strong message from the President once he gets into [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUtKtugsz3o&t=515.3199999999999s)]
