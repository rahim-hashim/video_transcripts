# IDF confirms another top-ranking Hezbollah commander has been killed
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY)
*  We're back with the Fox News alert. Overnight, the IDF confirming it has taken out another [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=0.0s)]
*  senior Hezbollah terrorist on the U.S. wanted list, seen as a likely successor to slain [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=5.92s)]
*  leader Hassan Nasrallah. So they took out Nasrallah and then they took out the guy that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  replaced him right away. But as Israel continues to dismantle Iran-backed Hezbollah, Joe Biden [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  still pushing for a truce. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=21.18s)]
*  Mr. President, is it a ground incursion into Lebanon inevitable? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=23.68s)]
*  My first ceasefire. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=28.68s)]
*  Will you respond to the missile attacks on U.S. warships in the Red Sea? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=30.68s)]
*  We're responding. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=35.68s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about fighting against Islamists, and that's former U.S. Army Green [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=39.68s)]
*  Beret Lieutenant Colonel Scott Mann joins us now. Colonel, thanks for being here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=44.68s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Pete. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=48.68s)]
*  It doesn't feel like those shouted answers inspire much confidence, and we're hearing [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=49.68s)]
*  reports that Israel didn't let the White House know previously about this strike, because [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=54.68s)]
*  they were worried that the White House would say, don't do it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=59.68s)]
*  Yeah, and if that is the case, I mean, that's extremely telling. It's like we need to step [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=61.68s)]
*  back and take a collective look in the mirror if Israel withheld that information from us, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=65.68s)]
*  because they were afraid we would actually intervene with the attack. That's troubling. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=69.68s)]
*  But would it surprise you? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=74.68s)]
*  Right now, no. I mean, I think one of the things that I'm concerned about is it almost [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=76.68s)]
*  seems like since the fall of Kabul, we have really been challenged with how we show up [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=80.68s)]
*  as an ally against international terrorism. You know, the countries that we should be [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=85.68s)]
*  at their shoulder, and we've historically been at their shoulder, all of a sudden now [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=89.68s)]
*  we're not, and it's to the point that they don't even trust us enough as a partner to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=93.68s)]
*  be at their shoulder in the moment of truth, so they just leave us out of the equation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=98.68s)]
*  Exactly. So what do local—you work so often with local allies. That's what you did as a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=101.68s)]
*  green beret. When they sense that America is saying, hey, that's not our fight anymore, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=105.68s)]
*  for whatever reason, what's their reaction? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=109.68s)]
*  Well, I mean, what you've seen here is where they'll just go it alone, you know, and to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=113.68s)]
*  scream for a ceasefire after the horrorism of October 7 and what they went through, I don't [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=117.68s)]
*  think that's what we would do, right? And so to expect them to do that is just—it's beyond [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=122.68s)]
*  the pale, and it's just not realistic. And whether you're working with a village in [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=126.68s)]
*  Afghanistan or you're working with an international partner that's a nation state, how you show [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=130.68s)]
*  up in the moment of truth determines how they show up for you. And that's what I'm most [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=134.68s)]
*  concerned about because we're just as much in the crosshairs as Israel is. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=138.68s)]
*  Absolutely. Okay, you've been so good to us on this program for so long. I want to take a [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=142.68s)]
*  moment to promote your new book. Comes out on Tuesday. It's called Nobody Is Coming To [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=146.68s)]
*  Save You, subtitled A Green Beret's Guide to Getting Big Stuff Done. Tell us about it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=150.68s)]
*  Yeah, so I wrote the book. As a young green beret I learned early on, a lot of good senior [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=156.68s)]
*  sergeants taught me that, hey, in these rough, trust-depleted places of churn in Afghanistan, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=160.68s)]
*  nobody's coming to save you. Whatever you've got's what you've got. And the way that we [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=164.68s)]
*  survived and thrived was based on the relationships we built when trust was low. And it was, you [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=168.68s)]
*  know, old school interpersonal skills. And I think that's what we need in the country today. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=173.68s)]
*  If you look at the country, no matter who wins the election, Pete, we're going to come out of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=177.68s)]
*  this thing more divided than what we went in. And that really exposes us as a nation. And I [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=181.68s)]
*  think leaders are going to have to still connect with clients. They're still going to have to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=186.68s)]
*  have those uncomfortable Thanksgiving conversations. And this book is the old school [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=190.68s)]
*  interpersonal skills that green berets and other special operators use in low-trust environments [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=194.68s)]
*  to build rapport and build relationships. Interesting. Low-trust environment is exactly [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=199.68s)]
*  what we're walking into. You mentioned it, and that was the page I was drawn to, the churn. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=203.68s)]
*  Just explain that real quick. Yeah, I think we live in an unprecedented time of distraction, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=207.68s)]
*  disengagement, and division in the country. It's just unprecedented. And we're practicing like a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=211.68s)]
*  form of shadow tribalism with each other. And we're actually going against what this country was [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=216.68s)]
*  founded on. And if we don't figure this out pretty soon, I mean, it could end in societal collapse. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=220.68s)]
*  The churn is the enemy. The Republican or the Democrat across from you, no matter how this [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=225.68s)]
*  election sorts out, that's not the enemy. The enemy is this unprecedented social condition that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=230.68s)]
*  we're dealing with. And that book will help people navigate those conditions and make better [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=235.68s)]
*  connections. The book is Nobody is Coming to Save You. You sent this to me. I got it inscribed. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=239.68s)]
*  Thank you very much. Yes, sir. If you want to get things done in difficult and distracted times, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=244.68s)]
*  here's the guide for you. Colonel Scott Mann, thank you so much. Thank you, Pete. God bless you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0UrIdyL3FY&t=248.68s)]
