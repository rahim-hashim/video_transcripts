# Bodycam footage appears to show Dem 'body-slamming' ICE agents, storming facility
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0)
*  So body camera footage showing things getting physical when Democrats stormed a New Jersey [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=0.0s)]
*  ICE facility. Those lawmakers continue to defend their actions and even blaming the agents there. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=4.4s)]
*  People just are afraid of this un-American hyperactivity, this weaponization of law [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=11.52s)]
*  enforcement. We were getting reports prior to our tour that children were there. We did not know [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=19.44s)]
*  the status of the facility or the status of the detainees. And so that is why we showed up there [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  to do our job. They made this a violent scene that we were unfortunately all a part of and it's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=29.92s)]
*  something that should really shock all Americans. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin joins [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=35.440000000000005s)]
*  us now. So Tricia, I guess the big question is what happened that day? It looks like law enforcement [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=41.36s)]
*  were trying to do what they do every single day is transport people that are illegal that have been [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=45.92s)]
*  put into custody. They normally secure that area. It looks like that the mayor tried to block that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=52.160000000000004s)]
*  as well as members of Congress. What can you tell us? Yeah, Lawrence, these members of Congress and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=57.84s)]
*  protesters, a mob of protesters, stormed this gate to try and enter the detention facility. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  The detention facility holds members of MS-13, child rapists, murderers, arsonists, drug traffickers, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=69.68s)]
*  American killers. And for them to try and get these individuals out is just beyond the pale. We know [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  that the mayor, we know these members of Congress want their 15 minutes of fame so desperately, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=83.92s)]
*  but they're willing to do it at the peril of the safety of our brave law enforcement and even the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=88.4s)]
*  detainees as well, Lawrence. Tricia, why didn't y'all charge them? Because it's simple. We did charge [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  the mayor. Well, not just the mayor, but the members of Congress. I'm looking at them pushing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=99.68s)]
*  on law enforcement trying to get into the facility. If it was any other average American citizen, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=103.28s)]
*  they would have been charged with assault on cop and obstruction of justice. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=109.28s)]
*  They should be charged. Why not? This is an ongoing investigation, Lawrence, but you're [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=113.04s)]
*  absolutely right. These members of Congress, this mayor, and these protesters are not above the law. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=118.0s)]
*  If they had wanted a tour, we will easily facilitate that for them. We actually laid out [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=123.12s)]
*  the guidelines on our DHS Twitter that show you need at least 24 hours of notice to these ICE [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=128.56s)]
*  detention facilities to make sure that staff, that detainees, and that our law enforcement [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=134.72s)]
*  are safe and there's proper protocols and proper channels followed. Here's one of the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=139.28s)]
*  representatives responding to body slamming agents. Let's watch it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=142.88s)]
*  Unless they do not know how to body slam anyone, what you're watching in a video, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=147.6s)]
*  when we don't have all of the body cam, and we hope that all of the body cam is released, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=151.6s)]
*  it was a very tense situation. It unfortunately did not have to be like that. They created that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=156.88s)]
*  confrontation. They created that chaos. So did your agents create this confrontation? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=163.2s)]
*  Absolutely not, Lawrence. They were just simply doing their job and trying to keep the facility [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=169.2s)]
*  safe. Body slamming, body ramming, striking an officer, pushing, shoving, whatever you want to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=173.92s)]
*  call it, it sure looks like assault. People should watch that and decide for themselves. There is no [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=180.0s)]
*  place for that, especially members of Congress. It is so beneath them to be treating law enforcement [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=185.2s)]
*  like this, our brave law enforcement. We thank them for keeping that facility safe and keeping [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=191.84s)]
*  Americans safe every single day. So Tricia, they later got a tour of the facility. What happened [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=196.96s)]
*  once they received a tour? Did they see anything that was wrong? Well, Lawrence, you'll probably [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=202.8s)]
*  remember that part of the reason that they were protesting apparently is because they were saying [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=209.44s)]
*  we didn't have the right permitting, we didn't have the right inspection, which is absolutely [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=213.52s)]
*  false. We had all the right permitting, all the right fire code inspection, electrical [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=217.84s)]
*  inspection, safety inspection. But in a press conference afterward, just showcasing that they [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=221.84s)]
*  want their 15 minutes of fame, they actually said that the conditions in the facility were quite [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=227.84s)]
*  good and up to snuff. So it's pathetic and we won't stand for this in this administration. We're [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=232.56s)]
*  not playing games with the safety of our law enforcement. When can we expect, real quickly, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=238.96s)]
*  because I got to run, when can we expect to hear from law enforcement on if charges are going to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=243.36s)]
*  be pressed? I just think it's a dangerous precedent to set. When should we hear from law enforcement [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=248.24s)]
*  on that? Real quick. I'm going to leave that to the Department of Justice, but this is an ongoing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=254.8s)]
*  investigation and everything's on the table, Lawrence. Roger that. Thank you so much for [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=259.2s)]
*  joining the program. Thank you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=262.64s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPnqiPxJOu0&t=273.36s)]
