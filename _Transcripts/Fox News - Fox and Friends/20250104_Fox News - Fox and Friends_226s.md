# This is 'so damaging' for the FBI, ex-special agent warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE)
*  Well, a Fox News alert, the New Orleans attack [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=0.0s)]
*  exposing America's vulnerabilities [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=3.1s)]
*  as terror incidents increased over the last year. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  These six occurring just over the course of eight months. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=8.68s)]
*  And critics say it could come back [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=12.32s)]
*  to mismanage priorities at the DOJ and FBI. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Here to discuss is former FBI special agent, Nicole Parker. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=17.56s)]
*  Nicole, it's so great to have you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  You're the perfect guest for this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=23.68s)]
*  So let's talk about what the FBI has been focused on. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=26.32s)]
*  I know, for example, I interviewed an FBI whistleblower [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=29.56s)]
*  who was taken off of child sex crimes and put on J6. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=33.04s)]
*  We know that the FBI, for example, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=37.2s)]
*  went after Pete Hegsath, or I'm sorry, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=38.839999999999996s)]
*  the military went after Pete Hegsath for tattoos. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=41.96s)]
*  And the FBI was also focused on white supremacy. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=45.08s)]
*  And we see we have this Islamic radicalization problem. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=48.28s)]
*  So what say you? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=52.04s)]
*  Well, Rachel, first of all, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=54.76s)]
*  I'd like to remind your viewers [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=55.72s)]
*  that I was an FBI special agent for over a dozen years. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=57.36s)]
*  And I really loved being an agent. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=60.0s)]
*  I was a rank and file agent working in the field, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=62.2s)]
*  but you know what? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=64.2s)]
*  It got so bad, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=65.04s)]
*  especially under this current administration [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=67.04s)]
*  that I just walked away. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=69.56s)]
*  I mean, the political and social weaponization [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=70.84s)]
*  that had overtaken the FBI, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=73.18s)]
*  I no longer recognized the agency that I had signed on for. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=75.48s)]
*  And I think that we're seeing this on the national level [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  and it is so awful and catastrophic. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=82.52s)]
*  My heart goes out to those that have lost their loved ones [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=84.78s)]
*  in this absolute disgusting, heinous terrorist attack. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=87.08s)]
*  But what this terrorist attack did [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=90.52s)]
*  was it exposed the FBI's cracks and vulnerabilities [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=92.14s)]
*  on a national level. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=94.92s)]
*  And I have seen these vulnerabilities internally for years, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=96.72s)]
*  which caused myself to walk away [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  and many others have walked away as well. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=102.16s)]
*  They may not be Fox News contributors, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  but I am not the only one. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=105.34s)]
*  And I think this individual, this ASAC, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=106.8s)]
*  who got in front of the media and said, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=109.48s)]
*  definitively, this was not a terrorist attack, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=111.32s)]
*  that is so damaging for the FBI. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=114.64s)]
*  It absolutely was a terrorist attack. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=117.12s)]
*  And people are asking, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=119.56s)]
*  do you think this individual is going to get fired? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=121.0s)]
*  Will she get disciplined? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=123.2s)]
*  In my opinion, not only will she not be disciplined or fired [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=124.6s)]
*  under this current FBI leadership, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=128.82s)]
*  she likely will get promoted. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=130.64s)]
*  And it is baffling to us at the FBI. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=132.6s)]
*  We would see individuals who made massive mistakes [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=135.04s)]
*  and the FBI would actually promote them, Rachel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=137.94s)]
*  It was stunning. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=140.6s)]
*  And again, onto that note, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=142.16s)]
*  Neil Team Six is what we refer to them, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=143.96s)]
*  those that knelt to the BLM protesters [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=146.0s)]
*  in the summer of 2020 [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  in their ballistic FBI vests on official duty. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=149.88s)]
*  That is inappropriate. It is unacceptable. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=152.4s)]
*  You are not allowed to make any sort of social statement. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=154.24s)]
*  We were thinking that those individuals would get fired. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=157.72s)]
*  Not only were they not fired, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=160.24s)]
*  many of them were promoted to highly sought-after positions. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=161.94s)]
*  And the FBI Agents Association [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=165.08s)]
*  offered them $100 gift cards. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=167.24s)]
*  Well, Cash Patel is getting into the FBI. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  Hopefully, he's going to be confirmed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=174.32s)]
*  And the question, of course, is whether he'll be able [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=176.28s)]
*  to change that culture [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=178.27999999999997s)]
*  and how soon he'll be able to turn it around. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=180.27999999999997s)]
*  That is really the question at hand. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  Really fast, can you just tell us if you think that's possible? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=185.48s)]
*  I have faith. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=190.16s)]
*  I want to believe that the FBI will be made great again, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=191.27999999999997s)]
*  but it will take a major shift. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=194.44s)]
*  Cultural shift, hiring. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=196.32s)]
*  You've got to hire people based on meritocracy, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  promotions based on meritocracy, and nothing else. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=200.12s)]
*  And you've got to shift the priorities [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=202.6s)]
*  to protecting the American people. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=203.88s)]
*  If your agenda is to push your social and political agenda, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=205.48s)]
*  then you need to be removed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  Nicole Parker, so great to have you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=210.76s)]
*  Thanks so much. Thanks. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUd7VzPVwE&t=213.23999999999998s)]
