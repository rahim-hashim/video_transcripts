**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM)
*  New reaction to the Colorado terror attack where a man lit a pro-israeli marcher on marchers on fire including [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=0.0s)]
*  12 people including a survivor from the holocaust [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Congresswoman AOC saying quote antisemitism is on the rise here at home [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=9.8s)]
*  And we have a moral responsibility to confront and stop it everywhere it exists really [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=13.84s)]
*  Kevin Euclid's is calling out AOC saying quote Jews are targeted with violence [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=19.68s)]
*  And it's the same virtue signal post post time time again [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=24.28s)]
*  What have you done to confront those calling for infatata in New York City? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=28.48s)]
*  World Series champion former hitting coach for the team Israel in 2023 world baseball classic Kevin Euclid's joins us now [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=33.44s)]
*  Kevin I was I was surprised to see you go directly at AOC, but you're a hundred percent, right? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=40.36s)]
*  She's been invisible for the last two years since the October 7th attacks that bothers you clearly [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, I try to stay out of the political things and try to stay away from as much as possible [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=52.64s)]
*  You know being a figure with your names out there things get a little out of control [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=58.04s)]
*  so I try to stick to what I know best and a lot of that is baseball and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  Just owning a small business now and being in the craft beer world, but for me. I've been following [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=67.68s)]
*  Online a little bit of what people are saying how they're going about it [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=74.8s)]
*  And I think we're just at a point now where the Jewish people are just tired [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=78.56s)]
*  We're tired of having to deal with so much hatred [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=82.6s)]
*  We're tired and you know, and the one thing that I've seen is just a lot of Jewish people are scared [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=85.56s)]
*  I've you know seen a lot of people talk to a lot of people [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=90.6s)]
*  About what they're doing on their own [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=95.36s)]
*  Even got even people becoming gun owners that probably never would been gun owners a long time ago and we're anti guns [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=97.84s)]
*  But for me and and what I've seen and in the rhetoric [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=104.28s)]
*  it's just [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=108.68s)]
*  Globalized antifada is a triggering word for a lot of Jewish people and for Israelis [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=110.2s)]
*  For people that don't know about the antifadas you do the research on it [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=116.28s)]
*  It's not even just about Jewish people antifadas create chaos and create a lot of destruction [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=120.36s)]
*  on both sides of the fight and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=126.12s)]
*  When we hear this rhetoric and has pushed out in our universe [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=128.36s)]
*  And on the streets it just has to stop it is it just it brings a lot of fear [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=131.44000000000003s)]
*  It stokes the violence and unfortunately, we're just in a really tough time right now [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=136.96s)]
*  And you know the one thing about what I've learned is being Jewish is [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=141.52s)]
*  And the Israeli, you know national anthem is hatikva. It's the hope [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=146.08s)]
*  We always live for the hope of a better day and there will be a better day. It's just right now [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=150.4s)]
*  We're in some tough times, right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=154.88000000000002s)]
*  You're gonna finish off Hamas and things will be better [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  Like you did like the Israeli said with Israel and then sooner or later we got to deal with Iran [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=159.2s)]
*  And things people realize that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  Israel is a salvation. They're not the problem the anti-semitism medic attacks in New York City [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=166.56s)]
*  I know being for a boston guy, you're not used to being embraced in New York City anyway [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=171.76s)]
*  But that's in a fun way you're talking about 74 attacks between January and March of this year [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  350 in 2024 [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  160 October 7th in 2020 [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  323 so they're only going up kevin. What would it do for a democrat like schumer jewish american? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=184.96s)]
*  For be aggressively against this for aoc with a high profile way to the left [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  Aggressively against it and you brought up richie taurez a democrat from new york who is aggressively against? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=196.4s)]
*  uh [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=204.4s)]
*  Pushing back against the anti-semitic actions [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, richie taurez has been a fabulous [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=209.12s)]
*  In the way he has spoken out and I think that's what most should follow, you know, this isn't a political issue this is in in aoc's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=212.16s)]
*  Post it says the moral issue [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=219.6s)]
*  We are dealing with a moral issue right now in what kind of country we want to live in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=221.6s)]
*  And the united states of america is home to a lot of jewish families because a lot of jewish families left [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=225.44s)]
*  Persecution and and leaving the holocaust and my family came from romania. Luckily by the way [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=232.0s)]
*  The holocaust but they were being persecuted across europe and came to the united states for a better tomorrow [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think right now [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=244.8s)]
*  As jewish, you know individuals here in america that have heard the stories of our ancestors that have have [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=247.2s)]
*  Heard the atrocities that they went through [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=253.6s)]
*  We thought we were past a lot of this growing up. I I felt a lot safer [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=256.4s)]
*  But what i'm starting to realize and see as an adult my kids went to a jcc [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=261.28s)]
*  And there's armed security guards at jcc's synagogues [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=267.28s)]
*  You know just all kinds of schools and the death threats that keep happening around it is [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=271.68s)]
*  It's just awful and I think the one thing for us and what we're looking for is just leadership [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  You know first amendment rights are first amendment rights and i'm a firm believer in that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=283.76s)]
*  Uh, you know first amendment rights are first amendment rights and i'm a firm believer in that as an american and a proud american [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  But we also have to have our leadership that can decipher between [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=293.28s)]
*  What is hate? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  And how people are going to build upon it? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=299.52s)]
*  Uh, you know these stories and I I look out and I read a lot. I try to go out there and educate myself [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=301.84s)]
*  But we also have an issue with journalistic intent. Uh, we are a society that is really big on headline reading right now [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=308.4s)]
*  And there we just saw a false narrative being pushed on cnn b [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=316.48s)]
*  bbc and the new york times about uh the aid station in israel and that is hard because [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=320.8s)]
*  We are at a boiling point [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=327.76s)]
*  And in our society where people might act upon that and we have to we have to be better [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=329.6s)]
*  Uh, and we have to be a better society here in america [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=335.04s)]
*  And they pointed out erroneously that the idf was opening up at people looking to get aid and they weren't [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=337.68s)]
*  They reported it as if it's fact and it wasn't in fact this video of hamas shooting palestinians to keep them from getting that aid [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=343.28s)]
*  So it's important to get it right kevin euclous. Thanks for what you do. Hopefully you continue to speak out [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, have a great day you too i'm steve juicy i'm brian killme [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmN7P87DvOM&t=356.64s)]
