# Ft. Myers Beach mayor gives update on Milton's aftermath: 'Battle-tested'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM)
*  Let's go to the other side of the state for Myers Beach and the surrounding [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=0.0s)]
*  area seeing massive flooding and had winds up to 120 miles per hour last [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  night. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=8.56s)]
*  Fort Myers Beach Mayor Dan Allers joins us now. Mr. Mayor, uh, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=9.72s)]
*  Fort Myers been through so much over the last few years. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=14.52s)]
*  How would you characterize what you went through last night and what are you [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=17.0s)]
*  seeing today? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=19.76s)]
*  Well, this is our fifth storm in two years. So, uh, to say we're battle tested, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  I guess it'd be an understatement. The sun just came up. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=26.2s)]
*  We've been down here since about three o'clock this morning. Uh, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=28.64s)]
*  pictures you're seeing there of Margaritaville, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=31.3s)]
*  some of the stuff we were able to get when we first got down here this morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=33.4s)]
*  Um, it's, it's worse than Helene, uh, but not as bad as Ian, obviously. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=36.72s)]
*  So we're thankful that everybody took us serious when we said evacuate. Um, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=40.32s)]
*  it's really sped up the process for search and rescue for our fire department, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=44.6s)]
*  which will allow us to get our residents back on island and start to clean up [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  sooner than we normally would. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  So we just want to take a second to thank everyone for heating the warning and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=52.32s)]
*  getting off the island when they did. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=55.92s)]
*  You were out there, uh, warning the public, Mr. Mayor. What's your immediate [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  concern right now as, as the sun is up now? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=62.0s)]
*  Uh, our immediate concern is getting the road open so that we can get water [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=66.48s)]
*  restored and get power back on so we can get our residents back on. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=69.6s)]
*  They're patiently waiting off island. I'm sure to, uh, to get on the island. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=72.64s)]
*  We've got water hopefully in the middle of the day. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=76.32s)]
*  By the end of the day we can get that restored. Uh, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=78.08s)]
*  we haven't gotten an update yet from FPL to see exactly when we can get some [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  power. Uh, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=83.28s)]
*  but those are our two biggest concerns right now is to get our main Boulevard, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=84.32s)]
*  the stairable Boulevard cleared off to get people back here as soon as they [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=87.16s)]
*  possibly can. Uh, Mr. Mayor, what about a cell phone towers? Because I, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=90.28s)]
*  I know the electricity is out in many cases, uh, but what about once people get [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=94.64s)]
*  there, they're going to expect their phone to work. Will it? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=99.56s)]
*  Um, so far mine has worked. I'm actually talking to you on it right now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=103.8s)]
*  So, so far it's, it's working. Um, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if they are backup generator took water or not. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=108.92s)]
*  I haven't been able to get by the tower that's on the island to see if that's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  the generator is still running. Uh, depending on where you're at on the island, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=114.96s)]
*  some ends got a little, one end got more than the other. Um, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=119.0s)]
*  and they're kind of in the middle, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=121.96s)]
*  but that's right about where that house was that came off at stilts. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  So now we've got some daylight. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  We'll be able to really assess what we've got to deal with and get it cleaning [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=128.04s)]
*  up as fast as we can. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=131.2s)]
*  Yeah. And when you compare the storm to Ian, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=132.84s)]
*  Ian was two years ago when we were reporting on that, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=134.84s)]
*  there was so much water and that was probably your biggest problem. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=136.92s)]
*  Right? So when you compare these two, you say this one, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=141.76s)]
*  overnight was not as bad as Ian. Was it because of the water damage with Ian? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=144.88s)]
*  Well, it wasn't the amount. Yes. You know, Ian, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  we had 15 to 17 feet of storm surge. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=151.48s)]
*  Best guess right now we were probably in that six to 10 range, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=153.96s)]
*  depending on where you're at on the island. Again, it's daylight. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=157.04s)]
*  Now we'll get a better assessment. I don't know if you can see it behind me, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=160.0s)]
*  but there's a boat that floated to the park from one of our marinas here, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=162.16s)]
*  which is a couple, two, three blocks away. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=166.24s)]
*  So it was obviously a significant amount of water here that moved a lot of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=168.88s)]
*  things around and shifted houses off their, off their piling. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=171.56s)]
*  So there was quite a water surge event here, obviously, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=174.36s)]
*  probably not as bad as our, our sister barrier islands to the north. You know, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=177.56s)]
*  we pray for them and we understand what they're going through, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  having to take this, this storm, you know, on the chin, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=184.72000000000003s)]
*  like we did two years ago. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=187.08s)]
*  We'll get our mess cleaned up and help them as soon as we can. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  Safe to say the worst is over. As I look around, I don't see the wind, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  I don't see any rain. So it's gone. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=195.52s)]
*  Yeah. The water is receded off the island. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=199.52s)]
*  We do still have standing water on some of the side streets. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=201.6s)]
*  As tight as going down here, we'll start to see some of that drain out. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=204.76s)]
*  Then we'll be able to really see what's laying in on the ground and get, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=208.92s)]
*  get those wires out of the way and, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  and get it cleaned up so people can drive onto the island. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=213.72s)]
*  Sure. Mr. Mayor, before the storm, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=216.0s)]
*  there was a worry that there was so much debris in a number of West coast towns [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=217.92s)]
*  from Helene, still out on the streets, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=222.68s)]
*  waiting to get carted off by debris haulers. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=225.64s)]
*  Did you guys have that problem? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=228.84s)]
*  Because once you have a hurricane come through with 120 mile per hour winds, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=230.04s)]
*  those just become gigantic flying projectiles. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we were fortunate. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=240.2s)]
*  We pulled two of our contractors that we have doing other projects, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  stormwater projects and beach re-nurser projects on the island to, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=244.88s)]
*  to assist with removing a lot of this sand. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  Our partners at Lee County brought a lot of their trucks and equipment down, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=250.72s)]
*  plus our staff. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  So I'd say we had about 90 to 95% of the, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=254.76000000000002s)]
*  the Helena debris picked up before, before this storm hit. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=257.72s)]
*  So we were fortunate in that aspect, but we didn't quite get it all. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=263.08000000000004s)]
*  All right. Mr. Mayor, thanks so much. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=266.88s)]
*  The Mayor of Tampa said, don't come back yet. Check our website. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  We'll tell you when we're ready for you, for people. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=271.44s)]
*  I wonder if they can go back if they live in the Fort Myers area. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=273.68s)]
*  I think we lost him. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=276.32s)]
*  I think you know what he was saying early, the roads weren't clear yet. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=277.16s)]
*  That's right. That might be the answer. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c27A4rIefM&t=279.92s)]
