# Hegseth to visit southern border in first trip as defense secretary
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc)
*  We are starting with a Fox News alert. Pete Hegsath is making his first trip as Secretary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=0.0s)]
*  of Defense this morning traveling to Fort Bliss, Texas to visit our southern border. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=7.36s)]
*  Secretary Hegsath saying in a post on X, quote, POTUS wants 100% operational control of the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=12.8s)]
*  border and we will deliver. Border security is national security. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=19.8s)]
*  Absolutely right. And you know what? We've already seen results from the Trump administration's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=23.6s)]
*  deportation push over just two weeks. Nearly 8,000 arrests and over 5,500 detainers have [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=27.76s)]
*  been lodged by ICE during just his first two weeks in office. Remember, he was sworn in [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  two weeks ago today. Secretary Hegsath is said to be visiting Joint [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=40.32s)]
*  Task Force North today, which is headquartered at Fort Bliss and has been providing support [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=43.92s)]
*  to the border mission so far. And we know this overall, and it stunned me with Maria. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=49.660000000000004s)]
*  He said, did Tom Holman, border crossings are now 93%. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=56.0s)]
*  Oh my goodness. In two weeks. I'm surprised 7% are still trying to get [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=60.4s)]
*  across because it's pretty much an iron curtain. Let's check in with Lawrence. Normally right [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=65.12s)]
*  here, right now he's down in El Paso before he meets with Pete Hegsath who's going to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=71.28s)]
*  make his first trip to the southern border. And you know what, LJ, it makes perfect sense [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=76.36s)]
*  that the Department of Defense is involved in our southern border because that's the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=80.22s)]
*  first line of defense. Let me tell you, it's incredible what I'm [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=84.92s)]
*  seeing here. I've been covering the border for years as you guys know, and I've never [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=89.46000000000001s)]
*  seen operational control this way. Essentially, we're reporting on the deterrent because you [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  don't see a lot of runners. You don't see a lot of people trying to surrender their [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=101.2s)]
*  self to border patrol because they can't get across the border. There is manpower like [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  I've never seen. There's spirit like I've never seen. And yesterday I had the opportunity [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=110.12s)]
*  to talk to the Secretary of Homeland Security. This is what she said. Watch. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=114.68s)]
*  So, Lawrence, guys, just to put it in perspective, you can see it on their faces. The border [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=144.68s)]
*  patrol, they're different. They're happy. You're seeing smiles, hugs, because people [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=151.28s)]
*  can actually do their jobs again, Brian. Well, there's a ground total of support. People [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=155.56s)]
*  are asking me, you know, why aren't you at the border, Brian? Why can't you go? And then [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=159.8s)]
*  I see the opening shot and it's Lawrence on a horse. And that is, you know, I'm a [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm not going to use it all. Right. No explanation needed. Brian, you've been on a horse. The [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=169.6s)]
*  horse just never moved. Exactly. Lawrence, on a serious note, this means that the Texas [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=173.84s)]
*  National Guard will now have authority to arrest illegal immigrants. They didn't have [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=181.92s)]
*  that authority before. That's exactly right. Because it's a federal statute, they really [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=186.28s)]
*  don't have the authority to do that. But that changed. It's something that many of us who've [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=192.16s)]
*  been out here have been calling for because they would always say, Greg Abbott, you have these [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=196.92s)]
*  people down here, here, they can't really do much because of the laws on the books. It's a simple [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  fix. And Secretary Terry Noem and the president did it. They just deputized them as federal [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=206.83999999999997s)]
*  agents. We see this a lot in federal task force as well, where they will deputize locals. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=211.48s)]
*  They're doing the same thing for these National Guards as well, guys. But it just goes to show [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  you how it's the whole of government. It's not just the feds, particularly where you are down [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  in Texas, it's Texas as well. So rather than, you know, us hearing for the last four years, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=226.56s)]
*  oh, Greg Abbott, he can't even touch him because the federal authorities control the border. Now [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=231.6s)]
*  the state is helping the feds. Might not be the same case in Arizona or New Mexico, but it is in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=238.32s)]
*  Texas. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  So let me give some color to this. Some of this stuff has just been over complicated. All right, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=247.04s)]
*  let me give you an example. Yesterday, we were on the on the horses with the mounting unit. One of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=252.6s)]
*  the agents said, listen, some of our equipment is outdated. And I'm wondering, Secretary, if you [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=257.64s)]
*  can get this approved, you know, she goes, I'll sign the invoice when we get back to the office. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=264.12s)]
*  Like, let's just get this going. This doesn't have to go through all this bureaucracy. If you guys [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=269.6s)]
*  need things to keep the American public safe, let's just get it going. And just to look on these [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=275.52s)]
*  guys faces like you can do that. We haven't been using the tools that we have authorized to us. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=281.16s)]
*  And this administration, I know there's been some bumps in the road, but they're simplifying the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=288.0s)]
*  process of getting things done. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=294.36s)]
*  Right. I'll tell you what, there's so many different facets to it, one of which is the crackdown [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=297.72s)]
*  of illegals in our midst of criminals first. And that is upset sanctuary cities and people, for [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=302.0s)]
*  example, in Los Angeles, you think they would have enough in their plate, but instead at nine [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=308.6s)]
*  o'clock in the morning, a social media post went out, go out and protest and shut down streets. And [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  that's what happened. Looky go. Let's fast forward to Los Angeles yesterday. Listen, watch. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  So a lot of people were happy to know that Donald Trump in a matter of 10 days is almost arrested. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=331.16s)]
*  8000 illegal immigrants. But you see there there are pockets of our country that are not for it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=337.72s)]
*  This happened in L.A. They shut down the 101 freeway. Police described it as a non permitted [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  demonstration and a dispersal order was issued at 6 p.m. to get those protesters off the streets and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  off the freeway. People were waving Mexican signs and holding up other signs. Right. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=354.44s)]
*  To win over America is not to wave the Mexican flag in America. By the way, attention protesters, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=358.12s)]
*  if you're watching, if you could see a close up on some of the signs in addition to the flags of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=363.4s)]
*  El Salvador and of Mexico as well, there were some signs that said mega stands for Mexicans [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=369.0s)]
*  always get across. Also, don't don't bite the hand that feeds you. At seven o'clock, they did call a [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=376.12s)]
*  tactical alert. They were worried that it could spiral into violence. None of that happened. But [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=384.03999999999996s)]
*  nonetheless, it was clearly an anti ice message. They were trying to make it very clear. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=389.48s)]
*  There may be a new sheriff in town. We don't like the sheriff. But Lawrence, couldn't they have [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=395.48s)]
*  cleared that out? Couldn't they have cleared that out? A non permitted demonstration. The streets [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=399.64000000000004s)]
*  got to be opened up. They could have cleared that out. I bet you there was a stand down order already [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=405.48s)]
*  overwhelmed in that area. Well, there's some reporting on the ground, especially from some [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=410.36s)]
*  of my sources in LAPD. They were given the order to arrest and then suddenly they were called off. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=416.68s)]
*  So I don't know what happened there, but you cannot obstruct public traffic. You just can't do that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=422.6s)]
*  And then to your point, Brian, if everything is going so well in the countries that you hold the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=427.88s)]
*  flags there, why don't you go back to those countries? I mean, it just doesn't make any sense [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=434.12s)]
*  to me. Also, when you look at what ISIS doing, what DOJ is doing, they don't have the resources [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=439.56s)]
*  for the second phase yet. These guys are burned out already just going after the criminals. But [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=447.32s)]
*  it's because of some of the media reporting, some of the fear mongering is going out there that [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=453.08s)]
*  they're saying things that are simply not true about what I mean. What do you mean? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=457.24s)]
*  And the rest of the Department of Justice is doing. What do you mean by that? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=462.2s)]
*  Right. Well, they're saying that they're going after American citizens for one. Number two, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=465.4s)]
*  they said that they're going after abuelas and going after children. They don't have the resource [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=471.08s)]
*  to do it. You're sending 20 to 30 guys in a stack to go after criminal aliens right now. People that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=475.79999999999995s)]
*  have committed crimes, they don't have the resources to go door to door to go to churches [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=481.56s)]
*  and all that. They're just not enough manpower right now to accomplish that. Number two, there [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=487.15999999999997s)]
*  is a difference between an American citizen being detained and questioned and getting information [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=492.28s)]
*  and then being put in the jail and deported to another country. That happens all the time [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=498.35999999999996s)]
*  when you see traffic stop. Well, they'll detain officers who will get more information. And once [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=503.55999999999995s)]
*  they check everything out, they release people. But of course, the media is not adding that context. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=508.28s)]
*  Right. And the media in Los Angeles is showing exactly what we're showing right here. And keep [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=513.8s)]
*  in mind, the reason they did not arrest, there weren't massive arrests after that or during that [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=519.16s)]
*  was it's a sanctuary city. It's a sanctuary state. Karen Bass doesn't want to arrest those people. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=525.3199999999999s)]
*  Gavin Newsom doesn't want to arrest those people. And they like the idea, the messaging. Hey, look, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=530.6s)]
*  you might see these raids all across the country, but there are people who are resisting Donald [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=535.64s)]
*  Trump. And that was the message they were trying to get at us yesterday. What is the morale on the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=541.0799999999999s)]
*  border? What are the border patrol agents saying now that, you know, we're about two weeks into his [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=545.24s)]
*  presidency? They're happy. And I'm gonna tell you something, these aren't people. Look, they were [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=548.92s)]
*  grateful that the Secretary of Homeland came to the border, but it wasn't really about that. It [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=556.1999999999999s)]
*  wasn't really about politicians coming to the border. It's the fact that they can do their job [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  again. They can go after the bad guys. They can go out on chases. They can take the drugs off the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=567.16s)]
*  street. Remember, these same guys have been processing. You had the Whipgate situation with [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=572.04s)]
*  the Haitian migrants. That was a total fraud. And they removed the Malty unit from the border, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=578.04s)]
*  which is stupid. These guys, these horses are training, cutting to cut off runners, as well as [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=584.8399999999999s)]
*  the drug cartels when they're trying to get product across the border. So there's been a lot of policy [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJIfcj80lxc&t=590.76s)]
