# Putin threatens Trump on effort to acquire Greenland: 'Will not allow encroachments'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0)
*  So Ukraine President Zelensky is urging the US to respond with action after he says Russia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=0.0s)]
*  violated the partial ceasefire by damaging his country's energy infrastructure. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  There says North Korea is sending 3,000 more troops to the Russian front lines. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=12.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=17.12s)]
*  Former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman served in Moscow. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=18.12s)]
*  One of his stops could tell us what he thinks. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=20.68s)]
*  So we thought we had an agreement on no energy infrastructure and no hits in the Black Sea. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=23.2s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=29.28s)]
*  Well Vladimir Putin will say one thing for media consumption. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=32.2s)]
*  That's a lot of lies and obfuscation and it's what he's been doing since he was in the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=36.04s)]
*  KGB decades ago. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=39.96s)]
*  And then his army will carry on these attacks because his strategic objective, Brian, continues [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  to be to topple the government of Ukraine, install a puppet regime, and concurrently [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=47.52s)]
*  try to drive a wedge between the United States and Ukraine and between the United States [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=52.56s)]
*  and our European NATO partners. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=56.74s)]
*  So we have to make him pay a price if these talks collapse. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=58.9s)]
*  That would be more sanctions, enforcing the ones in place, and possibly flood Ukraine [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=63.04s)]
*  with even more weapons. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=68.5s)]
*  There's got to be some type of hell to pay if Russia continues to be insincere to this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=70.25999999999999s)]
*  point and try to do a delay again with the talks, right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=75.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think all of those policy options are on the table. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=80.18s)]
*  Look, I was in Hanoi covering the summit there when President Trump walked away from a bad [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=84.38s)]
*  deal with Kim Jong-un. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=89.02s)]
*  Sometimes you have to do that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=91.42s)]
*  And just overnight breaking, Iran wants to negotiate over their nuclear program. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  So we need to continue to show that we're good, tough negotiators and to ensure that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=98.18s)]
*  our national security is at the forefront of our policy decisions. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=103.06s)]
*  That's what the Trump administration is doing and that's what they need to do in this case. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=107.48s)]
*  Europe will take the lead on defending their continent at the point of attack and we can [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=111.3s)]
*  be there supporting them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=114.86s)]
*  Yeah, Iran last night responded to the president's letter from a few weeks ago and said it's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=116.62s)]
*  open to indirect nuclear negotiations with the United States but rejects direct negotiations. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=121.42s)]
*  So delay a game, we don't have much time to delay. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=127.1s)]
*  It's going to be a tough decision. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=130.26s)]
*  So here's what Vladimir Putin said about our plans with Greenland tongue in cheek. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=131.82s)]
*  We will now allow encroachments on the sovereignty, we will not allow encroachments on the sovereignty [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=135.42s)]
*  of our country and will reliably protect our national interests. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=139.5s)]
*  What do they have to do with Greenland? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=143.22s)]
*  Are they talking about Arctic? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, Vladimir Putin wants the world to believe that Russia is able to stand toe to toe with [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=148.38s)]
*  the United States militarily and diplomatically. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=154.17999999999998s)]
*  So if there's an issue of interest to the United States, Vladimir Putin is just going [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=156.77999999999997s)]
*  to weigh in on it because remember, he's talked about the greatest geopolitical disaster of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=160.66s)]
*  the last century was the collapse of the Soviet Union. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=166.89999999999998s)]
*  So he arkons back to those days when United States and Soviet leaders would gather and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=169.26s)]
*  solve the world's problems. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=174.38s)]
*  That's just not the way it is anymore but he'd like the world to think it is. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=175.7s)]
*  Earlier this week, Vladimir Zelensky in an interview, I think it was with the Daily Mail, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=180.18s)]
*  came out and said, don't worry, Vladimir Putin will be dead soon. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=183.82s)]
*  He sees his mortality and everything he does. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=187.22s)]
*  What's he building that on? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=189.9s)]
*  I don't know that there's any indication that Vladimir Putin is going to be gone anytime [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=193.14s)]
*  soon but keep in mind that when he is gone, there's no indication that there won't be [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=198.1s)]
*  some other KGB or Russian intelligence officer to take his place. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=203.06s)]
*  That's why I think we need to make this war more of a loser for Putin than it already [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=207.78s)]
*  has been. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=212.70000000000002s)]
*  Make it clear that imperial land grabs of this sort won't be tolerated and that we and our [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  allies will stand up against them and defend against a violation of a country's territorial [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=218.66000000000003s)]
*  integrity and sovereignty. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  And lastly, we have a situation with the ongoing negotiations with Ukraine and Russia. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=226.78s)]
*  You say if we really want to know what Vladimir Putin's thinking rather than looking at what [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=234.18s)]
*  he's saying, we should go to CIA Director Radcliffe. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=238.38s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=241.74s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=244.14000000000001s)]
*  Vladimir Putin will obfuscate and lie publicly. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=245.14000000000001s)]
*  He does it all the time. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=248.02s)]
*  In my experience at CIA, having spent years tracking Putin and trying to see the world [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=249.54000000000002s)]
*  through his twisted KGB eyes, we always relied on our human source intelligence and our signals [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=254.02s)]
*  intelligence to understand what Putin's real intentions were and his real plans. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=259.62s)]
*  And I think that's the key to understanding Russia. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=265.06s)]
*  Look, Putin lives in a KGB cocoon. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=268.78s)]
*  He doesn't want us to understand what's going on in his country so that he can lie and obfuscate. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=271.3s)]
*  But GCI Radcliffe has a great team behind him and I'm sure the president is asking him [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=276.14s)]
*  every day for all of those secrets about Russia and Putin and his team. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=280.78s)]
*  And I think President Trump's eyes are wide open. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=285.46s)]
*  He was asked, what about Russia? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=286.94s)]
*  Are they trying to just delay these talks and string him out? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=288.3s)]
*  He said he might be. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=290.97999999999996s)]
*  Okay? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=292.78s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=293.78s)]
*  In other words, my eyes are open. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=294.78s)]
*  I'm not going to wait too much longer. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=295.78s)]
*  Dan Hoffman, thanks so much. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIBEehpua0&t=297.06s)]
