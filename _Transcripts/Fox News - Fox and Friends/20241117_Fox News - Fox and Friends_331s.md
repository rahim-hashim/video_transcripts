# Expert exposes ‘how afraid’ the Biden admin was of China
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k)
*  We haven't always agreed, but our conversations have always been candid and always been frank. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=0.0s)]
*  We have never kidded one another. We've been level with one another. I think that's vital. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  These conversations prevent miscalculations and they ensure the competition between our two [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=12.4s)]
*  countries will not veer into conflict. The competition, not conflict. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=17.12s)]
*  Mr. President, are you concerned about U.S.-China relations under the incoming Trump administration? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  U.S. suppressions, I guess. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=28.72s)]
*  President Biden dodging when pressed about U.S. ties to China under Trump as he awkwardly stands [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  in the back corner of the APEC conference annual photo with world leaders with Chinese President [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=37.92s)]
*  Xi placed front and center. Our next guest says Trump's reset of the U.S.-China relationship is [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  probably one of the most underappreciated accomplishments of his first term. Fox News [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=49.36s)]
*  contributor Michael Pillsbury joins us now. Michael, good morning. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=54.4s)]
*  Good morning, Rachel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  I saw that picture. Not only was Biden in the background, but that entire event was overshadowed [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=60.32s)]
*  by the fact that China had a port, a $3.5 billion point port that they're inaugurating or opening up [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=65.44s)]
*  in Peru. And so another symbol of the power, the commercial power and interests of China [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=75.12s)]
*  that we have neglected. So talk to us about what that moment looks like, why it's bad that our [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=81.68s)]
*  president is in the back, whether we like Biden or not, and how that could change because President [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=88.64s)]
*  Trump is now assuming ascending into power. I think the change when President Trump takes power [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=93.44000000000001s)]
*  will be just enormous. He already turned the Washington point of view on China around when [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=101.76s)]
*  he was in his first term. But I think you know, Rachel, he was failed by a lot of his appointees [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=108.08s)]
*  who didn't agree with him on China. They were really quite pro-China, didn't want to make any [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=114.0s)]
*  trouble. What has happened now, three big things that are newsworthy. The first is he's assembling [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=117.84s)]
*  a team of people who think the same way he does on China, not only Marco Rubio, Mike Walls, but also [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  he's talked to The Wall Street Journal, which he reported yesterday. He wants Bob Lighthizer to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=131.12s)]
*  come back and be his trade czar, sort of oversee commerce and treasury and other departments in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=136.08s)]
*  terms of trade. That means the first thing they'll want to do is restore the trade agreement where [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=141.12s)]
*  China promised $200 billion to really greatly increase American jobs. The second thing is you [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=145.84s)]
*  see in a picture like this, it shows the timidity. It shows how much the Biden team was afraid of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  China and they just couldn't get the fentanyl deal done. So China is still, you won't believe this, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=159.12s)]
*  Rachel, but China and its IRS type websites gives companies a tax break for selling fentanyl [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=165.2s)]
*  precursors that go into America and kill tens of thousands of Americans. So this is high on the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=173.28s)]
*  agenda, Mr. Trump told me. The third thing is really more important than anything else, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=179.04s)]
*  he's concerned about nuclear war. So trying to bring a ceasefire in Ukraine, people don't associate [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  China and the power of China over Russia. That if the Chinese say no more, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=191.6s)]
*  we're not helping you anymore, you've got to have a ceasefire in the Ukraine, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  Putin has to listen to that. It's the secret way Trump has already described to me in a long meeting [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  that he wants to bring Chinese pressure on Russia to stop Ukraine. They've also, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  he's got the Chinese to openly say, this is during the campaign, Chinese openly said, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=212.96s)]
*  we don't want nuclear escalation, we don't want to expand the war, sovereignty is important. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=217.84s)]
*  These are things that have already made Russia kind of angry at China. So you see what Trump [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=223.52s)]
*  can do. He's promising a Ukraine peace plan during the time he's president-elect, that's the next two [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=228.8s)]
*  months. So the team is there, the Chinese are already giving positive signs, and it's going [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  to be the end of this Biden timidity that lets the fentanyl come in. And also, Biden just did not [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=239.52s)]
*  start trade talks at all. Remember how important that was under Trump? Notice there's no trade [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=246.8s)]
*  talks with China, because the Chinese refused to come. It's really quite an opportunity for [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=252.16000000000003s)]
*  Trump to get leverage and get things done with China. Really quick, one last question. You say [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=258.16s)]
*  that the deep state, the national security establishment, those bureaucrats want to stop [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=263.6s)]
*  Donald Trump in this next term, because Wall Street gets rich and somehow they're doing the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=269.04s)]
*  work of Wall Street, who gets rich from not dealing with China and its military ambitions. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=275.84s)]
*  I don't have a lot of time, but if you could just address that quickly, because I think people [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=283.44s)]
*  don't understand that connection. Yeah, I think President Trump knows this. There'll be deep state [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  resistance to his China policy. So his appointments are really, really important. Right now, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=292.0s)]
*  he, Marco Rubio, he's a China expert. Each department of the government's got to have [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=296.88s)]
*  an assistant secretary for China. If those people are deep state, then it'd be very hard [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=302.08s)]
*  for Trump to succeed. He's got to have a lot of people who agree with him in the various posts. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=307.76s)]
*  I think that's going to happen. At least I hope it's going to happen, Rachel, don't you? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  Yes. Yes. Michael Pillsbury, you're always on top of this topic. Thanks for joining us this morning. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSlm5rrCc6k&t=315.59999999999997s)]
