# Gang leader wanted for 23 murders was released into US: ICE
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg)
*  So Ainsley, new Fox, new polls are out and Trump has a sizable advantage over Harris on immigration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=0.0s)]
*  and the border. 87 percent of voters say the border is an emergency and a major problem. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=6.24s)]
*  Yep, that's right and 71 percent of voters say the Biden-Harris administration is responsible [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=11.44s)]
*  for the border crisis. Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins is here to react. Griff, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=16.88s)]
*  if this is true, if the number one issue is economy and inflation, number two, what we're [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=22.0s)]
*  hearing or what we're seeing in polls is the border. Trump looks like he would do really well [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=26.16s)]
*  in this election. Well, and good morning, Lawrence and Ainsley. Let's connect some dots here. It's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=31.44s)]
*  not surprising, I think, that nearly nine in ten Americans are deeply concerned about the border [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=36.16s)]
*  because of the deluge of almost daily incidences of migrant crime that we're seeing. Look, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=41.28s)]
*  the officials knew, this administration knew three and a half years ago when they started [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=47.2s)]
*  mass releasing people that included single adult males, that this would be the result, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=51.68s)]
*  a public safety issue and a national security issue. Just look at yesterday. We learned on [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=56.72s)]
*  Wednesday ICE arrested a Peruvian gang leader wanted for 23 murders. He's the head of Los [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=62.0s)]
*  Killers, the most dangerous gang in Peru. He illegally crossed in May in Roma, Texas of this [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=68.56s)]
*  year. Two months later, they realized after he had been released on a notice to appear [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=74.24s)]
*  that they needed to bring him into custody. Now, when they took him into custody, ICE did what they [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=79.12s)]
*  had to do to secure the community from that threat. And remember Harris back in 2020 in an [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=84.56s)]
*  interview said that she wanted to start over from scratch, essentially eliminating ICE. But don't [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=91.04s)]
*  stop there. This week alone, we've seen the Haitian migrant that raped a pregnant woman, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=96.4s)]
*  another Haitian migrant that raped a teenage girl in a Massachusetts hotel. He came through the legal [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=101.12s)]
*  pathway that CHNV. You've got the Singles migrant, the raped woman on a park bench in the Bronx, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=106.48s)]
*  and that could go on and on. The point is that the American people aren't blind and they're seeing, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=111.68s)]
*  I think Ainsley, the results, the consequences, in some cases, horrific, tragic and deadly [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  consequences of the policies with respect to the border that this administration has applied. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=123.28s)]
*  So, Griff, obviously you just talked about the criminal element of this issue, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=128.96s)]
*  but another part of that is when it comes to the drugs that are coming across the border, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=132.56s)]
*  and that's affecting every major American city. And you got a new Fox Nation special about that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=136.72s)]
*  That's right. Thanks, Lawrence. And it's called Fentanyl, America's Quiet Killer. Look, Fentanyl [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=142.72s)]
*  is the deadliest drug threat the U.S. has ever faced. It's been years in the making and it touches [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=146.96s)]
*  every single town in every state in this nation. Here's a little sample of our special that's live [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=152.08s)]
*  now on Fox Nation. It's cheap, potent, and addictive, and it's silently ripping our nation apart. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=158.32s)]
*  In that moment, had I known, I wouldn't have let go. This is Fentanyl, America's Quiet Killer. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=168.0s)]
*  That's Andrea Thomas, a grieving mother. We also interview the DEA administrator, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=178.32s)]
*  Ann Milgram, in an exclusive interview along with the head of the CBP, Troy Miller, that walks us [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=183.68s)]
*  through the battle against the cartels in Mexico and trying to stop that supply chain that starts [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=189.12s)]
*  in China. Gosh, those stories break my heart. I mean, all it takes is one mistake, one child who [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=195.04s)]
*  orders it on social media. The back of an eraser or pencil can kill you. That's all it takes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=201.92s)]
*  It does, guys. Just two milligrams of Fentanyl powder could kill you. That's about the weight [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=207.68s)]
*  of a mosquito, guys. I mean, what do we do? You have to talk to your kids, but I mean, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=212.96s)]
*  we all did stupid things. Just don't experiment. You cannot do drugs at all. You don't know where [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  it came from. Exactly. I'll just add this. On a personal note, I just this week dropped off my [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=223.44s)]
*  18-year-old daughter at college and I told her, I said, listen, I want you to have fun. Do what [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=229.52s)]
*  you know all the kids are doing. Don't do drugs, but most importantly, don't take a pill because [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=234.72s)]
*  the cartels are making pills that look like Adderall or Xanax or anything the kids might [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=240.48s)]
*  experiment with. They make these Fentanyl pills and in a moment's notice, you're dead because of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=245.76s)]
*  these pills. Don't take a drink from someone unless it's a bartender. If you drop it down, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  if you leave the drink, don't pick it back up. Exactly. You don't know what they put in there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=255.6s)]
*  If we're going to be catching your special on Fox Nation, we urge our audience to do the same [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfsT8r8iaQg&t=259.52s)]
