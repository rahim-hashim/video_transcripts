# Supreme Court blocks Biden-Harris changes to Title IX
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k)
*  Meanwhile, the Supreme Court blocking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=0.0s)]
*  enforcement of the Biden Harris [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=2.1s)]
*  Administration's changes to Title 9, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=4.1s)]
*  which would have broadened [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=5.8s)]
*  definitions to include gender identity. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=7.28s)]
*  The High Court siding with a growing [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  number of states that called for a stop [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=11.3s)]
*  to what they say is an unlawful rule [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=13.84s)]
*  against girls Louisiana Attorney General [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=16.52s)]
*  Liz Murrell helped lead that fight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=18.48s)]
*  This sparked the Supreme Court decision, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=20.78s)]
*  which came down just yesterday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=22.8s)]
*  She joins us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=24.48s)]
*  Mrs. Attorney General, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=25.8s)]
*  thank you for being with us. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=26.6s)]
*  Let's first, if we might together, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=28.16s)]
*  put this in context so that the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=29.92s)]
*  audience understands what happened [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=31.92s)]
*  at the Supreme Court. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=33.32s)]
*  This was an injunction that a lower [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=34.64s)]
*  court ordered that stopped the Biden [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=36.88s)]
*  Administration's rewrite of Title 9, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=39.22s)]
*  which would have expanded sex to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=40.96s)]
*  include gender identity. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=42.800000000000004s)]
*  Is that correct in what was [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=43.84s)]
*  decided by the Supreme Court? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=45.68s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=47.28s)]
*  It's it's a preliminary motion. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=48.0s)]
*  It was the government did not like [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  the fact that we obtained the injunction, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=51.88s)]
*  so they went to the United States [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=54.44s)]
*  Supreme Court decision and they [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=56.94s)]
*  went to the United States Supreme [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=58.92s)]
*  Court to see if they could block it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=60.96s)]
*  Alright, so an injunction stops [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=63.32s)]
*  the rewrite for now of Title 9. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=65.0s)]
*  Let's talk about what the Biden [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=67.16s)]
*  Administration is trying to do to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=69.08s)]
*  Title 9 though they are expanding [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=70.92s)]
*  definitions of for example sex. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  They want to include gender identity. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=74.68s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=77.12s)]
*  Right, and this is not the first time [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=78.8s)]
*  they've tried this is in fact the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=81.08s)]
*  third time they've tried they've. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=83.12s)]
*  They've on two other occasions [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=84.6s)]
*  attempted to do the same thing, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=86.2s)]
*  but they never had actually [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=87.96s)]
*  rewritten the Title 9 rules. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  This is probably the largest effort to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=91.44s)]
*  date to make this particular cultural [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  and policy change. Alright, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=96.55999999999999s)]
*  so a lower court stops it with an injunction. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=98.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court upholds the injunction, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=101.08s)]
*  meaning that will not go into effect. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=103.63999999999999s)]
*  This rewrite of Title 9 won't [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=105.24s)]
*  go into effect for now, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=106.83999999999999s)]
*  but there will be a big case about this. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=108.28s)]
*  What do we say? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=110.72s)]
*  Mr Attorney General to the argument [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=112.0s)]
*  made by the government that the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=114.36s)]
*  the cultural debate we're having [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=117.16s)]
*  about men joining women sports [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  wouldn't be affected by this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=120.96s)]
*  change to Title 9 they are arguing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=122.76s)]
*  This doesn't allow boys to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=125.48s)]
*  jump into girl sports. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=127.32s)]
*  So I think that argument is just ridiculous. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=129.2s)]
*  It would be impossible for them to deny [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=131.72s)]
*  the entire construct that they've [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=134.44s)]
*  recreated for Title 9 and somehow say [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=136.4s)]
*  that wouldn't also apply to locker [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=138.92s)]
*  rooms in girls sports. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=141.04s)]
*  It absolutely does. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=142.4s)]
*  In fact, the current draft of the rule [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=143.48s)]
*  does apply to bathrooms to locker [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=146.08s)]
*  rooms to classrooms to everywhere, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=148.4s)]
*  and so it's a broad broad application [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=150.4s)]
*  right now of the rule and rewrite of the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=152.68s)]
*  rule they didn't use the word athletics [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  in it, but they couldn't really deny [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=157.68s)]
*  that it applies across the board, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=159.8s)]
*  and they certainly couldn't come [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  and carve athletics out without [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=163.36s)]
*  contradicting everything they just did. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  And really quickly before we go, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=166.68s)]
*  would you just and I'm sorry to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=168.56s)]
*  have to ask you do this quickly, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=170.52s)]
*  but I think we take for granted sometimes [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=172.8s)]
*  the full scope of Title 9. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=174.92s)]
*  We know it affects college athletics. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  Title 9 governs how much of you know [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=178.72s)]
*  what we deal with in civil society. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=181.32s)]
*  Well, Title 9 covers the entire [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  educational environment from K through [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=186.16s)]
*  12 and all of higher Ed and graduate [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=188.32s)]
*  schools too, so it's very pervasive [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=191.16s)]
*  and it's been one of the most [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=193.44s)]
*  successful laws that have advanced [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=196.11999999999998s)]
*  women in educational opportunities [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  and athletic opportunities that's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  ever been written, so it's been [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  enormously successful and this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=204.6s)]
*  rewrite eviscerates Title 9 for women. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=206.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean rewriting it now [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=208.16s)]
*  to include gender identity. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=210.04s)]
*  For now it stopped, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=211.36s)]
*  but will be following along as the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=212.56s)]
*  courts hear the actual merits [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=214.68s)]
*  of the case going forward. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=216.32s)]
*  Attorney General Murrell, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrjclFA12k&t=217.96s)]
