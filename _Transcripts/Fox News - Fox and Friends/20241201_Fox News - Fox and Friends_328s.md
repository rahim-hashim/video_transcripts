# Twinkies owner says ‘snacking continues’ despite RFK Jr.’s junk food threats
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI)
*  Well, as Trump and R.F.K. Jr. are ready for a crackdown on ultra-processed foods, the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=0.0s)]
*  maker of Twinkies doesn't appear too concerned. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=6.84s)]
*  Their CEO saying, quote, we believe very strongly that snacking continues. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=10.52s)]
*  Consumers are going to continue to look for a way to reward themselves at different times [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  throughout the day and only acknowledges they could, quote, look at reducing sugar. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=19.04s)]
*  Co-founder of TruMed and the co-author of Good Energy, Callie Means, joins us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=24.84s)]
*  Welcome, Callie. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=30.16s)]
*  Hey, Rachel. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=31.16s)]
*  So much of what you've been fighting for looks like it's about to happen. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=32.16s)]
*  You say that we are on the verge of entering into a golden age for American health. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=36.0s)]
*  I want to first put down, I want you to look at the ingredients that are concerning about [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=41.92s)]
*  Twinkies and then tell me what you think. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=47.08s)]
*  So it's high-fructose corn syrup, yellow 5-dye and red 40-dye. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=49.2s)]
*  Why should we be concerned about those ingredients in Twinkies? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=54.76s)]
*  We should be concerned, Rachel, because those are not ingredients, by and large, that are [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  in Twinkies that are made in any other country. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=63.64s)]
*  I want to be clear. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=68.0s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy is not saying he's going to take the Twinkies away, but we should be starting [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=69.0s)]
*  to ask questions as 77 percent of young adults aren't eligible to join the military in the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=72.88s)]
*  United States due to metabolic health, due to food. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=78.24s)]
*  We have these things called grass standards. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=80.96s)]
*  No other country has them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=82.64s)]
*  Food companies can self-police. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=84.52s)]
*  That's not conservative, it's not liberal. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=86.44s)]
*  It just doesn't make sense. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  We have 10,000 ingredients that aren't allowed in European foods. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=89.04s)]
*  More alarmingly, Rachel, we subsidize this food. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=93.32s)]
*  Again, Twinkies should exist, but I was just on Amazon right before this show. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=96.44s)]
*  They're available for SNAP. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=101.72s)]
*  You can buy them with food stamp dollars right now, Twinkies. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=103.1s)]
*  Additionally, Twinkies actually qualify for federally funded school lunch programs. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=106.48s)]
*  There's no nutrition or sugar limits on federally funded school lunches. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=110.72000000000001s)]
*  The last thing I'll mention, the USDA essentially recommends Twinkies for two-year-olds. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=115.04s)]
*  The USDA right now, our guidelines, which are very corrupt, say that 10 percent of a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=122.36000000000001s)]
*  two-year-old's diet can be added sugar. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  By the letter of the nutrition guidelines, we're actually recommending Twinkies to kids. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=129.88s)]
*  As you said, there's a real optimistic vision here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=135.24s)]
*  I think the food industry is not fully understanding what President Trump and RFK are saying. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=138.04s)]
*  They're saying, let's get all stakeholders together. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=142.76s)]
*  Let's have American food be the most nutritious food in the world and the best food in the world. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=145.12s)]
*  So when you talk about how it's actually recommended to two-year-olds, Twinkies, explain the corruption [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=150.76s)]
*  that happens to get that Twinkie on a list of acceptable foods. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=157.28s)]
*  Because by the way, the ingredients, I put that list of ingredients, they're actually [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=161.92s)]
*  chemicals, right? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=165.2s)]
*  I don't think it should be called Red 40. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  It should be called crude oil. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=170.48s)]
*  That's what Red 40 is. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  It's crude oil with a couple of other molecules. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=174.06s)]
*  Well, let me get into this corruption because as President Trump and RFK have said, the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  first step is to get corruption out of the science. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=181.56s)]
*  So the USDA Nutrition Guidelines Committee, you can't even believe this, but they're able [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=183.64s)]
*  to accept money from food and pharma companies. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=189.04s)]
*  19 out of the 20 advisors on that committee accept money from those industries. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=191.32s)]
*  You can't even make this up, but 30% of President Biden's committee accepted money from GLP-1 [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=196.48s)]
*  makers from a Danish pharmaceutical company, Yovonortix. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=201.64s)]
*  So you have just innate conflicts of interest that infect the USDA Nutrition Guidelines, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=206.2s)]
*  infect our federal school lunch guidelines, infect our SNAP program. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  So before we talk about any policy whatsoever, let's just reconstitute that Nutrition Guidelines [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=215.46s)]
*  Committee and say you cannot accept money from food or pharma companies if you're going [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  to be making recommendations for our kids. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=225.2s)]
*  Yeah, makes sense to me. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=227.39999999999998s)]
*  By the way, this week, Elon Musk and Vivek Rameswamy are going to Capitol Hill. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=228.76s)]
*  They're going to talk about DOGE, this effort, this new agency that's being created to cut [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=232.32s)]
*  down on expenses. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=236.44s)]
*  What could cut down on government expenses more than getting people healthy? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=237.44s)]
*  The number one thing we spend money on is health care. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=242.44s)]
*  Oh, my gosh, I think the connection between Maha and DOGE is a huge opportunity. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk and Vivek Rameswamy have been tweeting about this, actually. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=251.2s)]
*  The biggest part of our budget and the fastest growing part of our budget is health care [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=254.8s)]
*  costs, and that is because we're getting sick. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=258.12s)]
*  It's not the technicalities of policy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=261.48s)]
*  We're the sickest country in the world, and that's what's driving up so much inefficiency. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=263.48s)]
*  So actually making our health care system more efficient, asking how we can spend money [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  more effectively, that's actually asking how we can get healthier. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  So I think this connection between the DOGE effort and Bobby Kennedy's HHS with incredible [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=275.58s)]
*  picks like J Bhattacharya, Marty McCarrie, Jim O'Neill, we can really do a lot. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=280.44s)]
*  And I can tell you there's close collaboration happening between those two organizations. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=286.28s)]
*  Yeah, and Brooke Rollins at Agriculture, which is the other piece of that puzzle. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=290.08s)]
*  So excited for what we're on the verge of this, as you call the golden era, the golden [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=294.76s)]
*  age of health for America. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=299.88s)]
*  You've been on the forefront of this and I'm just happy to see your dreams come true, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=302.0s)]
*  Callie. Let's get it done. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=307.0s)]
*  Rachel, you've been talking about it for a long time and we are on the verge of a golden [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=309.24s)]
*  age here. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=312.6s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=313.6s)]
*  Thanks, Callie. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=314.6s)]
*  Come back. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=315.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onnDtNmiuJI&t=316.6s)]
