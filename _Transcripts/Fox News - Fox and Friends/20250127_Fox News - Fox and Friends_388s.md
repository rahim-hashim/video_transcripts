*  because they do not like President Donald Trump you look at what they're [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=130.24s)]
*  trying to do to Tulsi Gabbard which is disgusting they are trying to say she's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=134.84s)]

*  reservist she's in the military they do not see her as a Russian asset people [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=144.84s)]

*  is they are angry with her because she works in a bipartisan manner and will be [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=154.72000000000003s)]
*  in the cabinet of a Republican president and we're going to keep pushing her [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=162.48s)]
*  through I think too they are very fearful of Cash Patel because Cash Patel knows [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=168.28s)]
*  what Adam Schiff and some of the others did with Russia collusion and they know [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=175.44s)]
*  that he he knows the dirt on them if you will and I think they're fearful of what [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=181.88s)]
*  he's going to do and what he's going to reveal and what he's going to make known [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=187.28s)]
*  to the American people and they recognize that one thing Cash Patel is [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=191.84s)]
*  very devoted to is bringing transparency to what's going on in Washington so true [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=197.0s)]
*  exactly right so to what degree with R.F.K. Junior like Tulsi Gabbard do you [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=204.68s)]
*  think Democrats might hold it against them because I think you're right I think [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=210.68s)]
*  that one of the things that really really enrages them is that these are [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=215.76s)]
*  former Democrats and they feel like they have to I think it just drives them crazy [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=220.04s)]
*  it makes them so mad that these are Democrats who found a way to work on [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=224.96s)]
*  common sense solutions with President Trump. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=229.64s)]
*  You're exactly right about that it does make them angry and so they're wanting to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=234.28s)]
*  punish them and the way they can punish them is to withhold their vote or to slow [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=238.4s)]
*  down their nomination R.F.K. Junior is going to do a great job at HHS and I tell [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOqZ7oQlmE&t=244.4s)]
