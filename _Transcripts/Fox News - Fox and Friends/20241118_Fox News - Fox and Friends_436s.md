# Biden under fire for Ukraine escalation: 'Nobody knows where this is going'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc)
*  In the meantime, another Fox News alert. President Biden attending his final G20 summit in Brazil at any moment. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=0.0s)]
*  Man, look at the beautiful shots of Rio. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=7.58s)]
*  Yeah, this after the president signed off on Ukraine's use of long-range U.S. weapons inside Russia called Atacams. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=9.98s)]
*  Lukas Tomlinson is live from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Hey, Lukas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=16.68s)]
*  Well, good morning, Ainsley. Good morning, guys. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=23.88s)]
*  This is something that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been begging President Biden for for years now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=26.159999999999997s)]
*  And it's notable that specific type of American missile, as you mentioned, Brian, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=31.88s)]
*  the Atacams have been used to strike Crimea in the past, but there were restrictions on using them inside Russia no longer. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=35.2s)]
*  Now, Zelensky had been complaining for a little while now that only 10 percent of the weapons that Congress approved. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=41.96s)]
*  Remember that 60 billion dollar package? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=47.64s)]
*  Only 10 percent of the weapons in that package has arrived into Ukraine. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=49.72s)]
*  Now, speaking of arrival, President Biden arrived here in Rio last night. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=54.44s)]
*  It's notable, guys, there was no red carpet rolled out for his arrivals. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  We're about to see here. Now, China's President Xi Jinping was afforded that honor. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=62.28s)]
*  Biden attended an economic summit in Peru before coming here, where China was given the rare honor of a state visit. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=67.12s)]
*  Biden was not. Brazil is also extending that same honor to Chinese President Xi here in Rio, not Biden. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=72.52s)]
*  Today, Biden will attend meetings here in Rio on global hunger and have a reception with world leaders at an art museum. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  Putin is not here, of course. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=85.08000000000001s)]
*  Now, officials say Biden has signed off on this limited counterstrike allowing Ukraine to use American missiles with a range of up to 90 miles, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=86.72s)]
*  a common single warhead and also cluster munitions. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=93.76s)]
*  The goal is to hit North Korean soldiers that deployed to Russia, specifically the Kursk region and only this area inside Russia where Ukraine launched its incursion back in August. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=96.2s)]
*  Now, Ukraine is forbidden, Brian, to use these missiles, American missiles elsewhere. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=105.92s)]
*  Biden's decision to use these long range missiles comes one day after Russia launched one of its largest attacks on Ukraine since the start of this war, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=110.72s)]
*  firing over 200 missiles and drones, these drones from Ukraine, of course, targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure, where winter has already arrived. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  Now, yesterday, Biden became the first sitting president to visit the Amazon. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=126.24s)]
*  I'm proud to be here, the first sitting U.S. president to visit the Amazon rainforest. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=131.84s)]
*  History is literally watching us now. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=136.88000000000002s)]
*  So let's preserve this secret place for our time and forever for the benefit of all humanity. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  After losing the 1912 election, Theodore Roosevelt made an ill fated trip along the Amazon, almost killed him. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  Now, pretty soon, going back to Ukraine, you could have American weapons being fired by Ukraine to kill North Korean soldiers inside Russia, guys. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=154.76s)]
*  And Lucas, there's a story out. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=163.0s)]
*  Bloomberg's got a story this morning that North Korea, we know they've sent at least 3000 troops to help Russia. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=164.56s)]
*  Bloomberg says there's a possibility they could send up to 100000. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=172.12s)]
*  That's right, Steve. That's the big concern here. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=179.16s)]
*  Of course, President Biden met with South Korea's president in Peru. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=181.04s)]
*  The South Korean president's already on the ground here in Rio as well. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=185.72s)]
*  This has certainly been concerning for South Korea and certainly for the president. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=188.56s)]
*  It was very clear when we spoke to Deputy National Security Advisor John Finer that the deployment of these North Korean forces could be up to 100000 inside Russia. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=192.56s)]
*  That was the game changer. And that's what changed the White House and President Biden's calculus. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=201.84s)]
*  Lucas, I think it has a lot to do with who won the election, too, because he does not. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=206.32s)]
*  He only has two months to put his agenda forward. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=210.4s)]
*  But thanks so much. The Atacams go 190 miles an hour. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=213.68s)]
*  There's no question, Brad. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=217.12s)]
*  Yep. Three hundred seventy five pounds of explosives. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  It'll be big, but we need our allies to do the same thing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  They're waiting for our go ahead to lift restrictions. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  But now the UK, Germany, everybody's got to go in there because you put 100000 men into that fight to a country that has lost about 700000. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  The estimates are Russia lost 700000 off the battlefield, 250000 dead. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=237.56s)]
*  It's a stunning number, but they don't care about their people. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=242.44s)]
*  They put in the poor, the one without influence, and they basically tell them now you got to go. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=245.4s)]
*  And according to General Keene, they're out of incentive. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=250.72s)]
*  They're out of money. They were paying them extraordinary amount of money. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=253.12s)]
*  So if your kid died in the fight, you would get some money. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  Now, all of a sudden, they're they're drying up there. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=258.56s)]
*  So how do you how do you know how many are killed since you can't really trust if that's the number they give? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=261.12s)]
*  You got to figure it's probably a lot bigger than I mean, they're rough estimates, but they don't Russians don't push back on it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=266.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, you know, so we're at a point where everybody would love a ceasefire or an end to it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=271.92s)]
*  But what type of leverage do you have when Trump gets in and talks if right now they're taking land and they're holding on to a little bit of Russian land? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=277.92s)]
*  But if they could get on the offensive and when Putin comes to the table, when Trump takes over, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=287.64000000000004s)]
*  then Zolensky has a better chance of holding on to more of his property. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=292.68s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump ran on wrapping it up as quickly as he can. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=296.76s)]
*  So I don't think he really cares what the Biden administration does, because on day one, he's going to do stuff his way. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  His national security adviser in doing a deal, he wants to Lensky to have as much leverage as possible because Putin is going to be less apt to do a deal. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  If he feels his own momentum and everything else is on his side, they won't talk until after the inauguration. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=316.12s)]
*  I've heard contours of what he's talking about with both Putin and Zolensky, and it sounds like ultimatums to both of them. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=321.12s)]
*  So it's like, OK, let's wrap this up, which means less fighting. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=329.52s)]
*  Anyway, Brian talked to Michael Waltz, this current congressman from the great state of Florida. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=333.6s)]
*  He is the president's pick for NSA. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=340.08s)]
*  And he had this observation about how Russia is escalating, which is not good for anybody. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  It's another step up the escalation ladder, and nobody knows where this is going. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  North Korea is unleashing ballistic missiles, artillery, now tens of thousands of soldiers. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=355.24s)]
*  The administration responds by lifting this restriction. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=361.72s)]
*  North Korea sends more soldiers. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=365.12s)]
*  South Korea is now saying it may get engaged. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  China is buying oil from Iran for pennies of the dollar. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=371.64000000000004s)]
*  Iran is using that to send missiles and drones to Russia. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=375.64000000000004s)]
*  That is then hitting Ukrainian critical infrastructure. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=379.76000000000005s)]
*  So this is a development, but it's a tactical one. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=382.12s)]
*  President Trump is talking grand strategy here. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=385.76000000000005s)]
*  How do we get both sides to the table to end this war? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  What's the framework for a deal? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  And who's sitting at that table? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=394.88000000000005s)]
*  This is an all-star team, Brian, that President Trump is assembling that will think through these broader strategic issues. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=397.36s)]
*  And how do we drive this war to an end, as President Trump promised on the campaign trail? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=409.76s)]
*  There'll be a lot of effect, because I know denying Iran will stop them from replenishing [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=410.76s)]
*  to a degree Russia. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  That could help. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  And then you have leverage over China if we stop allowing Iran to sell cheap oil to China. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  So it's going to be a new sheriff in town. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=423.72s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qvVR6colzc&t=425.84000000000003s)]
