# Democrat operative leaves party after DNC: 'Can't stand it anymore'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps)
*  So our next guest a Democratic campaign operative who is leaving the party says she worked to raise millions for the Democratic Party [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=0.0s)]
*  Only to realize the hypocrisy the other party of the rich Evan Barker joins us now Evan [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=6.96s)]
*  I got to tell you I'm so fascinated by you because I was once a Democrat as well knocked on doors [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=12.76s)]
*  It was really my party and then something happened [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  I'm curious. What was the main thing that caused you to just say I'm done [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  There was a lot of things to be honest [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=26.7s)]
*  I just want to say it is so crazy that I'm even speaking to you if somebody had told me a month ago that I was going to be talking to Fox News [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=29.06s)]
*  Who I've been told is the enemy [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=36.06s)]
*  I would never have believed it [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=39.06s)]
*  But basically yeah, I've worked in Democratic politics a long time [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=42.06s)]
*  I've raised the millions of dollars and I went to the DNC last month hoping to feel re-inspired and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=46.06s)]
*  Instead I just felt like I was in a room with the most out-of-touch and elite people in the world and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=52.86s)]
*  You know, I'm originally from the Midwest a lot of the people in my family are [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=59.1s)]
*  Union workers or have been in unions and they are people who once voted for Barack Obama [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=64.74s)]
*  And now they vote for Donald Trump and for a long time. I did not understand why and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=71.62s)]
*  After raising money for Democrats and just being in these circles [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=79.02s)]
*  I have realized that the donors control the party [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=83.86s)]
*  They control everything they control [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=89.06s)]
*  What the candidates prioritize and I know that Republicans also have this issue too [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=92.98s)]
*  But Democrats are much bigger hypocrites about it [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=99.1s)]
*  And so I think what it comes down to is just [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=101.86s)]
*  The fact that I don't recognize this party anymore [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=105.54s)]
*  You know, they have become the party of Dick Cheney of Goldman Sachs of endless proxy boards [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=108.54s)]
*  Of identity politics, you know, and I'm just at a point [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=116.02s)]
*  you know, I've been very brave the last couple of weeks and I've gotten a lot of flack from a lot of people and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=119.58s)]
*  I'm just at the point where I can't stand it anymore and I have to speak out. So that's why I'm here [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=125.18s)]
*  You know Evan, we're happy to have you on Fox News and I'm so happy to be here with you [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=129.3s)]
*  You know Evan we're happy to have you on Fox News and look [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=132.54s)]
*  15 year old Lawrence Jones probably wouldn't have been on Fox News as well. But here I am [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=135.82s)]
*  You see things check differently you grow up. So let me ask you this Evan [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=139.9s)]
*  What happened to the party because one thing I found out is about the working class [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=145.42s)]
*  It doesn't seem like they're even concerned about you know, the prices when people go to the grocery store. I [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=149.98s)]
*  Know and this this clip that you that you guys just played with Oprah and like all these celebrities zooming in from their mansions [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=157.22s)]
*  I mean, they're just telling us basically that all we need to have is optimism and joy and that's gonna fix our lives [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  And I'm just tired of it. I'm completely fed up [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  You know my grandmother she lives in Missouri. She voted for Obama twice [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=175.82s)]
*  She's voted for Trump the last couple of times, you know, she's getting by just on her Social Security check right now [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=179.78s)]
*  You know and things have gotten so outrageously expensive. It is so difficult for her [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=186.42s)]
*  You know, I want to see the Democratic Party talk about what they're going to do for my grandmother [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=191.94s)]
*  Not just have a bunch of celebrities fly in and tell us all to be joyful and optimistic. It's cringy [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=197.42s)]
*  It's embarrassing. It is well Evan we're happy to have you and I tell you what I want you to come back as you continue this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592bKX3sUps&t=204.57999999999998s)]
