# Kevin O'Leary: It's time to set the record straight
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58)
*  Mexico calling Trump to propose 25% tariff on their goods unacceptable and threatened [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=0.0s)]
*  to impose their own on the US in return. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  It is not acceptable and would cause the US and Mexico inflation and job losses. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=13.48s)]
*  70% of the illegal weapons seized from criminals in Mexico come from your country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=18.32s)]
*  The weapons are not produced by us. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=23.82s)]
*  The synthetic drugs are not consumed by us. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=26.060000000000002s)]
*  Okay, but here in the US Trump appeared to double down by tapping Jamison Greer for US [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=28.96s)]
*  trade representative, a key player in China trade negotiations in Trump's first term. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=35.08s)]
*  Shark Tank investor and O'Leary Ventures Chairman Kevin O'Leary, Mr. Wonderful himself joins [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=40.16s)]
*  us now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=45.64s)]
*  So tell me this Kevin, I'm not concerned about Canada or Mexico. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=47.14s)]
*  They're going to fold. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=52.64s)]
*  They need the money. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=53.64s)]
*  They don't want to get into a war with us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=54.64s)]
*  But with China, how does that play out with the UF tariff policy? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=56.12s)]
*  Because it's the threat of the tariff, right? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=60.88s)]
*  Yeah, China has not played by the rules since they came into WTO in 1999 and most administrations [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=64.28s)]
*  have just let it roll. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  Most of us who do business there realize it's time to really set the record straight here [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=72.64s)]
*  because they cheat, they steal, they don't protect IP, we can't use their courts. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=76.56s)]
*  And Chi is getting away with it because he thinks no one will stand up to it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  My strategy here and what I would advocate for is to raise the wall so high that it forces [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=85.84s)]
*  him to the table here in Washington for a reciprocal deal which we desperately need. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=91.54s)]
*  It's not 25%, it's 400%. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=96.4s)]
*  You basically threaten to bankrupt his economy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=99.2s)]
*  And the only reason Chi gets to be the Supreme Leader is people are employed. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=102.04s)]
*  If you threaten the core of his economy by shutting down access to the world's largest [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=106.54s)]
*  economy- [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  People rise up. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  They rise up, they throw him out. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  When he senses that coming, he'll fly to Washington to cut a deal. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=113.96s)]
*  It's going to take very tough negotiations but I'm happy to see this is going on. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  Mexico and Canada, different deal, we have a new trade agreement. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=123.0s)]
*  The challenge for- Mexico has a brand new leader so you see she's feisty, she's making [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=125.56s)]
*  her moves, that makes sense. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=129.92s)]
*  Canada's a different situation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=132.2s)]
*  Trudeau's on his way out. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=134.64s)]
*  He's at the end of a long mandate. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=135.72s)]
*  In the parliamentary system when you can't win a majority mandate, they throw you out, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=137.92s)]
*  that's happening to him now. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=141.2s)]
*  The new Prime Minister most likely is Pierre-Paul Levy. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=142.8s)]
*  We love him. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  Well he's going to be negotiating this deal so I would advise Trump's team to bring him [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  down to Mar-a-Lago and meet him now because he's already told the Canadian people he's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  going to do, get rid of carbon taxes, lift the ban on pipelines, be pro-business. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  That's in sync with Trump's mandate. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=161.96s)]
*  So I think there's going to be a great relationship in Canada and the US over the next decade. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=164.18s)]
*  So let's talk about that mandate. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  You see the country right now. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  People are so excited right now. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=171.04s)]
*  You got people coming out of the woodworks. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  You didn't even know they were Trump supporters and now I'm seeing MAGA hats in New York [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  City but there's this overall optimism that we're back, we're going to fight, there's [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=177.76s)]
*  deals being done on the world stage. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=182.32s)]
*  Are you feeling that in the financial community as well? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=184.83999999999997s)]
*  Not only in large cap companies with CEOs that have to hedge their bets and say they're [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=188.27999999999997s)]
*  playing both sides, but 62% of this economy, small businesses in America, 5 to 500 family [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  businesses, they're loving what they see. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=197.88s)]
*  Less regulation, stabilized taxes, the ability to now that this uncertainty is over with [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=201.0s)]
*  make their decisions. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=206.64s)]
*  I just flew in from West Virginia. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=208.4s)]
*  We just cracked ground on a $35 million new plant that we were hedging on waiting to see [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=210.22s)]
*  what would happen. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=214.68s)]
*  Now that we know the regulatory environment is going to be stripped away federally, we're [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=215.78s)]
*  putting money in the ground. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=219.24s)]
*  We're going to create 100 jobs there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=220.24s)]
*  This is what I love. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=221.88s)]
*  This is what I love about stability. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=223.0s)]
*  This is always better because it lets you pursue what matters in America. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  The number one export we have is the American dream. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  We've got to support the American dream. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=232.72s)]
*  That's the whole idea. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=234.76s)]
*  The American dream is when businesses can create jobs and families flourish. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l--k-l_y58&t=235.76s)]
