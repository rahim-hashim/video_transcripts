# Schumer reportedly directed Dems to pressure Trump nominees: 'SHAMEFUL'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4)
*  So this morning, Senate confirmation here is for President-elect Trump's cabinet begins. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=0.0s)]
*  And up first is Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hexa. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=4.32s)]
*  In his opening statement attained by Axios, Pete will say, quote, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=8.08s)]
*  It is true I don't have a similar biography to defense secretaries of the last 30 years. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=12.16s)]
*  But as President Trump also told me, we've repeatedly placed people on top of the Pentagon [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=17.2s)]
*  with supposedly the right credentials, whether they are retired generals, academic or defense [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=22.88s)]
*  contractor executives. And where has that gotten us? He believes, and I humbly agree, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=28.16s)]
*  that it's time to give someone with dust on his boots to him, a change agent. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=33.76s)]
*  Newly elected Senator Jim Banks sits on the Senate Armed Service Committee and will be a part [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  of that hearing this morning. Senator, congratulations on your win and thank you [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=45.44s)]
*  for joining the program this morning. So Pete talks about being a change agent. He talks about [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=50.32s)]
*  the agenda of the president. Of course, he's written books about this, been champions for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=56.4s)]
*  years. But the Democrats on the committee, they're not going to make it about the issues, right? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=61.68s)]
*  That's right, Lawrence. I just got to Capitol Hill. I walked into the Senate office buildings [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=68.88s)]
*  and there are hundreds of veterans already lined up to come to Capitol Hill today to show their [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=74.48s)]
*  support for Pete Hexa. Many of them are wearing veterans for Pete t-shirts to show their public [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=80.0s)]
*  support. And a lot of them will be in the room today because Pete is Pete will be the first [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=86.08s)]
*  secretary of defense from my generation, the post 9 11 generation of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=90.72s)]
*  He served in both places. I served in Afghanistan, so I appreciate his service immensely as two [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=97.2s)]
*  bronze stars. And President Trump is right. We need a change agent at the Pentagon to clean up [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=103.12s)]
*  the mess of the last four years. But the Democrats, they're focused on all of the crazy stuff. They're [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=109.12s)]
*  doing what Democrats do. They're attacking Pete for being a Christian, for having a Christian tattoo, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=114.48s)]
*  by the way, the same symbol that was on the cover of the program at the Jimmy Carter funeral [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=119.92s)]
*  last week. And they called him an insider threat for having the same symbol as a tattoo. It's crazy [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=125.2s)]
*  stuff, anonymous sources, but he's going to do well today. I've met with him. I've been in some [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  of the practice meetings with him. He's ready to go. He's going to knock it out of the park. He's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=137.04s)]
*  going to be the first cabinet secretary that we confirm after January 20th. He's going to be great [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=142.0s)]
*  at the job. Senator, your colleague Chuck Schumer has a plan and this is what Axios has learned. He [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=146.88s)]
*  said Republicans spent four years attacking the Democratic brand and we need to use the hearing to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=154.08s)]
*  begin to return the favor Schumer told Democrats in a private meeting early January. So again, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=158.96s)]
*  this is about retribution. This is not about is he qualified for the job? Yeah, it's shameful. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=166.96s)]
*  This is the most important cabinet secretary that President Trump will have on his team [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=176.0s)]
*  at the Department of Defense to make our military lethal again, to get our military back focused on [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=180.8s)]
*  what it has to be focused on. This is a dangerous time in American history and Pete Hegseth is going [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  to get the military back instead of focusing on all the woke political crap that the Biden [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=191.84s)]
*  administration and Lloyd Austin and all of these the clown show at the Pentagon over the last four [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=196.32s)]
*  years. They were more focused on wokeness than readiness and right now we have a significant [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=201.2s)]
*  recruitment crisis because of it. The army has the army decreased their standards. The Navy is way [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=206.72s)]
*  off of their recruitment targets and a lot of it has to has to do with wokeness but a lot of it has [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=214.8s)]
*  to do with what happened in Afghanistan too. We can't forget that we need someone like Pete to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=220.08s)]
*  clean up the mess, make the military strong again, fix those issues. He's the guy for the job. Well, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=224.56s)]
*  Senator today is the first day of change because I have a prediction. I think he's going to get [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=229.84s)]
*  through the committee. I think he's going to kill it today and I think he will be our next defense [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=233.68s)]
*  secretary and it's because of the men and women that are there today. They finally got a fighter [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=238.0s)]
*  not only in the White House but a fighter at the Pentagon and that is something we should all be [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  celebrating. Senator Banks, thanks so much for joining the program. Thank you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD5B4aUyA4&t=248.96s)]
