# Expert questions medical jet’s maintenance after Philly crash
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E)
*  Fox News alert, terrifying video capturing the moment a medical plane carrying six people, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=0.0s)]
*  including a child patient who had just been released from Shriners Hospital in Philadelphia, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=6.18s)]
*  plummeting from the sky last night. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=11.22s)]
*  The plane crashed into a Philadelphia mall, spraying jet fuel across the area, leaving [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=13.52s)]
*  homes burning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=18.14s)]
*  Here to discuss is former NTSB investigator and former Learjet pilot Alan Deal. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=19.88s)]
*  Thanks for joining us, Mr. Deal. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  So when, you know, obviously we have seen all of this pretty dramatic video of the plane [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=27.12s)]
*  crashing. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=32.2s)]
*  What do you see as a pilot that maybe the rest of us don't necessarily understand about [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=33.84s)]
*  from watching these videos? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=42.38s)]
*  Well, obviously the most impressive thing, scariest thing is the angle that it descended [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=44.32s)]
*  at. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=52.64s)]
*  We've seen this in another Learjet accident in Mexico. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=53.72s)]
*  By the way, this was a Mexican registered Learjet, as you probably know. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  And I know the NTSB will be looking at the maintenance history as best they can with [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  the Mexican authorities on this particular aircraft. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=67.68s)]
*  But perhaps the stabilator, the tail, of course, controls the pitch angle, the nose up down. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  If that failed or ran away, you could get this kind of descent. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=77.36s)]
*  I guess theoretically you could also had an engine explode. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=82.48s)]
*  And I can't tell if it's on fire on the way down or not. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  Some people think it was. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=89.58s)]
*  But that portends probably some kind of catastrophic engine failure. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=91.17999999999999s)]
*  But again, that's what the NTSB will have to establish. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=96.16s)]
*  It's going to be difficult because of the condition of the wreckage. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=100.68s)]
*  So when you say it was a Mexican registered Learjet, does that mean that the jet would [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=104.2s)]
*  have been on an inspection regime as prescribed by Mexican regulators as opposed to U.S. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=110.32s)]
*  regulators? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=118.32s)]
*  Because my understanding is that most of these Learjets in the United States, anyway, are [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=119.32s)]
*  pretty heavily inspected equipment. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they're supposed to follow the manufacturer's directives on maintenance and so on. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  But the one Learjet investigation, it was an American Learjet flown in Mexico. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=132.6s)]
*  And we found out that the plane wasn't properly maintained. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=140.24s)]
*  They may not have as good of surveillance in Mexico. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=143.72s)]
*  I'm not saying this aircraft was defective and it's the responsibility of the Mexican authorities. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=147.4s)]
*  I'm simply saying in that other case, it was one that killed Jenny Rivera. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  That Learjet also fell out of the sky. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=158.68s)]
*  And when I looked at the maintenance records, I just shook my head saying, oh, boy, this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=162.0s)]
*  surveillance was not very good. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=169.0s)]
*  And in that case, the crew was not properly qualified either. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=171.0s)]
*  But I'm not saying this is the case now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  That's what the NTSB will have to sort out in future weeks and months. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=177.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=182.16s)]
*  So obviously this comes on the heels of another tragedy in Washington, D.C., between the American [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=183.16s)]
*  Airlines commercial flight and the Black Hawk helicopter. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=189.32s)]
*  NTSB officials have recovered the black boxes there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=193.32s)]
*  What are they going to be looking for in the black box there? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think the critical thing will be the Black Hawk black box and particularly the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=203.38s)]
*  voice. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=208.9s)]
*  It has both voice and data, I understand. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=209.9s)]
*  Looks like it's in good shape. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=211.78s)]
*  And one of the theories, and I don't want to start any speculation here, but I'll mention [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=213.7s)]
*  I've flown with night vision goggles when I did military crash investigations. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=219.18s)]
*  And if you are wearing night vision goggles and a bright light hits you, all of a sudden [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=225.22s)]
*  you go blind momentarily. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=231.82s)]
*  Now, remember, both the president and the secretary of defense have said there was an [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=233.54s)]
*  elevation problem, an altitude problem. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=238.22s)]
*  She's not allowed to get over 200 feet. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=241.26s)]
*  She's being supervised. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  And I don't think there's any way that they would intentionally climb that helicopter [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=245.1s)]
*  up to the reported altitude of 350. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=249.78s)]
*  Now, that data comes from not from the NTSB, but from both Trump and from the secretary [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=252.66s)]
*  of defense. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=260.5s)]
*  So if somehow a bright light, if they had the NVGs down, and that's what this voice [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=261.5s)]
*  recorder should uncover, and they were hit by a bright light, like perhaps the landing [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=267.98s)]
*  lights on the airliner, they would be momentarily blind. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=274.06s)]
*  And they might, I'm a psychologist. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=278.98s)]
*  This is what they call a startle response. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=281.1s)]
*  And if she's got her hands on the two controls, it's quite possible. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=282.86s)]
*  This is what the NTSB has got to sort out. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  So short answer is those recorders are going to be critical, but particularly the Blackhawk [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=290.94s)]
*  recorder and the voice segment therein, Charlie. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=296.86s)]
*  Well, it's all very helpful. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=302.18s)]
*  Very much appreciate you joining us, Alan Deal. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=303.78s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrrL-Lgx8E&t=307.82s)]
