# Critics notice something about Kamala rallies: 'What a robot!'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk)
*  Trump holds on an hour-long press conference yesterday at least while Vice President Harris took questions from reporters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=0.0s)]
*  For 60 seconds after dodging the press for 18 days. Aisha Heisenly was at that press conference [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=6.8s)]
*  She had the opportunity to ask the former president some questions and she's live at Palm Beach right now. Hey Aisha. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  I should have asked him if he plays the clarinet [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=20.52s)]
*  I think the race would be over if we could just figure out if one of them... One of them plays the clarinet, it's over [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=22.52s)]
*  Yeah, so look Trump in this press conference guys was trying to prove that he is the most [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=28.68s)]
*  Transparent candidate that he is the most accessible candidate trying to paint the split screen [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=35.04s)]
*  With him and Kamala Harris and really trying to put this pressure campaign on her to face the cameras because he believes that that is [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=39.64s)]
*  Her number one weakness. I think a campaign official yesterday told me that Biden's weakness was walking hers is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=46.4s)]
*  Talking so that is the strategy here trying to get her to face the cameras [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=54.2s)]
*  He also yesterday addressed reporting that he's been frustrated with his campaign as new polling shows that Harris has taken a small lead [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=58.44s)]
*  But the Trump team is calling that a honeymoon period that will go away as soon as she opens her mouth [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=65.68s)]
*  She's not doing any news conference, you know why she's not doing because she can't do a news conference [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=73.0s)]
*  She doesn't know how to do a news conference. She's not smart enough to do a news conference [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  So the pressure campaign it seems to be working Harris has now agreed to the first presidential debate moderated by ABC on September 10th [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=80.56s)]
*  And she finally spoke to reporters us on the tarmac in Michigan shortly after Trump's press conference [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=88.56s)]
*  Glad that he's finally agreed to a debate. I'm looking forward to it and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=97.56s)]
*  Hope he shows up. Are you open to more debate? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=101.56s)]
*  Hope he shows up. Are you open to more debate? I am happy to have that conversation about an additional debate for after September 10th [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=103.56s)]
*  When you're gonna sit down for your first interview since being the nominee I talked to my team [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=110.56s)]
*  I want us to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=116.56s)]
*  Okay, so we'll wait to see if that actually happens because Politico is reporting that according to two people familiar with the campaign's thinking [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=120.56s)]
*  This is the Harris campaign's thinking there are ongoing discussions right now about doing a joint interview with Harris and walls her running mate prior to the convention [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=127.56s)]
*  Which of course begins in about a week in Chicago [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=135.56s)]
*  But other staffers have also told that news organization that they may actually want to stall until after Labor Day weekend because they don't really feel that it's very necessary to do a national interview when she can just get on the ground and engage with voters directly in these swathes [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=139.56s)]
*  Is there any frustration amongst the press corps? I mean they were aggressive against Joe Biden after the debate and you saw a lot of reporting there talking about his stability what's going on behind the scenes [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=156.56s)]
*  But it looks like they pulled back a little bit so I'm just curious what are you hearing? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=168.56s)]
*  There's always frustration Lawrence when we can't get answers or can't even ask a question but I think that's why you notice that that pool reporter on the tarmac is not as aggressive as the press corps [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=174.56s)]
*  That was I think the second or third question right after getting to the debate [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=185.56s)]
*  The immediate question after was wasn't about policy wasn't about the economy wasn't about Trump it was when are you going to talk to us? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=190.56s)]
*  When are you going to have this first interview? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=197.56s)]
*  And that tells you everything. Yeah, I should thanks and by the way that's an insult to the American people because the media is asking the questions [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=200.56s)]
*  The media is asking the questions extensively that the people out there the voters out there want asked. So when you blow off the press you might say oh I blew off Fox or CNN or MSNBC [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=208.56s)]
*  What you're doing is you're telling the American people you don't need to know we'll handle it you don't need to know and that's we have President Biden right now on the beach in Rehoboth while we have tenuous [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=218.56s)]
*  The Middle East is a tender bias and we have a lot of explanations on what the feds going to be doing and what's happening with the economy [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=228.56s)]
*  They feel like they don't have to talk to the American people. They've made a calculation they've decided the risk of her messing up in this final hour [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=235.56s)]
*  Remember nobody gets a chance to become president with no primary and only 90 days you know they're like trying to run out the clock so the risk to them is too high [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=243.56s)]
*  But the risk to the voters of putting somebody as the CEO of this country without having asked him any policy question remember on this thing she's saying what you know why won't you what do you think of Trump policies [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=252.56s)]
*  I'll tell you exactly what you say the same thing over and over again listen to this. It really is good to be back in Wisconsin. It is so good to be back in Michigan. Listen let me tell you I am clear the path to the White House runs right through this state [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=265.56s)]
*  And listen I am clear the path to the White House runs right through this state. I took on perpetrators of all kinds. I took on perpetrators of all kinds and had a summer job at McDonald's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=280.56s)]
*  I had a summer job at McDonald's. So hear me when I say so hear me Detroit when I say I know Donald Trump's type. I know Donald Trump's type. And are we ready to fight for it. And are we ready to fight for it. And when we fight we win. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=295.56s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=322.56s)]
*  What a robot. What a robot. There is no ad lib. She is just keeping to this group. You're telling me that I may have disagreed with President Barack Obama but the dude could speak. He could go out there rally a crowd together and they're competing her to form a president Barack Obama come on. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=325.56s)]
*  No one is buying this. Another thing that they're doing is okay she's not talking to the public. She's doing these canned speeches over and over. That means her first big moment is going to be giving an acceptance speech at the DNC. If she doesn't crush it it's over for her. It's over. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=344.56s)]
*  She can do a speech. She can do a speech. She can't deliver that speech at the DNC. She can't deliver it but she's going to have a teleprompter. Remember Lawrence this is the TTV campaign. Teleprompter, Tik Tok and the View. That is all they're going to do and she's going to deliver a teleprompter speech. It will be good. It will be written by other people. She'll be fine. The question is can she speak extemporaneously. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=360.56s)]
*  Right. Can she sit down with you haven't been to the border. Can she do the follow up question and just say the 12 things that you used to believe that she doesn't believe. Why don't you believe it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=387.56s)]
*  Sure. Because when she sat down with Lester Holt last year that was a disaster. And I'm sure the people in the campaign are thinking you know the risk. It's all about risk and reward. The reward is great if she goes out and does a good job. The risk is she becomes Katie Couric interviews Sarah Palin. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=397.56s)]
*  And that was a disaster. That just pretty much Sarah Palin was doing doing pretty well until that interview and then it was just right in the gutter. And the debate. Well we know one debate the president will have a shot to unmask or find out where the depth is. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=415.56s)]
*  Well we know what happened during her last debate and it didn't go so well. A couple of them did though. Early on she did OK with seven people on the stage. When she took him out. When it came exact and then Tulsi took her out. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=428.56s)]
*  We'll be right back with more of the latest on the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in the latest in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wQau83ILNk&t=445.56s)]
