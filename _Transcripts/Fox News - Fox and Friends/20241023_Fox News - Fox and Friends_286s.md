# McEnany torches The Atlantic: 'This is shameful reporting'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4)
*  Go ahead. Bring us to probably the most controversial thing this happened over the last 24 hours. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=0.0s)]
*  Arguably the October surprise that John Kelly and General Mattis are authoring. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=4.0s)]
*  Yeah, so this I heard this overnight. This is the Atlantic. It's Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=9.0s)]
*  And here's the headlines from the Atlantic. Trump. I need the kind of generals that Hitler had. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=13.0s)]
*  And you can see the subtitle there. The Republican nominees preoccupation with dictators. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=18.0s)]
*  And it goes on. When I saw this first, they talk about a meeting with the Guyon family. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=23.0s)]
*  The Guyon family tragically lost their sister, lost their daughter. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=28.0s)]
*  She served our country honorably and they characterize a meeting, one in which I was in. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=33.0s)]
*  I was not in this December meeting they speak of, but a meeting with this family. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=39.0s)]
*  And here's what the sister said about this story. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=43.0s)]
*  Wow, I don't appreciate how you all are exploiting my sister's death for politics. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=46.0s)]
*  Hurtful, deceitful, the important changes she made for service members. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=50.0s)]
*  Indeed, she did. President Donald Trump did nothing but show respect to my family and Vanessa. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=54.0s)]
*  I was in that July meeting. That was undoubtedly the case. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=58.0s)]
*  But the reason my antennas went up last night when I saw the name Jeffrey Goldberg is because I was on a tarmac in September of 2020. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=61.0s)]
*  And a story popped from him in the Atlantic and it was the suckers and losers story we have all heard. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=68.0s)]
*  Within hours, I was able to collect more than a dozen individuals, several who were firsthand sources saying that never happened. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=73.0s)]
*  Zach Fuentes, who was an aide of John Kelly, came out and said that never happened. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=81.0s)]
*  We found contemporaneous documents disputing the reporter who said Trump did not go to the cemetery not because of a bad weather call. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=86.0s)]
*  John Bolton's book disputes that. We found a contemporaneous document to dispute that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=92.0s)]
*  My point is this is based on four anonymous sources two weeks before an election disputed by people on the record. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=96.0s)]
*  And yet it led a CBS News broadcast. What a shame. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=103.0s)]
*  Did they include your portion? Did they include? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=106.0s)]
*  No, they never reached out to me. I was in that first meeting. Never reached out to me. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=108.0s)]
*  But I will say this quickly. Donald Trump. I've never seen him more downtrodden than when the suckers and losers story came out. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=111.0s)]
*  He normally stuff came out of it's about his finances, fake stories. He didn't care. He was devastated by that story. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=118.0s)]
*  I remember him saying what kind of monster would ever say words like that. This is shameful reporting from the Atlantic. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=124.0s)]
*  Well, in my opinion, to the former president's point as well, he said when asked about this, he goes, just think about this logically. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=129.0s)]
*  He goes, I'm in a cemetery surrounded by generals. He goes, why would I? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=136.0s)]
*  Why would I say he said whatever would deck me in the face over something like this? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=141.0s)]
*  He goes, why would I say something? It just logically does not make sense to say that comment in the cemetery surrounded by generals. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=145.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=153.0s)]
*  The opinion on this, I saw this coming. You know I've said this for about for about a year. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=154.0s)]
*  Yeah, you did call this. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=159.0s)]
*  So I read H.R. McMaster's book. I thought that was going to be it. I find him unbelievably insightful and smart. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=160.0s)]
*  I read his book. You know what he did as a national security advisor? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=165.0s)]
*  He spent the whole time dealing with Mattis and Kelly, who I also like and have huge respect for, who didn't like the president, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=168.0s)]
*  thought he was incompetent and not capable of doing the job. And they thought it was their job to rein him in. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=175.0s)]
*  McMaster said, even though he's a three star, telling four stars and said, we're civilians now, that's not your job. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=180.0s)]
*  Your job is not to rein in the president. Your job is to give him the best advice possible and do what he said. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=188.0s)]
*  Play this out. So if your general, who's your chief of staff and your secretary of defense, is not doing what you say on an everyday basis, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=193.0s)]
*  he's like, you know, I'd love I could see him going. I love generals that listened. That would be great. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=201.0s)]
*  And he's also from a world where his company is huge, but it's a family company. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=206.0s)]
*  So when he asked Eric or somebody to do something, they do it. It's not even publicly traded. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=211.0s)]
*  He doesn't have board members. All of a sudden now he's like, do this. What do you mean you can't do it? Do this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=216.0s)]
*  What do you mean you can't do it? What do you mean I'm not allowed to do it? And after a while, while being investigated, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=220.0s)]
*  there were probably times we topped up. Wouldn't it be great if generals actually listened? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=225.0s)]
*  Can you imagine if some people listen to the commander chief? I could absolutely see that happening. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=229.0s)]
*  And why? And they know it in context. But they said he could win. I'm going to stop him. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=234.0s)]
*  And so the Atlantic is getting a lot of publicity for this particular article, you know, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=240.0s)]
*  and it's getting a lot of publicity because of the Hitler comment, which the Trump campaign says he never said that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=246.0s)]
*  And also the cost of the funeral, because during the meeting you were at with the family of Vanessa Guillen, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=251.0s)]
*  he said, how much is it going to cost? You know, and her lawyer said the family lawyer said, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=258.0s)]
*  well, the military is going to take care of it. And he said, well, if there's a problem, let me know. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=263.0s)]
*  I will financially pay for it. And they said the things that he said afterwards never happened as well. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=268.0s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilme. And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TtUcyazIz4&t=274.0s)]
