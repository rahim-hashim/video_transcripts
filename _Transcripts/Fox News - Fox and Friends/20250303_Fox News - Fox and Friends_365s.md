# Rubio takes on ABC host: It's only bad when Trump does this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs)
*  There wasn't good vibes with Zelensky and our president and vice president. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=0.0s)]
*  No, we watched it all unfold on national television Friday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=4.0s)]
*  Normally we get a readout on this, but this time we saw it all before our eyes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=6.76s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=11.56s)]
*  Slightly delayed. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=12.56s)]
*  If you were watching Outnumbered, you saw the live playback of the video. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=13.56s)]
*  And you were on Outnumbered. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=17.56s)]
*  I was indeed. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=19.92s)]
*  I was the one lucky guy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=20.92s)]
*  Well, Zelensky was the one unlucky guy on Friday there. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=22.36s)]
*  And this kind of stuff does happen between presidents and world leaders behind closed [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=28.12s)]
*  doors. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=32.92s)]
*  And then afterwards the readout is, well, the two world leaders had a frank discussion [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=33.92s)]
*  and they're united and find enough solution. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=39.08s)]
*  Well we saw that this relationship right there between the three of them is fractured. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=43.28s)]
*  And Mr. Zelensky, tone deaf, going in and fighting back, getting sassy with the president [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=48.16s)]
*  and the vice president. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=54.08s)]
*  He was sassy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=55.08s)]
*  He was sassy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=56.08s)]
*  He got some bad advice from somebody, but it certainly was not the White House. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=58.04s)]
*  They said Mr. Zelensky, show up, wear a suit. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=60.68s)]
*  Lindsey Graham said, whatever you do, don't get into an argument. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  So what does Zelensky do? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=66.52s)]
*  He gets into an argument with Donald Trump and Mr. Vance and suddenly Mr. Z is looking [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=68.32s)]
*  for plan B. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=72.56s)]
*  Yeah, he was kicked out of the White House. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=73.68s)]
*  He said, go home, go packing because we're not giving you this deal because Zelensky [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=75.48s)]
*  wanted security guarantees. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=81.32s)]
*  And President Trump and J.D. Vance said, look, you have not been grateful. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=82.92s)]
*  Look at what we've done. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  We've sent you weapons, we've sent you money and you have to be grateful. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  And it was the beginning of what could be a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=90.92s)]
*  I really think, and Brian, I want to get your thoughts on it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  I really thought he crossed the line when he implied a threat. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  When he said the ocean, you guys have the ocean separating you, but maybe not soon enough. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=102.88s)]
*  And you saw the rage in the president at that point when he goes, don't you, you have no [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=107.94s)]
*  right to say that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=112.72s)]
*  No position to tell us. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=113.72s)]
*  I thought he said that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=116.0s)]
*  Let Europe deal with it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=117.52s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=118.52s)]
*  Let other people, let other countries give money. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=119.52s)]
*  But but he also did one other thing that was extraordinary. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  Zelensky was lecturing past presidents. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=123.64s)]
*  He said, look, Obama had the chance to stop it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=126.32s)]
*  Trump had the chance to stop it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=129.8s)]
*  So he's saying, hey, you didn't stop it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=131.44s)]
*  And look where we are. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=133.44s)]
*  He said, and then Joe Biden didn't stop it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=134.44s)]
*  So he was sassy with the guy who he needed to bail him out on this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=137.32s)]
*  So on the couch, everyone was quiet except JD Vance and Marco Rubio was sitting right [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=142.76s)]
*  in the middle as secretary of state. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=147.56s)]
*  He's the one who talked to the Russians in Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=149.56s)]
*  He's the one who's going to be moving it up the ranks and maybe meeting with Lavrov again [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=152.24s)]
*  directly. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=156.2s)]
*  Here's what he said was his take on what Zelensky did wrong. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=157.2s)]
*  I really am puzzled why anyone thinks that trying to be a peacemaker is a bad thing. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=161.04s)]
*  It's only a bad thing when it's Donald Trump trying to do it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=166.28s)]
*  I would ask everybody this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=168.36s)]
*  If there are no negotiations, what is the alternative? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=169.92s)]
*  Another four years of war, another three years of war in which the United States and Europe [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=172.82s)]
*  continues to pour billions of dollars into a war in Ukraine. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=177.04s)]
*  Is that the alternative? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=180.56s)]
*  I've asked every foreign minister I meet with, tell me your idea of how this turns out. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=182.32s)]
*  Most don't have a plan. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=186.96s)]
*  A few have said, well, let's give them another year of fighting. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=188.12s)]
*  A year from now, a year later, after another year of death, another year of destruction, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=190.96s)]
*  then maybe Putin will be ready to negotiate at that point. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=196.0s)]
*  No one here is claiming Vladimir Putin is going to get the Nobel Peace Prize this year [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  or that he should be the man of the year of the Humanitarian Association. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=202.32s)]
*  What we're arguing here is he has a very large country. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  They're in full war footing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  They're cranking out weapons now at a war footing pace. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  And we need to figure out, is there a way to get them to stop the war? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=215.12s)]
*  And the only way you're going to do that is to get Russians engaged in negotiations. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=218.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=222.68s)]
*  Zelensky told the BBC that the minerals deal still—he is still ready to sign it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=223.68s)]
*  Now he is. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=228.16s)]
*  Prime Minister Stammer of the UK said it would require—they've been working, they worked [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=229.16s)]
*  over the weekend to try to come up with a peace plan. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=233.12s)]
*  And he said that it would require strong U.S. backing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=236.16s)]
*  So his formal plan, he'll send it to the U.S. and work with Donald Trump, he said. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=239.04s)]
*  NATO had a summit without us, which is—I don't think we were upset by it, but I would [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=242.24s)]
*  rather not— [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  Not helpful. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  —have NATO meetings without us. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  The—you all put together a four-step plan. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  They said to keep the military aid flowing to Ukraine is one. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=251.72s)]
*  At lasting peace must ensure Ukraine's sovereignty and security. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=254.76s)]
*  Number three, in the event of a peace deal, European leaders will aim to deter any future [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=258.04s)]
*  invasion, which I assume they're committing to troops. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=261.72s)]
*  And number four, there'll be a collision—there'll be a coalition of the willing to defend Ukraine [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=264.64s)]
*  and guarantee peace in the country. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=269.4s)]
*  In other words, they're not calling us out. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=271.04s)]
*  I don't—if anyone characterizes the Europeans as being angry at us, I have not read anything [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=273.04s)]
*  about that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=278.6s)]
*  But they're saying we have to somehow understand the U.S. might not be aboard in Ukraine. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=279.6s)]
*  I think they're calling us out. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=284.44s)]
*  I really do. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=285.8s)]
*  I think they're upset. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  We're going to do it ourselves. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  Knock yourself out. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  Knock yourself out. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  If you want to do it by yourself. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  But again, all of this is virtue. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  All of the photos that were released, all of the meetings that were released, because [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=296.16s)]
*  at the end of the day, you had the ambassador from the UK that said—after all of us saying [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=299.6s)]
*  all of that nonsense said, oh, none of this happens without the support of the United [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=304.24s)]
*  States. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=308.36s)]
*  Well, here's ultimately what's going to happen. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=309.36s)]
*  They had on paper the deal that was going to be signed. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=310.36s)]
*  Whatever the magic number was, how many hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of minerals [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=313.32s)]
*  the United States was going to get, Donald Trump just got a better deal because eventually [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=318.23999999999995s)]
*  we're going to sign it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=323.4s)]
*  But whatever that number was, say it was $200 billion, now it's $300 or $400. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=324.67999999999995s)]
*  That's how Donald Trump works when it comes to negotiating. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=331.55999999999995s)]
*  Hey, you blew it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=333.96s)]
*  You want to come back and talk to me? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=334.96s)]
*  It's going to cost you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=336.76s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=337.76s)]
*  But I think in the big picture, think long term. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bT8smBqJs&t=338.76s)]
