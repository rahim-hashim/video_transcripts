# ‘OVER THE TOP’: Democrats called out for ‘wasting’ 2024 campaign
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU)
*  It's all about the voice of the voters and a recent Fox News op-ed by Mark Penn is highlighting eight major lessons [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=0.0s)]
*  The Democrats and President-elect Trump should take away from the results here discussed is the author [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=6.48s)]
*  Pulster mark and mark great to see you this morning. You have eight lessons to take away from this election [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=12.44s)]
*  Which we can share it with the audience [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=18.52s)]
*  I want to focus in though on a few of them if you wouldn't mind in the time that we have together here [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=19.48s)]
*  I want to start with this that the politics of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Demonization did not work Democrats went all in on demonization mark and it clearly failed [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think that's right and I think that they went way over the top here Hitler fascist [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=36.16s)]
*  Picking up on these things and I think the the voters just tune those out eventually because they're way over the top look [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=43.64s)]
*  I I remember, you know back in the presidential campaigns [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=50.36s)]
*  If you went too far even the candidate and the president Clinton would say you can't call Bob Dole that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=54.28s)]
*  And I think they took all the rails off and I think they wasted a lot of the campaign time [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=60.28s)]
*  Doing that because you know fundamentally campaigns need to be about issues not insults not identity [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=65.52s)]
*  So I want to focus on this one. I think you and I could have an interesting discussion [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=72.0s)]
*  I don't know if I've disagreement with you, but I think it comes down to definitions [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=75.08s)]
*  You write the mainstream media became irrelevant in some ways mark [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=78.22000000000001s)]
*  This was a coming out party for digital media and podcast [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=82.62s)]
*  But it doesn't necessarily mean that television or legacy media no longer matters [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=85.66000000000001s)]
*  And I think President Trump has said that he said it's underrated [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=90.66000000000001s)]
*  But I think attacks the kind of which for example, we're seeing against Pete Hegseth from CBS. They're a dull knife [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=93.78s)]
*  They mean nothing. No one gives them credibility anymore because they're wrong all the time [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  So maybe the question is who is mainstream media who is now irrelevant? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=104.62s)]
*  Well, look I think that's right I mean I think I think again we're an agreement agreement here on that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=110.17999999999999s)]
*  But if you if you just went through the daily headlines every single day in say the Washington Post to the New York Times [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=115.58s)]
*  you know the daily headline was Kamala Harris walks on water and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=122.58s)]
*  Donald Trump, you know [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=127.14s)]
*  Again, right and it was really every day [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=129.38s)]
*  It was really if you if you read the Babylon beat it was it was comical it was so it was so tilted [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=131.98000000000002s)]
*  So therefore again like these demonization attacks this ridiculous coverage [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=138.10000000000002s)]
*  Didn't mean anything to people and in fact [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=144.22s)]
*  We know that the credibility of the media the mainstream media fell to a record low [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=147.24s)]
*  Right Gallup poll and some mine, you know [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=152.22s)]
*  The reason I bring that up mark is is mainstream media defined by its distribution platform like you and I right now on cable [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=154.9s)]
*  A lot of people turn when I talk about mainstream me and go will your mainstream media? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=160.98s)]
*  Well, that may be if we're defining it by distribution platform [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=164.45999999999998s)]
*  But to your point Fox is an outlier and the chorus on those other media outlets is exactly what you said [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=168.57999999999998s)]
*  And it just didn't work. No one believes them anymore [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=174.32s)]
*  The one last thing I want to ask you mark on this is you said President Biden shouldn't have run [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=177.29999999999998s)]
*  That was one of your lessons in retrospect would Biden have had a better shot than Harris [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=181.42s)]
*  No, I don't think so I think Biden really wasn't up to another term [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=186.5s)]
*  I think the American people saw that clearly in the debate [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  I think as you know, the media the campaign did everything they could to cover that up [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  It would have come out. I think you I think frankly it would have been another two or three points here [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=201.18s)]
*  It would have been a if this was a wipeout. It would have been a double wipeout. He never should have run [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=206.94s)]
*  I mean, I think that was clear everybody knew it [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=211.62s)]
*  Nobody took the keys away from that really old guy and he wanted to drive the car still around [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=215.02s)]
*  Right. He definitely did. He definitely did not want to give up the keys mark. Great to see you early this morning [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=221.02s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. I'm Steve juicy [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EX7Sb0TCpU&t=226.42s)]
