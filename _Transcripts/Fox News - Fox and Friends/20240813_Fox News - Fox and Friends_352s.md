# Elon Musk invites Kamala Harris for X interview
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I)
*  All right, Trump calling out Kamala Harris and the Democrats in that wide-ranging interview with Elon Musk [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=0.0s)]
*  Ty paro has the highlights good morning [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=6.04s)]
*  It's all for of you former president Trump and Elon Musk delving into a roughly two hour long conversation [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=8.88s)]
*  More than 1 million people joining to listen in to two men who spent a lot of time discussing inflation watch [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=13.8s)]
*  The thing that they really is making them angry is what? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=20.96s)]
*  Kamala and Biden have allowed to happen to the economy [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=25.6s)]
*  It's a disaster with inflation the inflation. It doesn't matter what you make the inflation has eaten you alive [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=28.86s)]
*  Trump slamming Harris for not doing an extended interview for more than three weeks [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=37.22s)]
*  You think Biden could do this interview. Do you think that? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=42.84s)]
*  They would take a pass. No, they could I it's pretty sad when you think that somebody that does this for a living can't answer [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=47.0s)]
*  Question or is afraid to do an interview [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=54.12s)]
*  Musk inviting Harris to speak with him on X as well [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=56.599999999999994s)]
*  But she is unlikely to do so considering she has not done an interview in 23 days since launching her campaign [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=59.66s)]
*  But doesn't really matter Harris did just get a glowing Time magazine cover without even being [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=66.32s)]
*  Interviewed it's a different tune from the press with previous headlines like this from the Washington Post [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=73.96s)]
*  Remember this was just months ago when the press was saying this quote for the country's sake [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=78.72s)]
*  Vice President Harris should step aside or New York magazine making quote the case for Biden to drop [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=83.06s)]
*  Kamala Harris and the New York Times saying quote Kamala Harris is trying to define her vice presidency [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=90.18s)]
*  Even her allies are tired of waiting guys much different than that Time magazine cover and article [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=96.22s)]
*  How do you get a profile piece? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  Without a profile right she wouldn't give into an interview. She would not do it [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=105.10000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, you know, let's not be surprised for the picture no [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=108.34s)]
*  They didn't even talk to her. They talked to Pete Buttigieg [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=114.58s)]
*  They talked to somebody from CNN and a gun control advocate instead of talking to her [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=117.26s)]
*  But don't be surprised that they gave her the cover of Time magazine. Remember not surprised remember before Obama [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  He was given a Nobel Peace Prize. Yeah before he did anything for peace and not being George Bush [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=130.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and so at least she's running because she's not Joe Biden they keep making this comparison [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=136.22s)]
*  But at least Obama agree with him or not. At least he had that it factor [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=141.62s)]
*  He had rallies where people loved him. He started as a state center worked his way up [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=144.9s)]
*  There was a message behind them [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=149.58s)]
*  You used to see everyone with the t-shirts and everything and I don't see this big movement of Kamala yet [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=151.38s)]
*  She gets to be on the cover with no interviews at least Obama did interviews. He did right [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=158.38s)]
*  So she's got 80 plus days. She says I'm gonna talk to my people about doing an interview in August [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=163.34s)]
*  Donald Trump's been interviewed yesterday with Elon Musk. Yeah, but for her it's still working [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=173.74s)]
*  I mean her she's not declining in the polls. She's gone up a little bit [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=179.02s)]
*  She's kind of plateaued and this is even an off week because it's not until next week with the DNC [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=183.78s)]
*  Just imagine how Hollywood is going to present through videos and stuff like that and speakers and everything else [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  What is going on with Kamala Harris? It's going to be a don't be surprised [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=196.84s)]
*  Usually you get a bump after your convention. Yeah, no doubt about it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=201.62s)]
*  It was tough for Trump to get a bump because he had nobody to go against a bump against who he left [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=204.58s)]
*  He bumped him right out by the way, this is my analogy and I think it might be brilliant [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=209.12s)]
*  Okay, it's like trying to win American Idol without singing just by going on stage and looking and they're like, oh, that's the winner [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  Wait a second. They haven't started singing it. It's so we have no idea what she stands for what you gonna do [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=219.46s)]
*  But she looks the part she looks great walking on stage there. Look at my guy. My coach is so happy [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=224.18s)]
*  He's got like this way of clapping which is so interesting [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=229.82s)]
*  Your candidate that's on American Idol that hasn't sung yet did have some some songs. They were not hits, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=233.74s)]
*  They were so bad. Yeah, that's exactly what her record is right and then when she does sing it says he's heck like Trump [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=240.22s)]
*  So my analogy is somewhat brilliant because you're building up well, here's the thing she has presented an [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=249.5s)]
*  idea a vision [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=256.22s)]
*  The big question is is that enough for a lot of people? I will a majority of vision [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=257.98s)]
*  Well, her vision is a brighter tomorrow brighter tomorrow. So Annie's vision [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=262.98s)]
*  She hasn't gone into any specifics yet because then she's politically that's complicated, right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=267.62s)]
*  And so the Sun will come out tomorrow that tomorrow and so is a day away [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=273.58s)]
*  Yeah, it is indeed right Arf [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=278.38s)]
*  She keeps changing her positions because she knows if she has to if she sticks to the way [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=281.22s)]
*  She's voted her entire political career. She will lose [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=285.58s)]
*  That's why she didn't get the nomination the first time and they grabbed Joe Biden from oblivion [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=288.90000000000003s)]
*  Now one said you can at least pretend to be a moderate. You don't have to campaign. What do you think? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  He said yes, I'll do this for four years [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=297.66s)]
*  I put Kamala Harris in priest Kamala Harris and for three and a half years [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=299.94s)]
*  People have been trying to get rid of her and back to LA Times headline was the incredible disappearing vice president [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=304.18s)]
*  And now without even any warning they told us she's half Margaret Thatcher half in Dira Gandhi [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=309.82s)]
*  Well, so congratulations the offer still stands on this program if she ever wants it. We just want to ask questions [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=315.22s)]
*  We don't want a fact check. We want to push back really it just asked just give give us something [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=320.62s)]
*  Let us know where you stand. We do have some segments book like the back-to-school segment. That's cool. We can't put her anywhere [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=326.9s)]
*  That's right. So if she does come on we just need some warning [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=332.86s)]
*  I will tell you this our bookers call them every day every day every day. No response. All right. I'm Steve juicy [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTb3cY3CJ4I&t=336.3s)]
