# Duke lacrosse accuser admits she made up rape allegations
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g)
*  Alright to a Fox News alert the accuser at the center of the infamous [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=0.0s)]
*  2006 Duke lacrosse rape case just admitted to making the whole story up channeling painter is here with the details [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  Hey, Charlie. Hey, good morning. That's right. It was a huge national story back in 2006 when Crystal Mangum falsely accused three Duke [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=10.96s)]
*  lacrosse players of raping her while she was performing as a stripper at a team party in March of that year and now more than [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=19.04s)]
*  18 years later [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=26.84s)]
*  She is finally admitting that she lied about it all saying this quote [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=27.88s)]
*  I testified falsely against them by saying that they raped me when they didn't and that was wrong [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  And I betrayed the trust of a lot of other people who believed in me [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  I made up a story that wasn't true because I wanted validation from people and from God the 46 year old also [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=41.76s)]
*  Apologized to the three Duke players who were all found innocent of the crimes and later sued the university [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  After their case was dismissed in 2007 reaching an undisclosed settlement and the prosecutor on the case Mike Nafon was later [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=55.62s)]
*  disbarred for lying in court and withholding DNA evidence which ultimately absolved the young men and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=63.34s)]
*  At the time Magnum was not prosecuted for perjury due to questions about her mental health [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=69.34s)]
*  But she is currently behind bars serving time after a jury convicted her of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of her boyfriend in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=74.56s)]
*  2013 and even now with her admission [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=82.9s)]
*  Mangum says well Mangum could not be charged [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=86.14s)]
*  Excuse me with perjury because of the statute of limitations of course in the state of North Carolina guys back to you [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=88.78s)]
*  Yeah, we knew she wasn't we knew she was lying. She got caught lying, but we haven't had her admission [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=94.14s)]
*  But you should point out something about her background. Yeah, I think she only just mentioned it. She's serving prison [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=99.54s)]
*  She's in prison for murdering her boyfriend. Yeah [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  She's she is and and Shanley mentioned that she cannot be held liable in North Carolina because of the statute of limitations [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=107.1s)]
*  It's only two years [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=113.7s)]
*  Shanley also mentioned the DA remember nai fong. He was on the news all the time and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  shortly [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=122.02s)]
*  After the players were charged. He said there is no doubt [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=123.3s)]
*  About this being a sexual assault that it took place and he said it was racially motivated [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=127.82s)]
*  And then when he was disbarred he was disbarred because he withheld DNA evidence that would have helped the players [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=133.54s)]
*  but that never came out people have a right to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=140.29999999999998s)]
*  Come forward with their allegations, and I think we should litigate them in court [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=143.73999999999998s)]
*  But there has to be a severe penalty when people go out there and just make up stuff lie and destroy people [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=148.1s)]
*  Lives, you know I think about the lady. What was she 80 something the lady that falsely accused [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=155.7s)]
*  Emmett till of them she was 87 and she finally admitted that she was lying and people were like she shouldn't stand trial for that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=160.92s)]
*  Absolutely. I don't care what age you are when you finally reach your conscience of wanting to tell the truth about a situation [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=167.04s)]
*  You should be prosecuted [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=173.48s)]
*  There should be severe penalty these guys are never gonna have their lives back. The damage has been done and reframe Emmett till [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=175.16s)]
*  Refrain he was killed by him. He was killed but he was lynched [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=181.88s)]
*  Was 14 year olds was falsely accused by a woman and later on her life [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  I think she just died like a year ago. She was in her 80s. She finally came forward and said it was all [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=190.56s)]
*  true, so [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  There's consequences [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=196.98s)]
*  now I'm not saying this is the same in his way because no one was lynched but there [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=198.84s)]
*  Their lives were destroyed as well [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=203.44s)]
*  So there has to be consequences for that if it's true, let it be litigated in court [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=205.56s)]
*  I just hope this is a cautionary tale for the media. Don't just run so what allegations you just reminded me to you know [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=211.48s)]
*  It did happen. The coach got fired [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=217.82s)]
*  Yes immediately and he ends it up going to another school in Rhode Island Bryant and revitalizing that program [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  But he was considered one of the coaches John Donovsky a fantastic coach went down there with his son and they restored the program [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=226.02s)]
*  But essentially he gets fired they find out it's all a lie those kids [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=232.72s)]
*  young [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=237.88s)]
*  Graduate they can't get jobs and now they don't want this on their resume. They're hoping their names not picked up, but this is [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=238.84s)]
*  This is good news for them. That's why I mean not to make this about God [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=245.0s)]
*  But the Ten Commandments he tells us not to do these things to prevent us from hurting ourselves and hurting other people [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=249.04s)]
*  Says not to lie not to cheat [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=255.0s)]
*  Their consequences for these actions [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=257.32s)]
*  You know what she did at the same time as she admitted that she made up the story which destroyed their lives, right? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=259.36s)]
*  She is asking those three young men to forgive she is asking yeah, we can forgive but not forget [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=266.52s)]
*  Oh, the captain the team is actually from my town and I remember they the whole family was like we will never talk about it [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSvTBm0h1g&t=272.96s)]
