# DIY expert reveals genius tips to take your tailgate to the 'next level'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g)
*  It's national tailgating day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=0.0s)]
*  We've got our own tailgate happening right here on Fox Square. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=3.2s)]
*  Joining us now with all the gear you need to take your tailgate to the next level, DIY [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=6.04s)]
*  expert, Chip Wade. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=10.92s)]
*  Chip. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=12.24s)]
*  Well, food's always a great theme. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=13.24s)]
*  We're going to start on the grill. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=14.24s)]
*  We're grilling on our Rectex. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=15.24s)]
*  We've got the backyard beast here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  We've got Chef Greg making it happen for us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=17.68s)]
*  Again, we've got more heat, more precision, and a lot more stainless steel on these Rectex [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=20.12s)]
*  grills, which is amazing. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=24.32s)]
*  These are Wi-Fi controlled, which means you don't have to miss a minute of the game while [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=25.42s)]
*  the food is cooking. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=29.04s)]
*  You know about these pellet grills that just absolutely do awesome. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=30.04s)]
*  You're going to love that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=32.84s)]
*  This one, though, this is called the Road Warrior. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=33.84s)]
*  You can see it has the collapse and go base with the wheels. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=36.96s)]
*  So this actually fits in the back of your truck, the back of your SUV, all the same [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  great quality. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=43.58s)]
*  And right now they're giving away a bundle on Rectex.com of this grill. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=44.58s)]
*  So you've got to get you one for your tailgate. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=48.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=49.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=50.36s)]
*  Next up, we have got the innovative, don't show off the horns. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=51.36s)]
*  It's iconic. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=53.8s)]
*  It's iconic. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=54.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=55.8s)]
*  Next up, we've got crocodile cloth. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=56.8s)]
*  These are from all kinds of great cleaning products, but they have the new grill cloth. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=57.8s)]
*  Look at these guys. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=61.32s)]
*  They're enormous. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=62.32s)]
*  Ten inches by 15 inches and they stay wet. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=63.32s)]
*  They're going to outperform a paper towel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  I got some jalapeno. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=67.92s)]
*  There you go. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=68.92s)]
*  There you go. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=69.92s)]
*  There you go. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=70.92s)]
*  So what's cool about these guys, though, they stay wet a year in the package. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=71.92s)]
*  But then these are actually NSF. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=74.17999999999999s)]
*  Look, it worked. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=75.44s)]
*  There you go. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=76.44s)]
*  They're NSF grill safe, which means that you can clean your utensils on them and you can [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=77.44s)]
*  come back over here to your grill. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=81.88s)]
*  They're actually made to clean the stainless steel ceramic porcelain grates. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=83.72s)]
*  And you don't have to clean them off because they're surface safe. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=87.28s)]
*  Oh, great. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=89.6s)]
*  Very good. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=90.6s)]
*  You can find these at Home Depot, Amazon, and of course, Crocodile Cloth. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=91.6s)]
*  There you go. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=93.32s)]
*  Take you one. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=94.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=95.32s)]
*  Next up, we've got FLI products. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=96.32s)]
*  We've all experienced transporting our cutlery and it's kind of always sketchy, right? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=97.52s)]
*  You have the sheets sometimes, but they fall off and you can cut yourself. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=101.72s)]
*  These are different because these blade guards clip on and they don't come off. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=104.72s)]
*  These are all dishwasher safe, made right here in the United States. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=109.08s)]
*  Again, FLIProducts.com. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=111.52s)]
*  Really great different colors, too. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  Of course, they've got the leather chef roll and the Poros spouts, which fit your spirits, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=115.2s)]
*  you know, your salad dressings. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=120.68s)]
*  They even have a new spout for mason jars so it can make it really fun. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=121.68s)]
*  Really great. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=125.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=126.0s)]
*  Next up, we're going to power up our tailgate. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=127.0s)]
*  Y'all know I love talking about generators. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=128.0s)]
*  Solar generators. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=129.0s)]
*  This is for Patriots. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=130.0s)]
*  This one is called the 2000X. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=131.0s)]
*  What's cool about this, though, is this month you get a free generator when you buy this [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=133.16s)]
*  one. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=136.84s)]
*  It's this guy right here, the Patriot Power Sidekick. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=137.84s)]
*  This guy right here, 300 watts, perfect for the tailgate. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  Really great. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=142.96s)]
*  September4Patriots.com. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=144.72s)]
*  A great new package. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=145.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=146.72s)]
*  Last up, we're going to make our tailgate more comfortable with Pitman Outdoors. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=147.72s)]
*  This is the original air beds, truck bed, air mattress. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=151.16s)]
*  They make it to fit your exact truck bed, whether it's a Jeep, whether it's a Bronco. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=154.36s)]
*  And they even have right behind you the tailgate extension to make it even more comfortable. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=157.84s)]
*  But you can take this guy inside, use it as an air mattress for your bed. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=161.54000000000002s)]
*  Actually, these fill in the voids that are out for the wheel wells. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=164.52s)]
*  Really, really great. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=167.28s)]
*  Of course, they've got the Pitman Outdoors easy up truck tents, which are awesome, too, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=168.44s)]
*  for continuing the shelter. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=173.52s)]
*  Is it easy to? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  Five minutes, I set this up. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  Finally, we've got the Pitman Outdoors heated chairs. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=178.8s)]
*  These guys right here, 400 pound rating. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=181.88s)]
*  It just puts a little battery pack in there. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  You can dial in the heat. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=185.4s)]
*  You need that for the soccer game. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=186.4s)]
*  It's super comfortable. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=187.4s)]
*  Yeah, I do, actually. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=188.4s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=189.4s)]
*  So what I'll do is go over to ChipWade.com where I can see all this stuff. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=190.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=194.56s)]
*  I'm going to go ahead and turn this off. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTs3aekqb7g&t=203.52s)]
