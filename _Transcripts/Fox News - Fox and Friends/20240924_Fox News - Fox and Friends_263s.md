# 'TURF WAR?': Chicago gangs clash with Venezuelan Tren de Aragua
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc)
*  So, Venezuelan gang members moving into Chicago have caught the tension of the city's local [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=0.0s)]
*  counterparts, bringing tensions to an all-time high. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=5.12s)]
*  Our next guest is a former gang member who now runs a violence prevention program and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=8.52s)]
*  warns that the city may go up in flames fearing an all-out turf war. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Tyrone Muhammad is the founder and CEO of Xcons for Community and Social Change, and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  he's been kind enough to join us. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Now, Tyrone, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=25.52s)]
*  So, let's first, before we get into the criminal element, talk about the money that's being [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=27.88s)]
*  spent because I know you talk about the community and building those black communities and Hispanic [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=32.68s)]
*  communities in Chicago that were affected before this crisis. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=39.14s)]
*  They're spending $464 million on this crisis. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Can y'all be using that money somewhere else? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=47.72s)]
*  You know, I don't know any household, Lawrence, where you yourself would pay my mortgage before [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=53.08s)]
*  you pay your own. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=61.12s)]
*  That is really, that would be considered crazy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=62.96s)]
*  So that's the very fact that our government believe with all the issues and systemic disinvestment [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=66.56s)]
*  that's happening to all these communities throughout America, that you were in our face [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=73.52s)]
*  when, specifically Chicago, where black voters have voted for one party consistently and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=79.68s)]
*  religiously, that that party would not listen to the voters or the community to say, us [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=89.68s)]
*  first, we should be first, put us first. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  And the very notion that anyone would have the audacity to think that non-citizens should [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=101.0s)]
*  go before the black community and the most impoverished communities is asinine. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=106.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's really a slap in the face. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=112.64s)]
*  So now you, so that's the first part of this problem. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=115.8s)]
*  The second problem is that you got the gangs that are coming in now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=118.8s)]
*  Twente de Agua is now fighting with the local gangs. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=122.16s)]
*  And this is, this is on top of an already problem right now. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  You got robbery that's up 12%. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=129.14s)]
*  Aggravated battery is up 13%. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=131.68s)]
*  Motor vehicle theft is up 43%. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=134.8s)]
*  And you're inviting them in to go against now the local gangs already in Chicago. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=138.0s)]
*  Explain to us what's happening on the ground. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=143.96s)]
*  So let me just say this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  We just heard about a vice president who said she, she specialized in locking up and arresting [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=148.82000000000002s)]
*  transnational gangs. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=157.44s)]
*  Now the very party that she's a part of, the policies with the sanctuary cities and the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=160.16s)]
*  border crisis, she support. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=168.16s)]
*  And now the influx of, which is oxymoronic at the same time, now we have to fight transnational [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=171.44s)]
*  gangs and the influx of these men who we don't know where they come, what crimes they committed, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=178.0s)]
*  and the violence that they've been involved with thus far. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=186.92s)]
*  With that being said, we're on the front line every day making sure that our communities [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=190.64s)]
*  are safe. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  And it's really not about the black community. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  This is just the beginning because violence anywhere is violence everywhere. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=199.88s)]
*  America should be afraid that this can happen in America's cities. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=204.92s)]
*  One of the biggest cities, most tourists, one of the biggest tourist attracting cities [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=209.44s)]
*  in the country that we can watch this happen all over the country and not be outraged. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=214.6s)]
*  And this is the policies, sir. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=221.84s)]
*  This is what I'm saying, Lawrence. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=223.68s)]
*  It's the policies that has affected our community and has turned black people, black communities [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=225.0s)]
*  against the current administration. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  You know Tyrone, you hit it on the head just because they invited them into our communities [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=234.72s)]
*  to stay, took our resources in black America. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=240.64s)]
*  That doesn't mean that the criminal element is not going to spread nationwide. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=243.84s)]
*  And you've been on the front line of this. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=247.76s)]
*  I look forward to having you back Tyrone. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=249.48s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4bFy_I3Xc&t=251.20000000000002s)]
