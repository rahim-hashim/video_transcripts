# 'PURELY POLITICAL': Biden admin slammed for misusing Strategic Petroleum Reserve
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI)
*  We are back with Fox Business contributor Phil Flynn. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=0.0s)]
*  We have him back and he's here to discuss the Strategic [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=2.88s)]
*  Petroleum Reserve, which is at a 40 year low. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  You were just telling us, Phil, just before we lost you, that [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=8.0s)]
*  the Biden administration is misusing this reserve. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=12.24s)]
*  Explain. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=15.84s)]
*  It is. This was a reserve that was basically built to protect [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=17.44s)]
*  the U.S. economy against oil price shocks. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=21.16s)]
*  But President Biden started to tap this reserve for political [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  purposes. The first time he did it, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=27.52s)]
*  Rachel was to send a message to Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=29.82s)]
*  You know, he wanted to make Saudi Arabia a pariah state. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=32.62s)]
*  And when Saudi Arabia didn't do his bidding by raising [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=35.34s)]
*  production, he released oil to send them a message. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=39.26s)]
*  So that was purely political and it backfired. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=42.06s)]
*  It probably led to OPEC production cuts that have kept global [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=44.66s)]
*  supplies low and kept prices high. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=48.22s)]
*  And it's also hurt investment because people don't want to invest [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=50.94s)]
*  in U.S. oil if the government's going to intervene in the market. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=54.3s)]
*  No, no, absolutely. Also, this was interesting. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=57.699999999999996s)]
*  Joe Biden released one hundred and eighty million barrels, but we [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=61.22s)]
*  only have cash for ten point five million. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=65.14s)]
*  Where's all the other money? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=67.98s)]
*  Where's the money? Where's the money? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=70.22s)]
*  That's what I want to know. You know, the U.S. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=72.5s)]
*  taxpayers paid for this oil, you know, in good faith. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=74.62s)]
*  Right. And the government, it seems like whenever they get their [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=77.94s)]
*  hands on some extra money, you know, they can't they can't keep [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=81.18s)]
*  their hands on it. They have to spend it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=84.78s)]
*  You know, in fact, you know, the Biden administration at one point was [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=86.46s)]
*  bragging, well, we sold oil when prices were high and we're going to buy it [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  back low. Well, that's only good if you can actually do it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=93.17999999999999s)]
*  If you don't have the money to buy it back, you're going to keep inventories [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=96.7s)]
*  low. And the chances of a dramatic price spike that can hurt Americans is a lot [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=99.97999999999999s)]
*  higher. Let's play a game, Phil. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  Let's guess where that money went. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=107.5s)]
*  I call Ukraine. What do you say? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=109.42s)]
*  I would I would I would say you're a pretty good guesser there, you know, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=112.3s)]
*  and I'd say the other place has been China. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=115.82s)]
*  Well, I know where the oil went. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=118.58s)]
*  If a lot of it went to China. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=119.97999999999999s)]
*  So I don't know. Zping is probably right in an oil barrel today. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=121.58s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah. Well, just as we've depleted and Europe, by the way, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=125.05999999999999s)]
*  we encourage Europe to deplete their reserves. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=128.34s)]
*  We've depleted ours. China beefing up theirs. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=130.29999999999998s)]
*  Interesting. Yes, it is. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=133.78s)]
*  And I'll tell you this, you know, I mean, I want to go back to rebuilding [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=136.26s)]
*  the reserve because it's one of the best deterrents against our neighbors. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=140.06s)]
*  Great job. Thanks, Phil. Always insightful. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=144.3s)]
*  Best person to talk about this issue. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=146.94000000000003s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=148.86s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. You got it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RceqSTOzfuI&t=150.94000000000003s)]
