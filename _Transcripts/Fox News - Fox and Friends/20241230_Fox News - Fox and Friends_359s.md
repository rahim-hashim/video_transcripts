# Biden reportedly reveals long list of regrets before leaving office
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4)
*  Let's talk more about Joe Biden because he has some regrets wishes he had done some things differently [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=0.0s)]
*  Now that he is on the doorstep of walking out of the White House [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=5.72s)]
*  He's looking back and saying hey, what could I've done differently and the main thing seems to be he wishes [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=9.48s)]
*  He would have stayed in the race. He thinks he could have won with some of the reports over the weekend [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=13.4s)]
*  somewhat delusional [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=17.52s)]
*  That he thinks he could want because I mean [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=19.12s)]
*  He did give us all this evidence when he took the stage in that debate against Donald Trump [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=22.12s)]
*  That two trillion dollar tax cut benefited the very wealthy [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=30.24s)]
*  The I what I'm gonna do is fix the tax system. For example, we have a thousand trillionaires in America [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=34.16s)]
*  I mean billionaires in America if they just paid 24% [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=39.36s)]
*  25% either one of those numbers they'd raise 500 million dollars billion dollars [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=43.84s)]
*  I should say making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=49.18s)]
*  Eligible for what I've been able to do with the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=55.2s)]
*  With the coven excuse me with dealing with everything we have to do with [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=57.5s)]
*  Look [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=65.22s)]
*  if [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=67.10000000000001s)]
*  We finally beat Medicare. Thank You President Biden and I'm going to continue to move until we get the total ban on [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=68.58s)]
*  the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=76.30000000000001s)]
*  total initiative relative to what we're gonna do with more Border Patrol and more [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=77.78s)]
*  asylum officers [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=83.18s)]
*  President Trump, I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said either look [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=84.42s)]
*  That was the moment that was and look the the struggling of the losing his train of thought and then like we finally beat Medicare [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=91.14s)]
*  very very strange thing and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=98.2s)]
*  The problem that just comes back to mind guys is we were told [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=101.18s)]
*  leading up to that moment [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=106.5s)]
*  aggressively [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=108.66s)]
*  That that man was not only perfectly fine in that moment [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  He was suited and ready to go for four more years and that's what they told us right in control sharp as attack all of that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=113.82000000000001s)]
*  Nonsense, and then the lie which was clearly a lie to many of us for quite some time [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=120.14s)]
*  Totally disintegrated over a span of about 20 or 25 minutes on that debate stage. That's why I think you know [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=124.94s)]
*  Joe Biden's sort of an ornery guy in some respects. He's very proud [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=131.62s)]
*  I'm sure he does believe that he could have stayed in the race and not been forced out and could have won [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=135.1s)]
*  But delusional I think is the right word there Kamala Harris was untalented and a terrible candidate, but she lost less [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=140.9s)]
*  Badly than he would have because the American people what 70 million tune in to that debate [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=148.38s)]
*  They saw that person and said there is no way he can be president for four more years [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=152.5s)]
*  He would have lost badly. I think I just remember going back to this summer and and the way this whole thing played out [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=157.34s)]
*  So there was this debate then there was rumor about whether Joe Biden would stay in the race [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=163.98s)]
*  Then George Clooney comes out with the op-ed that was the first knife in the back after just two months earlier [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=168.78s)]
*  He told the country at that fundraiser with Obama [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=174.34s)]
*  That Joe Biden's fine. He should be the next president. He's totally fit to continue on this race [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=177.7s)]
*  You should all get millions of dollars to keep him on the campaign trail against Donald Trump [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=182.02s)]
*  Biden said no, I'm staying in then you started seeing additional people coming out and saying it's time to go Nancy Pelosi was circling [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=186.46s)]
*  The wagons you had Barack Obama doing it [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=193.82s)]
*  You had Adam Schiff doing it and as Joe Biden continued to double down and make the single case [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=195.82s)]
*  Show me polling that shows that Kamala Harris is a better candidate than I am against Trump and I will drop out of the race [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=202.54s)]
*  They couldn't do it and eventually the pressure got so high that he resigned from the campaign trail [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=208.14s)]
*  Through a letter that was put out on a Sunday afternoon on X and we didn't hear from him for 24 [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=214.62s)]
*  Hours, so there wasn't a lot of explanation about why after four weeks he was saying I'm not leaving the race [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  I can beat Trump. I'm a better candidate and now the Washington Post is reporting it this way [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  They're saying quote in private Biden has also said he should have picked someone other than Merrick Garland as his attorney general [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=233.68s)]
*  Complaining about the Justice Department slowness under Garland and prosecuting Trump and its aggressiveness and prosecuting Biden's son Hunter [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  So while all this is going on with him being exposed at the debate for his mental acuity [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=248.26s)]
*  His son Hunter is going to be on trial for a number of felonies [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=253.62s)]
*  And at this time he's still insisting he's not going to pardon him [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=259.26s)]
*  Which of course we all know was not true [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=261.94s)]
*  I was laying his cards on the table as well [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=263.78s)]
*  The lawfare was designed to affect the electoral hopes of Donald Trump and he's saying [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=265.42s)]
*  Merrick Garland didn't press the issue enough or I would have one soon enough fast enough hard enough [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=269.1s)]
*  And if you had Merrick Garland he has regrets apparently now about Merrick Garland then I might have won I mean [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=274.54s)]
*  You have explained exactly what we all accused you of for some time. You're using the justice system weaponizing it in [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  In pursuit of a political end so if he had put him in prison [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=287.06s)]
*  Federal prison before the Supreme Court could have come down with the immunity ruling that they did in June [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=291.26s)]
*  That's Biden's argument that he would have been able to win this election, right? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=297.02000000000004s)]
*  Which is insane and as a American reportedly complaining enough to enough people behind the scenes that this is now leaking out to the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=300.38s)]
*  Washington Post his one aside from getting out of the race [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=308.02s)]
*  His one biggest regret is having an attorney general who didn't prosecute his opponent fast enough and who did prosecute his criminal son [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  And he's saying it openly right the game is sort of over at this point, right? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=320.38s)]
*  And so he's he's dishing out his pardons and and grousing on his way out the door [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=325.62s)]
*  And I think there's a reason why his approval ratings are absolutely in the toilet right now [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=329.97999999999996s)]
*  He has very much earned them and what does Joe Biden do when he leaves office on January 20th, right? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=334.18s)]
*  I mean the Democratic Party is looking forward to him leaving. He can finally take a break and go to the beach [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=339.28s)]
*  He can finally take a vacation maybe but [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9YGjEXvcW4&t=344.21999999999997s)]
