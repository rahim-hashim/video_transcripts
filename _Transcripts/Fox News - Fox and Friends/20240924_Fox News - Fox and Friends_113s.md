**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw)
*  Fox News alert right now. Former President Donald Trump will reportedly return to that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=0.0s)]
*  spot, Butler, Pennsylvania, for a rally next week. That is the town where his first assassination [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=6.04s)]
*  attempt occurred. Meanwhile, we're learning chilly new details about the suspect in the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=13.08s)]
*  second assassination attempt. Brooke Singman joins us right now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Good morning, Steve. Yeah, the former president is expected to return to Butler, Pennsylvania [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=22.76s)]
*  on October 5th, which is exactly one month before Election Day. Meanwhile, the Justice [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=26.6s)]
*  Department is weighing more serious charges against Ryan Ruth, the suspect in the second [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=31.44s)]
*  assassination attempt. Prosecutors are now pursuing an attempted assassination charge, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=36.2s)]
*  which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Ruth remains behind bars for now after [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=41.2s)]
*  being denied bond by a federal judge. This after prosecutors presented chilling new [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=46.64s)]
*  a letter he wrote several months ago where he says, quote, This was an assassination [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=52.88s)]
*  attempt on Donald Trump. We are also learning Ruth had six cell phones in his car at the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  time of his arrest, including one with a search for directions from Mexico to I'm sorry, from [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=62.32s)]
*  Palm Beach to Mexico. Agents found Ruth's fingerprint on tape used to attach a scope [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  to the rifle found outside of Trump's golf course. A former FBI agent says Ruth was likely [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=73.34s)]
*  influenced by other people. Listen, I don't think there are too many actual lone wolves [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=78.64s)]
*  out there anymore. And I think Ruth is no different in this particular case. So he may [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=84.0s)]
*  have been operating on his own that very day, laying prone position outside the golf course, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=88.0s)]
*  but he's been influenced by lots of other people. Ruth is currently facing two federal [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=93.56s)]
*  firearm charges. Lawrence, hopefully they upgrade them. Thanks, Brooke. I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZNCwJ8U6Qw&t=98.24000000000001s)]
