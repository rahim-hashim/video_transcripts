# DEMOCRACY 2024: What to expect on election night
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ)
*  I think there's a couple of things happening. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=0.0s)]
*  People are voting with trash bags on. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=1.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=2.62s)]
*  And they're wearing vests now [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=3.46s)]
*  and of course you have the blue tie, the red tie always. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  It's become the rallying call for the MAGA voters. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=7.08s)]
*  All right, so we're standing for a reason. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=9.8s)]
*  Yep, we got two days until election day, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=11.9s)]
*  but even with the ballots being counted, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  we may not get the results until Tuesday night. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=17.48s)]
*  This is the most common question that we get. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=19.48s)]
*  When are we gonna know? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=21.32s)]
*  So let's turn to the wall to understand [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=22.36s)]
*  why the results could take a little bit longer [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=24.02s)]
*  and some say it'll be quicker than in 2020. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=26.2s)]
*  Remember, so let's take a look at past clashes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=29.36s)]
*  I mean, this is what we remember. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=33.16s)]
*  Took four days. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=34.6s)]
*  2020, this is when Kamala gets the call. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=35.44s)]
*  We did it, Joe. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=37.82s)]
*  This is a big moment, but it was four days out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=39.04s)]
*  Right, the problem was there was a red mirage to start. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=41.24s)]
*  What was that mirage? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=43.8s)]
*  Voting day usually belongs to Republicans. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=44.94s)]
*  A lot of states, and we'll get to this later, count late. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Now let's look back. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=50.46s)]
*  Remember this, the biggest upset maybe in political history. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  This was huge. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=53.92s)]
*  This is where you saw all the tears from the anchors [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  as well as people in the crowd. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=57.6s)]
*  She was supposed to crash that glass ceiling. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=58.76s)]
*  It didn't happen, but we got the results at 2.29 a.m. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=61.36s)]
*  But guess why she did give in. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=63.96s)]
*  Barack Obama had to call her up and say, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=65.16s)]
*  Hillary, you lost, remember. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=66.8s)]
*  This was quick. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=69.24s)]
*  You got 2012, mid-rummed against Barack Obama, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=70.56s)]
*  incumbent obviously, got the election results [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  that night to 11.38. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=76.56s)]
*  Right, again, Brett was able to go to bed early here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=78.16s)]
*  McCain conceded around 11.06, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=82.08s)]
*  made a really historic speech, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=84.32s)]
*  and cited Booker T. Washington [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=86.24s)]
*  was once not invited to the White House controversy [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=87.72s)]
*  to be at the White House [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=90.24s)]
*  because there's a black man eating [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=91.84s)]
*  with a president's family, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  and then he of course would be a black president. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=94.84s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=96.88s)]
*  You got Kerry conceded very early, 11.02 a.m. the next day. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=98.2s)]
*  This, he's had a little problem. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=103.92s)]
*  This is the craziness. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=105.24s)]
*  He conceded, he's conceded, and then he unconceded, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=106.08s)]
*  but eventually would lose when they recounted Florida. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=108.56s)]
*  All right, so let's talk about [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=111.2s)]
*  why there might be a little bit of a delay. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=112.58s)]
*  This is critical right here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=114.5s)]
*  So you got, this is new for a lot of people. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  The in-person votes, obviously, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=117.64s)]
*  a lot of people talk about that, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=119.8s)]
*  but you got the mail-in ballots [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=121.12s)]
*  as well as the early voting as well. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=122.32s)]
*  All right, key states may have results delayed [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=123.6s)]
*  because of laws requiring mail-in ballots [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=125.32s)]
*  be counted election day. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=127.12s)]
*  Some go early. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=128.4s)]
*  So let's take a look at this map. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=129.32s)]
*  In the seven battleground states, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=130.52s)]
*  in the green, you allow counting to begin [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  before election day. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=135.16s)]
*  This way, when the election day results are counted, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=136.0s)]
*  you know the answer, but some have to wait [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=138.26s)]
*  by state constitution for the election day [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=140.84s)]
*  to happen to start opening up the envelopes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=144.04s)]
*  Yeah, Brett, so it's interesting. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=145.56s)]
*  When you look at Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=146.4s)]
*  so they're getting all these mail-in ballots. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=148.16s)]
*  They cannot start counting them until election day, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  so about seven a.m. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=154.4s)]
*  And then if you're gonna submit mail-in ballots, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  it has to be submitted by the time the poll closes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  Expect Georgia to come out quick. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  Expect Pennsylvania, they'll have some trouble. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=163.8s)]
*  Some counties, they always seem to do it, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=165.72s)]
*  but they're allowed to count ahead of time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=167.36s)]
*  That is key, so are they. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=169.12s)]
*  Florida did it right. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=170.4s)]
*  So you get it really quick from Florida [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=171.6s)]
*  after having trouble in the past. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=173.96s)]
*  The legal challenges. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=176.84s)]
*  The legal challenges are already happening, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=178.0s)]
*  and the thing is, what the Trump team says is, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  yeah, we challenged, we got heard in court, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=182.24s)]
*  but they basically ruled not to hear the challenge. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=184.32s)]
*  That's why so many challenges are happening [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=187.12s)]
*  before election day. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=189.28s)]
*  Most of these challenges, although you hear them [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=190.72s)]
*  on a national level, they're gonna be done [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=192.68s)]
*  on the state level. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=195.88s)]
*  There's gonna be some back and forth right there, Brett. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=197.12s)]
*  Right, I mean, this is where a lot of the campaign money [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=198.88s)]
*  went to lawyers to be ready to go. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=200.76s)]
*  Each state has its own set of rules [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=202.52s)]
*  and recount challenges and certification of results. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=204.28s)]
*  Now, each party has to understand those rules [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=206.76s)]
*  to be able to act quickly and decisively [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=210.2s)]
*  to get quick answers back, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=212.12s)]
*  because if you wait too long, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=213.6s)]
*  this whole thing gets ratified, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=215.0s)]
*  and all your challenges become something in retrospect [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=217.48s)]
*  that don't affect the results. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=220.24s)]
*  Two days out, y'all. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=221.8s)]
*  We got a big show still coming up. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=223.08s)]
*  More Fox and Friends after a quick break. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=224.24s)]
*  Yep, don't move. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=225.88s)]
*  And most compelling analysis. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZHn3c_ONQQ&t=234.28s)]
