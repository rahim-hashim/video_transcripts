# Trump's chief of staff opens up about Musk feud: 'Troublesome ending'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI)
*  And of course, things at the White House are, it's remarkable to think that it's only been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=0.0s)]
*  six months that he returned to the White House because there's so much that is going on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=5.9s)]
*  One of the things we've been through has been the bromance between Elon Musk and Donald [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=10.36s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=14.44s)]
*  That bromance now appears to be somewhat over. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=15.52s)]
*  Chief of Staff Susie Wiles talked about that this week. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=18.64s)]
*  This has been a pretty smooth presidency. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=22.46s)]
*  But one little hiccup was Elon. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=26.54s)]
*  Yeah, little hiccup. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=28.92s)]
*  Little hiccup. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=30.680000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=31.680000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I saw Elon Musk here very comfortable coming in and out of the Oval Office, you [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=32.68s)]
*  know, had sleepovers in the Lincoln bedroom. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=38.44s)]
*  It seemed almost as if he had a sort of fatherly fixation with Donald Trump that I guess inevitably [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=41.56s)]
*  was going to blow up at some point. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=50.28s)]
*  How did you see that relationship? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  Similar. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=53.72s)]
*  The president was very, very kind to him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  And Elon had so much to offer us. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=58.4s)]
*  He knew things we didn't know. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=60.8s)]
*  He knew people and technologies that we didn't know. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=62.56s)]
*  It was a great thing when it was a great thing and had a very, I think, a very troublesome [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=66.14s)]
*  ending. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  Susie Wiles has a magical ability to handle that position better than just about anybody [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=77.56s)]
*  I can think of. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=85.64s)]
*  Very interesting explanation there of his time at the White House, including sleepovers [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=88.52s)]
*  in the Lincoln bedroom. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  But to her point, though, about the access that he was able to provide this White House, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=94.88s)]
*  this administration, the contacts that he was able to bring them, interesting stuff. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=99.44s)]
*  But the description is, you know, that that's— [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=106.0s)]
*  And Trump loves— [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=109.48s)]
*  That relationship changed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=110.48s)]
*  Accomplishment. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=111.48s)]
*  He loves people who do things. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=112.48s)]
*  He's a great listener and he sort of wants to understand everything about how the rockets [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=114.36s)]
*  work, the cars work, the medical stuff works. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=120.72s)]
*  He's very impressed by that kind of stuff. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=124.92s)]
*  And the fact that Susie credits Elon Musk with providing that is a very cordial way [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=126.84s)]
*  of addressing it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=133.24s)]
*  And the cordiality makes you think, you know, this story may not be over. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=134.24s)]
*  When President Trump has shown that he can move past even his fiercest critics and find [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=139.48s)]
*  common ground, maybe we'll see the bromance return to some sort of friendlier position. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure that'll happen, but it might. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=148.83999999999997s)]
*  I'm taking myself back to the moment of the jumping on the stage during the campaigning. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=150.64s)]
*  Yeah, he was there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  He was a great asset. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk was a tremendous asset during the campaign. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  And he's a great listener. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcAujjNO-sI&t=169.48s)]
