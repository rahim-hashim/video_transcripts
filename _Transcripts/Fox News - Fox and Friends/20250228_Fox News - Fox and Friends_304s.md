# Putin has 'major problems' coming, warns retired general
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g)
*  Let's bring in General Jack Keene, four-star general, Fox News strategic analyst, chairman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Institute for the Study of War. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  General, your thoughts about the deal that's going to be coming down today, and they're [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=6.4s)]
*  going to announce it about 11 o'clock. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=10.64s)]
*  Well, I think it's overwhelmingly positive, and certainly both sides had a compromise [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  to get the deal, which is pretty normal and certainly something President Trump is used [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  to seeing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=25.48s)]
*  And why is it so positive? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=26.88s)]
*  Well, look at it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  It ties the United States to Ukraine for a generation in terms of exploration and mining [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=29.48s)]
*  for these rare minerals. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=37.2s)]
*  It ties us economically, politically, and obviously with an unbelievable interest in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=39.32s)]
*  the future security of Ukraine. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=45.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Because if war continues, there's no exploration. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  There's no construction going on. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=52.24s)]
*  There's no mining going on during a conflict. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=53.84s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=57.339999999999996s)]
*  And Putin, you know full well, does not like this deal. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=58.339999999999996s)]
*  So this deal is in the United States and Ukraine's interest. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=62.26s)]
*  And that's what makes it a good deal. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=66.36s)]
*  General, as you know, in 2014 they stopped fighting and the ceasefire was breached in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=68.14s)]
*  2022 with the invasion. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=73.06s)]
*  This time allies are saying we're going to put a peacekeeping force of maybe 30,000 there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  The UK said you can count us in. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=79.22s)]
*  Looks like France too, not us. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=81.06s)]
*  But you say that's a non-starter for Russia? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=84.5s)]
*  Well, that's a stop for, that's also a non-starter for the West. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=87.1s)]
*  Well, I think it remains to be seen if Putin is really going to negotiate and that means [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=93.5s)]
*  be willing to make some compromise. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=98.82s)]
*  He's already come in with a hard-line position at the negotiations that took place yesterday [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=100.58s)]
*  where they said they want more territory than what they're occupying. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=105.78s)]
*  He wants Ukraine to demilitarize. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=109.28s)]
*  He wants them to have an election so he can undermine that election successfully as he's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=110.98s)]
*  done very much in the past and hopefully get a stooge in there that he can influence [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=116.22s)]
*  and control. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=120.94s)]
*  He wants Ukraine to go down to 85,000 troops only and only be able to fire a missile 40 [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=122.5s)]
*  kilometers, 25, 30 miles in other words. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=127.62s)]
*  So those are very hard-line positions. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=132.1s)]
*  It remains to be seen how much progress we're going to make here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=135.38s)]
*  But Putin has got major military problems and personnel problems coming in 25. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=139.14s)]
*  There's a lot more pressure inside on Putin than what is recognized publicly. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=144.94s)]
*  Ukraine going into this, they mentioned as we just discussed here, they want some future [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=150.82s)]
*  security here and certainly the Euros providing peacekeeping forces a step in that direction. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=155.92s)]
*  But listen, here's what we do know, Brian. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=162.18s)]
*  If we get a deal and there is ceasefire and some kind of an agreement, Putin will look [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=164.78s)]
*  at that as a temporary pause. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=170.54s)]
*  In the meantime, China, Iran and North Korea will continue to arm him. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=172.26s)]
*  Sanctions relief likely will take place. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  That'll give him the opportunity to recover his defense industrial base. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=181.06s)]
*  President Zelensky knows this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=185.14s)]
*  The Trump team know this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=186.73999999999998s)]
*  What else could we do then to strengthen Ukraine to deter Putin? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=188.42s)]
*  We can help him build an F-16 air force, give him long-range missiles, air defense systems, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=193.6s)]
*  artillery weapons, all the things that we've done that have helped to make a difference, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=201.14s)]
*  just not in time to be decisive by the Biden administration, more tanks and armored vehicles. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=204.77999999999997s)]
*  The Trump team can come up with their own list with Zelensky, but just to give our audience [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=209.89999999999998s)]
*  a feel for what that would take place. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=214.82s)]
*  And guess what, Brian, there's no reason for the American taxpayers to spend $1 on this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=217.17999999999998s)]
*  The brilliant journalist Mark Thiessen and I wrote an op-ed about this deal that's coming [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=223.5s)]
*  right now on rare minerals, but also using Russian frozen assets. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=228.3s)]
*  And the State Department can issue loans. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=232.4s)]
*  They just issued a foreign military funding loan to Poland, $11 billion. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=235.14000000000001s)]
*  It's a loan. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  What is Poland going to do with that? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  Build up their defense industrial base. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  We can do much the same with Ukraine and take the American taxpayer off the table, but strengthen [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=246.3s)]
*  Ukraine in terms of their own security to deter a future attack from Russia, which Zelensky [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=252.7s)]
*  knows will come at some point. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=260.86s)]
*  So interesting because you could tell Putin, yeah, if you want that hard line, if you walk [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=263.5s)]
*  away from the table, you're not going to like what's going to happen in Ukraine. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=268.46s)]
*  So there's going to be a price to pay. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=272.5s)]
*  Also does he want to alienate Donald Trump, the first months of an administration, who [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=274.26s)]
*  he's got to deal with for the next four years? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=278.3s)]
*  The question is how much pain is Vladimir Putin and his country in? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=280.58s)]
*  General, I just love talking to you about it because you're right at the tip of the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=284.02s)]
*  spear. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=286.97999999999996s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=287.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, great talking to you, Brian. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=288.97999999999996s)]
*  You and the team have a wonderful weekend. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=291.26s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvEkGXwo8g&t=292.74s)]
