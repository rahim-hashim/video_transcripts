# 'FIRED UP': Lawrence Jones tours southern border with Hegseth, Homan
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE)
*  All right, our Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=0.0s)]
*  making his first trip yesterday to the border [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=2.96s)]
*  since he was confirmed. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=5.38s)]
*  And Lawrence joined him and our border czar, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=6.5s)]
*  Tom Homan down in El Paso. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=9.14s)]
*  Hey, Lawrence. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=10.96s)]
*  Hey, good morning, family. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=13.36s)]
*  It was a lecture day yesterday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=14.24s)]
*  We were here in Texas. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=15.8s)]
*  We went to New Mexico. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=17.16s)]
*  Also, the Secretary of Defense could get briefings [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=18.86s)]
*  of what's happening at our southern border. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=21.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  The border security is national security. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=26.24s)]
*  That's what it's all about. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=29.24s)]
*  And then also to see the troops. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=30.08s)]
*  This is what we're gonna do everywhere we go. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=32.08s)]
*  Here at home, overseas, see the troops, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=33.96s)]
*  make sure they're locked in on their mission, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=36.08s)]
*  make sure they know how much we appreciate what they do. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=37.66s)]
*  That's what the President wants. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=40.2s)]
*  It's what the American people voted for. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=41.28s)]
*  And we're gonna deliver it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=43.16s)]
*  All right, Mr. Secretary, we'll follow your lead. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=44.2s)]
*  So we just touched down to the US military hangar [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=46.08s)]
*  to talk with the troops. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=49.0s)]
*  So what y'all are doing right now, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=50.0s)]
*  we're gonna talk to the US military. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=52.04s)]
*  Y'all are doing right now is the front lines. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  We're gonna head into the chopper [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=56.76s)]
*  and go get a view of the border from the sky. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  So Mr. Secretary, I have the meetings been so far [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  as you've been talking with your command staff [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=64.56s)]
*  about getting this border secured and ready [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=66.56s)]
*  to do the half the tools necessary already. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=68.56s)]
*  You know, it's been incredible to watch the military respond [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=71.52s)]
*  to the awful orders of the Commander in Chief. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=74.96s)]
*  There's been no hesitation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=78.84s)]
*  There's been full integration, a belief in the mission. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=80.84s)]
*  You know, our generation has spent 20 years [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=84.8s)]
*  guarding other people's borders [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  while watching an invasion of our own. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=89.44s)]
*  And the great people, the Border Patrol, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=92.0s)]
*  and DHS and ICE have done the best they can. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=94.08s)]
*  But nobody can bring assets to bear [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=97.08s)]
*  like the Defense Department, nobody. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=100.4s)]
*  If the military is not able to be used [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=102.24s)]
*  to defend our own country, then what is it for? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=105.28s)]
*  You can have your men and women there. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  What happens if they get bum-rushed [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  or someone fires on them? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=112.24s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=115.04s)]
*  It's one of the first ones we've powered, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=116.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=118.76s)]
*  At some level, it's got wheels of engagement [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=119.76s)]
*  or what's the standing order if engaged. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=123.08s)]
*  And it really, remember the question, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=125.8s)]
*  obviously, always troops will be able to defend themselves. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  And if fired upon, you can and will fire back. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=131.88s)]
*  We're not putting a sitting dust on the border. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=136.64s)]
*  So we'll stand back for the tour. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=139.28s)]
*  We'll be closer down the end of the wall. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=141.76s)]
*  How much slack time do you anticipate [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=143.32s)]
*  before wall construction can recommence? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=145.32s)]
*  We're actually getting started a lot [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=149.04s)]
*  with the things that we've heard in the past. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=150.28s)]
*  You don't have to wait for the reconciliation bill [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=151.84s)]
*  from Congress or anything. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=155.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=156.48s)]
*  We literally have funding from 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=157.48s)]
*  That funding is going to be in steps [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=163.08s)]
*  on projects that were offered [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=165.08s)]
*  by our big, big districts. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=167.16s)]
*  So we just finished a briefing with the Secretary of Defense, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=169.04s)]
*  Chief of Border Patrol, as well as the Border Czar. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=171.56s)]
*  The moment that they get in and wait for another Biden, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=174.36s)]
*  they're going to home. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=177.04s)]
*  We're going to secure the border [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=178.36s)]
*  that this country is realizing a lot safer. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=179.8s)]
*  Do you two gentlemen's commitment [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=181.48s)]
*  that by the end of this four years, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=184.2s)]
*  and I know you both, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=187.76s)]
*  I know the president has confidence in you both, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=189.04s)]
*  that we will have, for the first time in American history, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=190.96s)]
*  operational control of the border? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=193.8s)]
*  Is that a promise y'all can keep? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=196.48s)]
*  I mean, more suited than that, if it takes that long, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=198.28s)]
*  we're not doing our job right. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=201.0s)]
*  We're not waiting four years. We're going to get this done. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=202.16s)]
*  Tom's going to go find him internally. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=204.44s)]
*  We're going to prevent him from coming in in the first place. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=206.36s)]
*  And between that, we're going to secure the country [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=208.4s)]
*  because that is national security. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=210.4s)]
*  A report is out that says that the Mexican cartel [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=212.60000000000002s)]
*  plans on using drones [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=216.36s)]
*  as well as firing upon our agents and military. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=218.12s)]
*  If this were to happen, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=222.12s)]
*  what would be the response of something like this? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, obviously not going to stand for that, Lawrence. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=227.76s)]
*  The most powerful military in the world [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=230.72s)]
*  will not be intimidated by anybody, let alone cartels. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=232.4s)]
*  It's not a question of if. It's what. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=235.96s)]
*  It's going to happen. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=238.88s)]
*  The president tried to designate a terrorist organization [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=240.16s)]
*  with a put out business that makes billions of dollars [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=242.28s)]
*  and I can't go quietly. It will be violent. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=244.68s)]
*  It looks like Mexico has, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=246.76s)]
*  they've caved to the tear threat [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=249.2s)]
*  from the president of the United States, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=251.28s)]
*  saying that if they did not stop the fentanyl [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=253.0s)]
*  and the legals coming across the border, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=257.28s)]
*  that there was going to be a tear upon them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=258.84s)]
*  They have since come to a temporary negotiation. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=260.52s)]
*  Yeah, we have no better negotiator at the helm [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  than our commander in chief, Donald Trump. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  The military here has the assets. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=268.23999999999995s)]
*  The mission is clear. We will secure that border. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=270.11999999999995s)]
*  Nothing's going to intimidate us or back us off that challenge. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=273.0s)]
*  And if we have to be even more proactive, we will be. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=275.67999999999995s)]
*  This is national security. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=278.52s)]
*  When we secure the border, less people die from fentanyl, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=280.08s)]
*  less women, children, sex traffic, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=283.28s)]
*  less people on terrorist watches across that border. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=285.08s)]
*  This is a national security issue. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=287.64s)]
*  President Trump can shut it down. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=289.24s)]
*  And guys, I was with the Secretary of Defense [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=296.24s)]
*  all day yesterday. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=298.84s)]
*  The one thing that did not make air [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  that I think the audience would like to know about [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=302.79999999999995s)]
*  is when I talk with the troops, the fire that's in his belly, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=304.64s)]
*  you see it in the rank and file. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=309.12s)]
*  They're excited about doing their job and hunting down bad guys. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  That's what they signed up to do. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=315.48s)]
*  They didn't sign up to be babysitters, change diapers. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=317.12s)]
*  There's a place for people to do that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=320.56s)]
*  It's not the military. It's not the Border Patrol. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  A great report, a great ride along. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=326.76s)]
*  Lawrence, I got a question for you. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=328.8s)]
*  At the top of the program, we were talking a little bit [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=330.48s)]
*  about how the cartels apparently are going to have kamikaze drones [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=332.32s)]
*  that are going to go ahead and target our Border Patrol, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=335.36s)]
*  and by extension, also our service personnel over there. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=338.16s)]
*  If they know that there is a cartel with a base [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=342.6s)]
*  where they're launching drones or they're shooting at our guys, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=347.12s)]
*  let's say 100 yards into Mexico or a mile into Mexico, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=350.32s)]
*  at what point does the United States military say, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  you know what, time to take you out? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=357.2s)]
*  Well, I think the president will respond by what he's always said, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=361.92s)]
*  you harm any American, you shoot at any American, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=366.12s)]
*  there will be a response. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  Just words of the wise for the cartel, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  because I sat through some of the unclassified briefing yesterday, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=372.03999999999996s)]
*  they know exactly where they are. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=375.84s)]
*  They know where the leadership is. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=377.84s)]
*  During the past administration, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=379.76s)]
*  one of the things the president wanted is to do military strikes, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=381.76s)]
*  military operations on those, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=384.96s)]
*  and then you had some of the four stars [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=387.36s)]
*  in the Secretary of Defense at the time [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=388.84s)]
*  that didn't want to carry out that plan. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=390.76s)]
*  Well, there's a new Secretary of Defense, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=393.08000000000004s)]
*  there are new four stars, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=394.76000000000005s)]
*  and they will be carrying out those missions. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=396.12s)]
*  You know, Lawrence, you did an excellent job, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=398.0s)]
*  and when I see you on the border riding a horse with Kristi Noem, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=399.64000000000004s)]
*  I see you walking around with Tom Homan and with Pete Hegseth, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=402.72s)]
*  and then we see Marco Rubio with Maduro, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=406.16s)]
*  and we see him with the president of El Salvador. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  We know our president is going to sit down with Netanyahu. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=410.72s)]
*  This just shows strength. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  That's what comes to mind when I see these images. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  And you feel it as well, Ainsley. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=419.44s)]
*  First of all, it's an incredible honor [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=422.16s)]
*  to be with the newly elected officials, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=424.24s)]
*  to hear the stories, to hear the plans, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=426.76s)]
*  but it's also an honor to be with the rank and file, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  to see the spirit, to see the fire in their belly. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=432.0s)]
*  I mean, we got some great men and women [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=435.40000000000003s)]
*  that are very good at their jobs, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=438.6s)]
*  and I got to see some of the technology. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=440.6s)]
*  For the cartel, you have drones, our drones are bigger. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=443.04s)]
*  You have weapons, our weapons are bigger. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=445.68s)]
*  The spirit, the weaponry, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=448.08000000000004s)]
*  and as well as the leadership is stronger in America, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=450.16s)]
*  and I hope our audience got to see that [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=454.12s)]
*  through our packages over the last couple days. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  Indeed, and you've got more with the troops coming up, Lawrence. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=458.04s)]
*  Great job down there in El Paso. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=461.08000000000004s)]
*  Very nicely done. Yes. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js8rZH_EQgE&t=463.08000000000004s)]
