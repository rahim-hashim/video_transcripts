# 'Absentee landlord' AOC takes heat as district sees gangs and crime
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4)
*  Well, local leaders in the parts of Queens that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez represents [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=0.0s)]
*  are calling on FBI Director Cash Patel to take on the crimes and the gangs. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=5.8s)]
*  That they say is getting worse. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  All of this is getting worse despite a massive NYPD crackdown that started last year and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=13.98s)]
*  resulted in hundreds being arrested. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=18.88s)]
*  Here to discuss is Republican candidate for New York City Council of District 25, Ramsey's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=21.28s)]
*  Frias. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=26.44s)]
*  Ramsey, so great to have you on. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=27.76s)]
*  I'm going to show you, I was in your district with you at some points. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=29.84s)]
*  Let's take a look at this flashback so we can show people what her district looks like. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=35.08s)]
*  After 7 p.m., you cannot walk around here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  In the corner, every like a week, you heard like somebody was killed, somebody was like [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=47.2s)]
*  beaten. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=53.6s)]
*  I feel very unsafe, truly. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=54.6s)]
*  I've had three times someone tried to assault me, tried to pull my gold chain. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=58.44s)]
*  So Ramsey's, you live there, I was there just about a month ago. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=63.76s)]
*  Same thing, I saw some of the same stuff. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=67.44s)]
*  She's out fighting the oligarchy. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=70.56s)]
*  She's on a tour with Bernie Sanders in like Wyoming and all over, and California. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=72.12s)]
*  What's happening in your district? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=77.88s)]
*  Why isn't she there? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=78.88s)]
*  She's an absentee landlord. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=80.52s)]
*  She never comes around. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=84.14s)]
*  She doesn't want to face the facts that this community is going under. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=85.4s)]
*  We are facing so many issues from prostitution, violent crime, gangs are just taking over [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=90.84s)]
*  our streets, putting their tags up everywhere, and making things so uncomfortable for all [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=97.68s)]
*  of our community members. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, let's talk about the prostitution, because when I was there, I was there at 9 [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=105.28s)]
*  in the morning. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=109.68s)]
*  Until around 1130, and I saw dozens of tricks being turned there. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=111.64s)]
*  I don't understand why she's fighting the oligarchy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  Why doesn't she fight the pimps who are exploiting the women in that district? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=119.2s)]
*  It was very sad, very young girls that I saw involved in this trade. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  Also, she's been fighting deep fake porn, because I guess that happened to her. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  She doesn't care about the pornography on her own streets. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=131.36s)]
*  It's just horrible. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  Human trafficking is at an all time high in our area, and it's almost as if the politicians [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=136.36s)]
*  in the area are trying to make it legal and make it a regular thing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=142.52s)]
*  We're trying to stop this at all costs. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=147.52s)]
*  That's such a great point, Ransy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=150.28s)]
*  She actually calls in sex workers. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=151.88s)]
*  She's trying to normalize the exploitation of women by pimps and so forth. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=153.96s)]
*  No woman wants to be in that trade. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=159.76s)]
*  No woman chooses to walk the streets at 9 o'clock in the morning turning tricks. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=161.48s)]
*  It's ludicrous for her to say that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=167.11999999999998s)]
*  The other thing that was happening was just straight up crime and women not feeling safe [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  walking the streets. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=174.32s)]
*  Those interviews that I saw were in October. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=177.2s)]
*  You see right there a lot of the illegal immigrants starting businesses there on the streets while [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  business owners had to work their whole lives to pay for a license to sell alcohol when [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  somebody's selling alcohol on the streets. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=192.6s)]
*  How is the business community reacting and what is the situation of the citizens? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=196.0s)]
*  Are they actually asking AOC to account for why there's so much neglect in her district? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=199.64s)]
*  The citizens are met with muted answers. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=207.92s)]
*  No one responds to us. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=212.38s)]
*  If you reach out to her office, nobody's saying anything. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=213.88s)]
*  Same issue is going on with other politicians in the area. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=217.4s)]
*  Our businesses are suffering. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=221.48s)]
*  A lot of doors are closing and then the doors that are opening are just more brothels. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=222.84s)]
*  These are the things that this community does not need. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=227.68s)]
*  You're running for office against AOC. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=231.0s)]
*  What's your message to the people in your district? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=232.8s)]
*  Well, I'm running for city council district 25 and that's versus Shekhar Krishnan. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=234.72s)]
*  And what I have to do is try my best to restore the balance here and bring back a community [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=241.0s)]
*  that's well loved and has so much to offer. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=248.12s)]
*  We're tired of being stepped on. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=252.6s)]
*  We're tired of being used. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=253.6s)]
*  And we just want to live peaceful and tranquil lives just like everyone else. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=256.0s)]
*  Everyone here wants the American dream. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=260.92s)]
*  That woman in the video said she only cares about her Washington and her money. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=263.6s)]
*  The first woman that we interviewed. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=267.56s)]
*  That's what she had told me. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=268.92s)]
*  Let's see if she makes it to our district and starts doing some work there instead of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=270.6s)]
*  fighting the oligarchy out in Wyoming and California. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=273.68s)]
*  Ramsey, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=277.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=280.08s)]
*  God bless you all. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=281.08s)]
*  We reached out, by the way, to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's office for a statement. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=282.88s)]
*  We haven't heard back. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_NltP0Thn4&t=287.24s)]
