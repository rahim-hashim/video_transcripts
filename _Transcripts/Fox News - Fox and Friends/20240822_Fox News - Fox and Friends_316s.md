# Trump team trolls Kamala Harris with 'campaign' website
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4)
*  At one point, Tim Walz acknowledged that now that there is a new ticket in town, they have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=0.0s)]
*  work ahead to explain to the American people not just who they are, but what they represent [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=5.86s)]
*  and what they're going to do if they win. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  We've got a chance to make Kamala Harris the next president of the United States. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=14.92s)]
*  We owe it to the American people to tell them exactly what she'd do as president before [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=19.2s)]
*  we ask them for their votes. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Now ironically, Walz kind of loosely outlined four general plans, including cutting taxes [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=28.32s)]
*  and protecting American freedoms. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=35.32s)]
*  We didn't get a whole lot more meat on the bone, and the Trump campaign is trolling the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=38.4s)]
*  new ticket. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=42.36s)]
*  They yesterday launched a Kamala 2024 policy website that actually leads to an error page [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=43.36s)]
*  because the campaign has still at this point nothing policy-wise written on it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=50.6s)]
*  So that was a little jab there, guys. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=56.24s)]
*  Yeah, so thank you so much for that report. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  Thanks, Jackie. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I just logged onto it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  It's kamalat 2024policies.com, and it says Kamala Harris's dangerous policies are nothing [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=63.08s)]
*  to laugh about, and you can play a video of some sound bites of her over the years and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=69.88s)]
*  what she has told reporters about her policies, and then you go through and it'll tell you [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=74.66s)]
*  each of her policies, then you can click on that to learn more information. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=79.32s)]
*  Because if they're not going to put out their policies, you've got to go by in her record [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=82.68s)]
*  and having gotten the job as vice president. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=86.52s)]
*  So let's take a look at it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=89.24s)]
*  Fadi said murder is free, more binomics, it's working. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=90.24s)]
*  Remember how many times she said that? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=93.6s)]
*  You'll see it eclipse more taxes to ensure the middle class pays their fair share because [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=95.64s)]
*  people mischaracterize the Trump tax plan as a break for the rich. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=100.64s)]
*  They got a 1% decrease. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=104.6s)]
*  Most of the middle class are the ones who saw the tax increase, the tax decrease. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=107.24s)]
*  You can see other policies there, ending wrong-headed thinking that police, that more police means [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  safer communities, in other words, her policies, would take police off the street. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=117.52s)]
*  There is an idea in politics, Lawrence, define yourself or somebody else will define you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=122.56s)]
*  And right here, this is the Trump campaign defining Kamala Harris when it comes to substance, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=128.32s)]
*  when it comes to policy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=132.8s)]
*  But using her own words. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=133.8s)]
*  And look at the last one. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=134.8s)]
*  Well, meaning she hasn't put out any specific policies as this campaign for presidency, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=136.4s)]
*  but this is her past, as we point out, Brian, put in the terms of Kamala 2024 policies. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, they keep telling us that there's this new Kamala Harris. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=145.68s)]
*  Okay, well then the new Kamala Harris needs to show up. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the governor says on the stage that we owe it to the voters to go tell them out, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=153.68s)]
*  tell them where she stands on it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  No, she owes it to us. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=160.8s)]
*  She owes it to us. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=162.44s)]
*  All we see is campaign syriacists telling us the evolution of Kamala Harris, not Kamala [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=163.44s)]
*  Harris telling us. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=168.88s)]
*  And she's changed on her position, which politicians do all the time. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=169.88s)]
*  I think that's totally fine. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  But she needs to be able to tell us why she changed it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=175.6s)]
*  What's the actual policy and what she's going to do? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=178.12s)]
*  They keep saying there was this evolution because she was in the vice president's office. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=181.4s)]
*  Okay, tell us about that evolution then. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=185.64s)]
*  Lawrence, if you go on this, it's very thorough. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=187.64s)]
*  If you click on the first one, which is fighting to set murderers free, it talks about her [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=190.68s)]
*  supporting the Minnesota Freedom Fund, talks about how criminals were let out. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=195.5s)]
*  One of them that was let out went on to commit a murder. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  It talks about different dates and when she co-sponsored certain bills. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=203.2s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  Did you see the cover of the New York Post today? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, this is the story of that murderer. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  Harris helped bail group out, raise millions to let loose murderers. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=212.0s)]
*  And they tell you about this story. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=215.83999999999997s)]
*  These guys, they got out again and they kill again. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=217.22s)]
*  And she was one of the first George Soros style AGs. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=220.0s)]
*  Criminals are good. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=225.83999999999997s)]
*  Let's let them run wild. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=226.83999999999997s)]
*  We see the remedy for games she's at in Chicago. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=228.28s)]
*  We certainly see it in New York, nonstop. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=230.52s)]
*  This is the most important stuff in this election. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=234.46s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=236.62s)]
*  What are your policies? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  I had Trey Gowdy on the Will Cain show this week and he was like, Republicans win when [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  they talk about policies. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=242.12s)]
*  We're going to lose if we talk ad hominem. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=243.12s)]
*  If you talk about the candidates and their personalities. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  But I do have to say, because they've made it a central tenet of this election, Democrats, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=247.44s)]
*  this idea of who's weird, right? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=252.60000000000002s)]
*  I'm just going to tell you, when Tim Waltz walks out on stage with a double hand wave [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  above his head, and look, it's hard to fill a room when you're giving a speech, like, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=258.2s)]
*  how do I match the energy? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=261.68s)]
*  But all these exaggerated motions, I'm going to say. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=263.2s)]
*  Kicking the air. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=265.52s)]
*  I'm going to tell you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=266.52s)]
*  Have you seen him kick the air? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=267.52s)]
*  He always lifts his leg up. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=268.52s)]
*  I'm just going to say it's weird. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=269.52s)]
*  That's one man's opinion, but that in the football coach, that's weird. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=272.52s)]
*  I didn't have that coach. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  I will say this, if I brought up to dawn that I liked a honeymoon in China with students, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  that would have been a stop sign. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=283.28s)]
*  No marriage, right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=286.67999999999995s)]
*  That would have been the perfect Hollywood sign. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=287.67999999999995s)]
*  You all could have talked trade in China. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=289.67999999999995s)]
*  I know, going to communist China was never on my punch guard. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=292.67999999999995s)]
*  But that's what he did. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  Is that not weird? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=299.23999999999995s)]
*  At the very least, I never thought it was a big deal to be a little different in this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=300.23999999999995s)]
*  country, but they're running on it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmmObgpIfg4&t=305.84s)]
