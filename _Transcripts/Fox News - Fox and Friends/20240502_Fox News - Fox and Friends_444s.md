# UCLA student rips university for handling of encampment: 'Doing absolutely nothing'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI)
*  Let's bring in campus reform correspondent and UCLA student Justin Choi. Justin, what's your reaction to what's unfolding on your campus right now? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I was there last night at the UCLA protest at around 1130 p.m. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=8.24s)]
*  Prime time and the first thing I heard was I heard protesters screaming UCLA divest in the river to the sea [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=13.56s)]
*  Intifada keep the Zionists out and I heard a lot of these pro-palestinian protesters [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=19.92s)]
*  First of all, they're plotting how to keep these students and even UCLA students out from entering their own encampment [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=24.88s)]
*  and I was able to hear this because I was [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=30.66s)]
*  At my scooter and I was in front of the barrier and I heard these students talking about that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=33.16s)]
*  And there's also one guy who was carrying a huge wooden stick. I guess sort of in a way to exert power [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  And you know a lot of people I've spoke to not just students [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=43.28s)]
*  But also adults around the campus are they're very scared right now to go around and you know [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=46.54s)]
*  Just a lot of these people are kind of are giving them a hard time with whether or not you're trying to get the class [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=50.4s)]
*  And what not let's talk about the breakdown of students and I'm not looking for exact numbers [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=55.96s)]
*  It's really a guesstimate [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=60.2s)]
*  But what percentage would you say of your fellow UCLA students and there are tens of thousands of them [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=61.08s)]
*  support the protests that you're seeing on campus right now, I [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=66.72s)]
*  Think it's around. I think it's around 40% of planning completely honest [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=71.24s)]
*  It's probably fit 40 to 50 percent and I think a lot of the people who are supporting [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=75.8s)]
*  These whole movement and this whole movement is maybe half of them are actually for Palestine [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=80.4s)]
*  But I think a lot of them are also in this because of the trends we were seeing on tick-tock, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  I mean we saw what happened in the 2020 BLM riots [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=90.2s)]
*  I love these people kind of saw what's happening and what was trending on tick-tock and on social media [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=93.2s)]
*  So they decided to go out and protest [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=98.0s)]
*  So I think a lot that a lot of that has to do with that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=99.64000000000001s)]
*  But I also do believe a large crunch of them is also out there because they genuinely believe that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=101.68s)]
*  Palestine it's under attack. Can you believe that this encampment is still standing 24 hours after the riot broke out? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=107.96s)]
*  What are your thoughts on the college administration and how they're handling all of this? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=115.56s)]
*  No, it's still crazy [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  I think [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=123.72s)]
*  UCLA has been very weak but dealing with the protesters because buildings have been graffitied and it's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=124.84s)]
*  Distrupting with students and classes and regular students who want to enter a building [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=130.84s)]
*  I know you guys had a come a Jewish student on a couple days ago [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=134.48s)]
*  But he was not able to enter a building because they were not because he just because he was Jewish, right? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=137.48s)]
*  and so UCLA should be doing a lot better and when violence happened last night with [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=142.4s)]
*  During the protest last night around 1 a.m [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=147.88s)]
*  It's an LAPD around three three more hours after the whole event for them to even come in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=150.92s)]
*  So I think UCLA should have done a much better job in stopping this to begin with and also whatever on reporters a daily [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=155.94s)]
*  Brunpour was attacked for no reason and you know [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=163.28s)]
*  And I think that's because UCLA was doing absolutely nothing and to that point there have been calls for [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  Chancellor gene block to resign but you have to understand how the UC system works [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  Yes, there's some man in charge in this case gene block, but they're also the regents and Justin [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=177.32s)]
*  I have not heard a thing from them. Have you I? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  I [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=186.2s)]
*  Have not either um we just got a statement from the Chancellor this afternoon around 3 p.m [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  Prime Pacific time and so and that was kind of late in my opinion [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=193.6s)]
*  That was honestly around 24 hours after the whole violence broke out last night [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=197.32s)]
*  around Royce also the Chancellor has been [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=201.96s)]
*  Complacent it's been taking him so long for him to even issue a statement [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=205.8s)]
*  And I've heard nothing from the regions as well [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=209.0s)]
*  Well, we just saw somebody holding a banner that said a UCLA faculty we stand with our students and that it's in the encampment as [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=211.48s)]
*  Police are potentially closing in on this thing [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=219.04s)]
*  What's your experience with the professors? What has that been like? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=222.12s)]
*  Yes, I do know that a lot of the professors are out there supporting the pro-palestinian side [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=226.52s)]
*  But even before that a lot of the professors here are you know? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=232.96s)]
*  I wouldn't say a large portion of them, but a few of them definitely have their own agendas when it comes to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  indoctrinating children docking college students [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  And so it's really not a surprise to see some college professors out there [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  But I hope that things will get settled down pretty quickly, but Justin once this is over [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  How do you and more importantly how do your fellow? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=255.16s)]
*  Jewish students go back into a classroom with one of these professors because this goes well beyond [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=258.98s)]
*  Oh, I have to take a class with a professor who doesn't share my point of view [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=265.16s)]
*  That's what college is supposed to be you're supposed to learn from divergent points of view [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  These professors are advocating at the end of the day for violence [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=273.68s)]
*  So how can you head into a classroom with Professor X in a couple of weeks if not next semester and and learn from this individual? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=277.48s)]
*  No, absolutely. I mean Jewish students and later on the future are scared [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=287.12s)]
*  I absolutely sympathize with them [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  But I think what the university needs to do is they need to be more strict whether it's law enforcement or whether it's their own policies [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  UCLA needs to be strict in terms of how they deal with these people [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=298.96s)]
*  And everyone has a right to free speech everyone has the right to protest, but people who actively call for [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=302.84s)]
*  violence people who are out there saying [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=309.52s)]
*  Stuff like anti-fata, you know [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  UCLA has to be stronger and stricter and show the world and just show to our students that we cannot stand for that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=314.64s)]
*  I think that's an important first step that UCLA must take and just to get a sense of what these [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=319.92s)]
*  Protesters believe in what they want. They they've released a list of demands their demands include [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=325.2s)]
*  divestment [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  withdrawal all UC wide and UCLA Foundation funds from companies and institutions that are complicit in the Israeli occupation [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  Those those are their words [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=338.76s)]
*  Disclose provide full transparency to all about investments donations and grants and then their last demand [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=340.8s)]
*  Justin is abolish policing and the targeted repression and policing of pro-palestinian [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=347.76s)]
*  Advocacy on campus. So yesterday this is according to Bill Mollusk and our reporter who's down there among the protesters right now [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  He said the anti-israel protesters at UCLA just held a press conference [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=360.28s)]
*  Where they said that they were victims of a life-threatening assault at the hands of Zionists last night [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=364.4s)]
*  They complained that police didn't do enough to intervene. However, their demands include [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=369.32s)]
*  Abolishing police. What's your reaction to that? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=374.8s)]
*  Yeah, I was just talking about it with some people around me [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  But earlier today in the afternoon actually the pro-palestinian protesters held a press conference [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=382.12s)]
*  Asking why there weren't enough police presence and that the police should have done more to ensure violence [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=386.88s)]
*  but that's kind of funny because it could it contradicts the previous demand like you guys said of defunding the police and their chance of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  ACAB, which I probably won't say on my television. All cops are you know, and I would have to say that last part [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=399.84s)]
*  It's kind of funny because that literally contradicts their previous demands of defunding the police and abolishing you [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=405.0s)]
*  So it's it's funny. And I mean it's crazy if you want to know the truth Justin [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=410.92s)]
*  I'm sorry you have to deal with this [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=415.48s)]
*  Unfortunately, this isn't like one of those schools like Columbia where they're gonna get graduation in a couple of days to basically end all this [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=416.68s)]
*  You're on the trimester. You got to deal with weeks more of this. You guys don't graduate until June [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=423.24s)]
*  So I'm sorry you have to deal with this. It looks like there's no end in sight at least for a while [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=427.92s)]
*  Just enjoy best of luck. Stay safe. I'm Steve Ducey [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=431.56s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade and I'm Ainsley Earhart and click here to subscribe to the Fox News YouTube page to catch our hottest interviews and most [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cIDeWRYVI&t=434.48s)]
