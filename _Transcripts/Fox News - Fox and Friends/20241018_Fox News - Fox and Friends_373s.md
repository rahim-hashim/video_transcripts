# ‘YOU BLEW IT’: Harris dinged for Al Smith dinner flub
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM)
*  You know speaking to Chuck Schumer, Donald Trump last night was very gracious when he [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=0.0s)]
*  How weird was that? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=4.48s)]
*  He said he called Chuck Schumer a good man. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=5.48s)]
*  He called the Democrat governor of New York State, Kathy Hochulz, said you're doing a [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=8.46s)]
*  good job, not easy, but you're doing all right. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=12.66s)]
*  He said there was a wide range of jokes and other comments. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  And if you missed it, here's a little taste of what the former president said last night [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=21.98s)]
*  right here in Midtown Manhattan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=27.86s)]
*  The Catholic Church are helping the poor, educating children and supporting the vulnerable. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=29.66s)]
*  But if you really wanted Vice President Harris to accept your invitation, I guess you should [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=37.06s)]
*  have told her the funds were going to bail out the looters and rioters in Minneapolis [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=41.260000000000005s)]
*  and she would have been here guaranteed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=48.38s)]
*  She would have been here guaranteed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=50.22s)]
*  It's a true pleasure to be with you this evening. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=56.74s)]
*  Amazing pleasure. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=58.82s)]
*  And these days it's really a pleasure anywhere in New York without a subpoena for my appearance. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=60.940000000000005s)]
*  Anytime I don't get a subpoena, I'm very happy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=71.82000000000001s)]
*  But unfortunately, Governor Walz isn't here himself, but don't worry, he'll say that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=76.38s)]
*  he was. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=81.34s)]
*  But I have to be careful, however, to understand that this will be the first time in the history [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=82.34s)]
*  of this event where jokes will be fact checked, and they will be. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=92.30000000000001s)]
*  All polls are indicating I'm leading big with the Catholic vote, as I should be, as I should [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=97.78s)]
*  be. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=104.26s)]
*  But I don't think Kamala has given up yet. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  She hasn't. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=108.34s)]
*  Kamala is attending tonight. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=109.34s)]
*  She's in Michigan receiving communion from Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=111.10000000000001s)]
*  I didn't like Biden very much, and now I like him quite a bit, you know. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=119.62s)]
*  And now I say that she's much worse than him. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=124.94s)]
*  He was in other votes that are coming and are coming in a very, very strong, a certain [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=128.66s)]
*  way. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=132.02s)]
*  I won't tell you what way that is, but Chuck Schumer is here looking very glum. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=133.02s)]
*  He's still glum. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=139.3s)]
*  He looks glum. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=140.3s)]
*  But look on the bright side, Chuck, considering how woke your party has become. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=144.02s)]
*  If Kamala loses, you still have a chance to become the first woman president. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=149.58s)]
*  You know, watching Chuck Schumer, and Chuck Schumer is down in the corner right above [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=155.9s)]
*  the Fox & Friends logo right there, he was pretty much... [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=163.18s)]
*  Anytime there was a joke at Kamala Harris's expense, just like that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=166.06s)]
*  But some of the other stuff, it kind of broke a smile. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=172.1s)]
*  I'll tell you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=174.82s)]
*  By the way, how great is Martha McCallum? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=175.82s)]
*  Well, I was going to say... [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=177.3s)]
*  Martha's in the back, and so is Maria. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=178.3s)]
*  Maria's in the back. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=179.3s)]
*  Maria bottom row, right over to the right. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=180.3s)]
*  Martha McCallum is in every shot because she is directly behind the speaker. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=182.1s)]
*  They loved Mayor Bloomberg when they said, oh, some people want you to run again. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  Everyone cheered. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  And then when Bill de Blasio walked out, he was the only one on the dais that was booed. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=192.42s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  It's just so interesting because it just seems like it was a funny event. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  People had a good time. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=202.5s)]
*  And you just wonder why she would skip something that could be such a layup to just galvanize [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=203.5s)]
*  people. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=209.77999999999997s)]
*  Didn't it bomb? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=210.77999999999997s)]
*  Didn't her video bomb? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=211.77999999999997s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=212.77999999999997s)]
*  It was the worst thing ever. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=213.77999999999997s)]
*  It was not appropriate. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=214.77999999999997s)]
*  And it was, well, I mean, the actress from Saturday Night Live that we grew up watching. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=215.77999999999997s)]
*  Molly Shannon. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=219.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=220.26s)]
*  It just, what did you think of that? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=221.26s)]
*  It totally bombed. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=222.98s)]
*  And no one was laughing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=223.98s)]
*  And there's probably like half, at least half the room with Democrats. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=225.66s)]
*  They would just look at each other. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=228.7s)]
*  Not funny, awkward, weird. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=229.7s)]
*  If you try to be funny, show them. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=232.22s)]
*  If you're going to give it an address. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=235.89999999999998s)]
*  You blew it by not showing up. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=236.89999999999998s)]
*  Just stay out of it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=238.66s)]
*  We've got a clip. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=239.66s)]
*  Here is Kamala Harris and Molly Shannon playing that Catholic school girl character, Mary [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=241.5s)]
*  Catherine Gallagher. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=246.94s)]
*  I think we're going to play it right here. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=249.73999999999998s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=251.54s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=252.54s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=253.54s)]
*  Just so you know, there will be a fact checker there tonight. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=254.54s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=256.38s)]
*  Who? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=257.97999999999996s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=258.97999999999996s)]
*  And maybe don't say anything negative about Catholics. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=259.97999999999996s)]
*  I would never do that, no matter where I was. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=262.3s)]
*  That would be like criticizing Detroit in Detroit. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=264.65999999999997s)]
*  Does it bother you that that Trump guy insults you all the time? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=268.82s)]
*  Because it really bothers my friends and me. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=271.34s)]
*  Oh, Mary Catherine, it's very important to always remember you should never let anyone [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=273.3s)]
*  tell you who you are. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=277.94s)]
*  You tell them who you are. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=279.78s)]
*  Well, see, had she been there, had they done that in person, you could have heard the laughter, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=281.5s)]
*  but it was just video. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=286.3s)]
*  So there was no laughter. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=287.3s)]
*  No, there wasn't any laughter. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=288.3s)]
*  In the big room? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=289.3s)]
*  No, no. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=290.66s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=291.66s)]
*  And half the room probably is voting for her. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=292.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=293.66s)]
*  I'll tell you what I noticed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm like, oh my gosh, Brian Kilmeade, Maria, Martha, Cardinal Dolan, President Trump and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=296.02s)]
*  Melania, obviously. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=302.22s)]
*  I'm like, oh my gosh, here's the owner of Home Depot. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=303.22s)]
*  Ken Langone was there. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=306.14s)]
*  And then you see Woody Johnson, who owns the Jets. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=308.21999999999997s)]
*  You're sitting next to the owner of the Giants. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=311.06s)]
*  Roger Goodell, the Commissioner. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=312.78s)]
*  I'm like, Robert Kraft, all the former mayors of New York. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=313.78s)]
*  It was like, wow, this is such a big deal. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=317.14s)]
*  She is missing an opportunity. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=320.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, political elite, business leaders and Catholic luminaries. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=322.18s)]
*  Kamala Harris is the first candidate to miss since Walter Mondale in 1992. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=326.46s)]
*  However, and I did not know this fact. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=332.46s)]
*  I saw this this morning. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=334.78s)]
*  No presidential candidates showed up in 1992, 1996 or 2004. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=336.26s)]
*  And the president did, President Trump did make a reference to that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=343.5s)]
*  He said, well, you know, Mondale, he was expected to do well. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=347.73999999999995s)]
*  It didn't work out. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=351.5s)]
*  It shows you there is a God. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=352.5s)]
*  And he kind of referenced, remember when he was like, I wouldn't miss this for the world [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=354.09999999999997s)]
*  because I kind of need the man upstairs. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=358.26s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQK2NAOCLLM&t=362.38s)]
