# 'SLAMMING THE DOORS': Biden accused of intentionally leaving Trump with foreign policy mess
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI)
*  Let's bring in KT McFarland, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=0.0s)]
*  former Trump Deputy National Security Advisor. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=2.64s)]
*  KT, great to see you this morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=5.46s)]
*  It's kind of curious because it seems like Syria [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=7.26s)]
*  had been kind of quiet for a number of years [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=11.72s)]
*  and then suddenly in the last couple of weeks, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=14.16s)]
*  it exploded. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=16.3s)]
*  Can you explain why that has happened [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=18.36s)]
*  over the last couple of weeks? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, all right, so Syria was governed by Assad [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  and he was weak and incompetent [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=26.84s)]
*  and he was propped up in governance in Syria [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=28.92s)]
*  by Iran and by Russia, by Russian forces, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=32.440000000000005s)]
*  by Russian military equipment, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=35.36s)]
*  by in some sense, Iran's money, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=36.88s)]
*  but they're preoccupied now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=39.2s)]
*  As President Trump so rightfully said, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=41.2s)]
*  Iran is preoccupied because of what Israel did [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  to Iran and Hezbollah and Russia is preoccupied [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  because of Ukraine and a faltering economy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=49.160000000000004s)]
*  So those two guys propping up Assad, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=51.56s)]
*  they were propping him up as well [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  and so the rebel groups, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=56.6s)]
*  and there's not one rebel group, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=57.84s)]
*  that's what's important to remember. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=59.2s)]
*  There are a lot of different rebel groups. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  There's Turkish backed ones, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=61.74s)]
*  there's an ISIS Al Qaeda rebel group. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=63.52s)]
*  We're even in the middle of it [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=65.72s)]
*  with 900 American forces backing another rebel group, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=66.88000000000001s)]
*  but the rebel groups got together [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=70.02000000000001s)]
*  and they saw a moment of opportunity [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=71.80000000000001s)]
*  and they moved into Syria. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=73.48s)]
*  And so now, who knows what's next? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=75.12s)]
*  And President Trump is so right to say, let it play out. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=77.72s)]
*  This is not our fight. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm just sorry we have 900 American forces in that country [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=83.16s)]
*  because who know, are they sitting targets? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=87.36s)]
*  Are they potential hostages? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=89.32s)]
*  What's their role going to be? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=90.88s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=92.44s)]
*  I agree, let it play out and we shouldn't be involved, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=93.52s)]
*  but if we're funding, Turkey is funding groups, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=95.92s)]
*  we're funding groups, Israel's funding groups, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=99.7s)]
*  we are involved. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=102.12s)]
*  So now what, KD? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=102.96s)]
*  Well, this is where you don't know what's gonna happen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=106.44s)]
*  In some ways, it's a very good thing [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=108.68s)]
*  because Russia's taken down a peg [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=110.44s)]
*  and Iran has taken down a peg. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=113.2s)]
*  Iran had used Syria to send weapons from Iran to Syria [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  into Iran's proxy forces around Israel. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=120.72s)]
*  So Israel's to an advantage, right? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=123.78s)]
*  Because they're not, their adversaries [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=125.84s)]
*  are not being resupplied. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=127.52s)]
*  Russia's down because Russia has military equipment there, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=128.96s)]
*  Russia had a port there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=131.96s)]
*  So that's all good in a sense, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=132.9s)]
*  but now you don't know what happens. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=135.04s)]
*  There's not, it's not as if there's a unified rebel group. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=136.44s)]
*  You could have fighting within the rebel groups. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=139.44s)]
*  You could, on the other hand, have rebel leaders who say, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=141.58s)]
*  I see the trend in the Middle East, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=144.64s)]
*  it's gonna be peace in the Middle East. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=146.28s)]
*  It's not Iran, we don't like Iran. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  We see that the future of the Middle East [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=149.82s)]
*  is Arab-Israeli peace agreements. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=151.76s)]
*  So you could have it the other extreme. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=154.32s)]
*  I mean, I was with Henry Kissinger Rachel [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  when he did the first 1973 peace, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  disengagement agreements after the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=161.76s)]
*  And Syria was always the hardest nut to crack. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=165.83999999999997s)]
*  Jordan, you could figure out Jordan, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=169.2s)]
*  you could figure out Egypt, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  you could figure out the Saudis, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  you could figure out Israel, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=173.66s)]
*  but Syria was always the hardest nut to crack [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=175.06s)]
*  because it's not one group. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=178.02s)]
*  It's not one ethnic group in Syria. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=179.74s)]
*  It's many ethnic groups, it's many tribes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=182.1s)]
*  And Bashar al-Assad's father was Haifa al-Assad, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=184.82s)]
*  he was head of it then, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=188.22s)]
*  but now you have nobody in charge. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=189.74s)]
*  Now that's a country that's been governed [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=191.46s)]
*  by one family for what, 60 years? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=192.7s)]
*  Not clear what happens next. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=195.42s)]
*  No, all the tribes, all the different ethnic groups [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=197.38s)]
*  fighting over who's gonna control this area, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=199.66s)]
*  that is basically underneath KT, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=201.98s)]
*  which you mentioned a moment ago, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=204.66s)]
*  which this becomes a mini version of the global game. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  Turkey, Iran, to some extent, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=208.73999999999998s)]
*  depending on their capabilities, Russia still, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  and the United States. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=214.1s)]
*  Excuse me, you mentioned Trump has said, let's stay out. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=215.78s)]
*  He put out a statement saying, let this play out, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  we're gonna stay out. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=220.7s)]
*  But as Rachel and you have both said, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=221.54s)]
*  well, we've got 900 troops already there, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=223.14s)]
*  we've been in this game. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=225.29999999999998s)]
*  So it seems to me that we have a choice. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=226.76s)]
*  We either remove those 900 troops, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=228.78s)]
*  because you pointed out, they're sitting ducks, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  they're targets to some extent now, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=233.54s)]
*  or we have to double down. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=236.66s)]
*  We have to go in more or pull out. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=237.86s)]
*  I don't know how maintaining the course is a realistic, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=240.02s)]
*  I hope, look, we all hope for a great outcome [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=243.66s)]
*  in minimal US investment. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=246.94s)]
*  I'm just not sure that hope is a realistic hope. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=248.74s)]
*  Or who we're investing in. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=251.82s)]
*  I don't know who the bad guys are, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=253.06s)]
*  who the worst guys are in this situation, KT. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=254.82s)]
*  Yeah, they're bad guys, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=260.14s)]
*  and then they're even badder guys. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=260.98s)]
*  I've got to assume President Trump knows what he's doing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=262.94s)]
*  And I've got to assume that at some point, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=265.38s)]
*  there'll be an ability to protect those American forces. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=267.56s)]
*  The greater thing is you take a step back [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=270.74s)]
*  in the Middle East, what's going on. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  And this was something that President Trump [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=274.5s)]
*  was right about in his first term. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=275.90000000000003s)]
*  The United States, because of our own energy, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  newly discovered and new technologies, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=279.82s)]
*  we now have enough oil and natural gas [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=282.82s)]
*  to power the entire world for hundreds of years. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=284.74s)]
*  Cheaper, safer, cleaner than any other country, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=288.1s)]
*  any other region of the world. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=291.26000000000005s)]
*  So the Middle East has been embroiled forever, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=293.1s)]
*  going back to the days of Jesus, if not before, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=296.22s)]
*  by just warfare between tribes. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=298.92s)]
*  But what made it important to the rest of the world [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=301.3s)]
*  was the oil. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=303.74s)]
*  And now that oil is far less important. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=304.74s)]
*  Syria doesn't have any oil, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=306.78000000000003s)]
*  but everybody else in the region does. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=307.90000000000003s)]
*  But now that the United States can replace the Middle East, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=309.86s)]
*  replace Russia as the world's energy hub, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=312.78000000000003s)]
*  as we have not only energy independence, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=315.82000000000005s)]
*  but energy dominance, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=317.62s)]
*  that part of the world becomes a very different place. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=319.5s)]
*  If they don't figure out, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=322.7s)]
*  those countries don't figure out some new game, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=324.06s)]
*  some new way of having a strong economy, they're toast. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=326.62s)]
*  And that was the genesis [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=330.5s)]
*  of President Trump's Abraham Accords. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=332.26s)]
*  So maybe this group, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=334.58s)]
*  if they can figure out who's in charge of this group, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=335.98s)]
*  maybe they can find a way to peace. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=338.22s)]
*  Maybe they'll just keep fighting each other [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=340.14s)]
*  and only time will tell. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=342.46s)]
*  Yeah, Katie, you make a great point on energy independence [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=343.94s)]
*  and just getting ourselves extricated [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=346.2s)]
*  from that part of the world, at least economically. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=347.88s)]
*  That makes us safer for sure. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=350.32s)]
*  You know, on the other hand, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=352.0s)]
*  you see Donald Trump in Paris, France, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  meeting with Zelensky, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=356.08s)]
*  and there's a real effort to wind down the war [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=357.52s)]
*  between Ukraine and Russia. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=361.64s)]
*  And yet we just saw that our government, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=363.48s)]
*  Lloyd Austin and Joe Biden, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  just gave a billion dollars to Ukraine. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=367.44s)]
*  So we want peace and we wanna wind it down, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=370.24s)]
*  but we just gave them a billion dollars. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=372.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, we have Americans living in tents [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=374.6s)]
*  in North Carolina. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=377.44s)]
*  You know, President Trump may wanna end that war, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=381.64000000000004s)]
*  but I think the Biden administration [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=384.12s)]
*  is going out of office days, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  is slamming the doors [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=388.16s)]
*  and trying to make that war even worse, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=389.48s)]
*  trying to make Donald Trump's job [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=391.12s)]
*  of negotiating a solution, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=393.32000000000005s)]
*  a negotiated solution even harder. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=395.6s)]
*  And you're right, it's, you know, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=397.70000000000005s)]
*  America first means America first. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  What are our interests in the region? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=400.92s)]
*  What's important to us? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  We should no longer ignore the needs [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  of the American people. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=406.20000000000005s)]
*  For some people in a country we can't even pronounce, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=407.12s)]
*  people can't find on a map, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=410.56s)]
*  and we don't know there's not a vital national interest [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=412.12s)]
*  to the United States. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=414.48s)]
*  Ending the Ukraine war, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=415.64000000000004s)]
*  President Trump will do it very quickly. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=416.84000000000003s)]
*  And as you can see, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=419.04s)]
*  Russia's on the ropes in a lot of ways, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=420.8s)]
*  Ukraine's on the ropes. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  He'll negotiate a solution very quickly. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=423.6s)]
*  But the thing about the Paris meeting, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=426.04s)]
*  that it was just stunning to me, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=428.8s)]
*  was the body language. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=430.0s)]
*  Compare it to where it was [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  when President Trump was first term. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=433.96000000000004s)]
*  Remember that picture. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  President Trump had been elevated, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=437.0s)]
*  like 30 countries were there, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=438.6s)]
*  and he was supposed to stand at the back [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=440.08000000000004s)]
*  and at the top for the photo op. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=441.8s)]
*  And he just elbowed his way, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  muscled his way down to the front row. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=445.40000000000003s)]
*  Love that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=447.36s)]
*  Cut his cuttings, said, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=448.24s)]
*  I'm here, let's take the picture. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=449.08000000000004s)]
*  And here you have a very different thing, right? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=450.64000000000004s)]
*  All the world leaders are rushing [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=452.72s)]
*  to try to stand next to him, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=454.76000000000005s)]
*  to get a photo op with him, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=455.96000000000004s)]
*  to whisper in his ear, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=457.04s)]
*  Donald Trump, America is so back. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=458.8s)]
*  It's great to see. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=460.88s)]
*  As you know better than anybody, KT, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump, most people would look at this situation [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=464.28s)]
*  and see, and be overwhelmed [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=466.68s)]
*  by all of the challenges facing our country. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  And Donald Trump is one of those guys, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=472.6s)]
*  he looks at that as an opportunity. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=473.88s)]
*  The more moving parts, the more you can negotiate. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=475.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=478.48s)]
*  You know, we're New Yorkers, I'm a New Yorker. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=481.28s)]
*  Donald Trump has had a reputation for 40 years [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=483.56s)]
*  as being one of the best negotiator deal guys [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=486.36s)]
*  in New York and in the country. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=489.92s)]
*  And he's shown in his first term, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=491.32s)]
*  even with the Russia investigation, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=494.08000000000004s)]
*  the impeachment and the deep state, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=496.0s)]
*  even then he was able to get Abraham Accords, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=498.68s)]
*  he was able to get trade agreements with China. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=501.04s)]
*  He was able to do an awful lot. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=503.72s)]
*  And so now that he'll be unencumbered, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  I think by a lot of that, sky's the limit. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=507.48s)]
*  America is gonna be in such great shape [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=510.16s)]
*  under President Trump, it's gonna be our golden era. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-suY-3asAI&t=513.0s)]
