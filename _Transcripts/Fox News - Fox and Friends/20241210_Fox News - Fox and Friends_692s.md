*  Brian Thompson, has now been officially charged. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Brooke Singh, that breaks it down for us, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=11.68s)]
*  for all we know, and we know a lot. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=13.44s)]
*  Brooke. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=15.6s)]
*  Yeah, we do, guys. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=16.42s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=17.26s)]
*  So the suspected killer remains behind bars [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=18.1s)]
*  in Pennsylvania this morning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=19.48s)]
*  Luigi Mangione, on your left here, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=21.04s)]
*  is now charged in the killing [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=23.04s)]
*  of United Healthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=24.44s)]
*  six days ago in Midtown Manhattan. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=26.94s)]
*  The suspect now faces several charges. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=29.16s)]
*  So in New York, he's been charged with second degree murder [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=31.28s)]
*  along with three other gun-related charges. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=34.2s)]
*  And in Pennsylvania, he faces five more charges, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=37.04s)]
*  including forgery, carrying a gun without a license, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=39.8s)]
*  and lying about his identity to officers. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=42.88s)]
*  His arrest came after a tip from a McDonald's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=45.7s)]
*  more than 230 miles from Manhattan in Altoona, Pennsylvania. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=48.36s)]
*  Authorities say the 26-year-old was carrying a gun [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=52.96s)]
*  believed to be the one used to shoot Thompson. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=55.68s)]
*  Local officials hailing the employee [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=58.92s)]
*  who made the call to authorities as a hero. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=60.6s)]
*  Listen. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  In some dark corners, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=64.52s)]
*  this killer is being hailed as a hero. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=66.48s)]
*  Hear me on this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=70.28s)]
*  He is no hero. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  The real hero in this story [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  is the person who called 911 at McDonald's this morning. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=76.72s)]
*  Mangione also had clothing and a mask [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=81.6s)]
*  similar to those worn by the shooter [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=83.88s)]
*  when police arrested him Monday, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=85.48s)]
*  as well as writings suggesting ill will [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=87.32s)]
*  toward corporate America. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=89.55999999999999s)]
*  New York City Mayor Eric Adams [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=91.38s)]
*  speaking to the arresting officer yesterday. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=92.88s)]
*  Hey Tyler. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  I guess we found your guy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  Yes, yes, we as New Yorkers, we appreciate it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=99.24s)]
*  And you just did a great job, heads up policing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=102.63999999999999s)]
*  You took a dangerous person off the street. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=105.44s)]
*  We thank you so much. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=107.0s)]
*  It was great to do. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=108.28s)]
*  We're happy to do it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=109.56s)]
*  I can't say I was expecting it, wake it up this morning. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, a former roommate of Mangione [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=113.56s)]
*  says he can't believe Luigi is the man suspected [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=115.52s)]
*  of pulling off this heinous crime. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=118.2s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  Unfathomable. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=121.92s)]
*  Knowing the kind person that I saw and knew. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=123.16s)]
*  I remember he said he had a back issue [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  and he was hoping to get stronger in Hawaii. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=127.36s)]
*  It also weighed on him that he knew [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=129.76s)]
*  that there was an impending surgery. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=131.32s)]
*  Several questions still remain [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=134.4s)]
*  surrounding the shooter's motive [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=136.0s)]
*  as police in both states continue to investigate the case. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=137.2s)]
*  Ainsley, over to you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=140.56s)]
*  So strange book. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=141.48s)]
*  On his ex account, there's a picture of an X-ray. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=142.4s)]
*  We don't know if that's his surgery, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=145.36s)]
*  but it has some hardware in this person's back. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=147.12s)]
*  So apparently in chronic back pain constantly, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=149.68s)]
*  according to residents that he lived with in Hawaii. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=152.52s)]
*  But we'll get to that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much for a great job. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  All right, who is this guy? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  He's from a prominent Italian American family in Maryland. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=159.36s)]
*  His grandparents started a few country clubs. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=162.84s)]
*  They also own some healthcare facilities [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=166.08s)]
*  and real estate companies. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=168.44000000000003s)]
*  And according to friends in Hawaii, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=170.0s)]
*  he wanted to distance himself from this wealthy life. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=171.52s)]
*  His family on social media said that they were shocked. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=175.32000000000002s)]
*  They were devastated. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  Now then his school, he went to the Gilman School, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=179.56s)]
*  which is in Baltimore. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  Now that is a very prominent school. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  It's all boys. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=185.26000000000002s)]
*  He was there from sixth grade until graduation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  He graduated in 2016. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=188.8s)]
*  It costs about $40,000 a year to send your children there. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  And many senators, many governors graduated [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  from the Gilman School. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=197.0s)]
*  His friends called him likable, athletic, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=198.68s)]
*  studious on the quiet side, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=201.12s)]
*  had an interest in technology and robotics. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=203.84s)]
*  And he was the valedictorian of his high school. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  And we're gonna show you a clip of that valedictorian speech [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  in just a second. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=211.68s)]
*  He thanked his parents and he thanked his faculty. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=212.5s)]
*  Then he goes on to have an Ivy League education. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=214.96s)]
*  Goes to UPenn with a bachelor's and a master's degree, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=217.44s)]
*  graduated four years ago in 2020 [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=221.02s)]
*  with a computer science degree and he minored in mathematics. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=223.68s)]
*  He was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=226.6s)]
*  Then he goes to Hawaii. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=230.12s)]
*  He was, that was his last place of residence [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  and people that he lived with in the surf break [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=234.16s)]
*  co-living community said he was in chronic back pain [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=236.04s)]
*  constantly. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=239.76s)]
*  He's been estranged from some of those friends. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  Apparently he left like two years ago. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  That was the last time he had that address. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=245.16s)]
*  But then he went back. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=246.76s)]
*  I'm reading in some of the reports, started a book club. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=248.0s)]
*  Many people left that book club [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=250.68s)]
*  because they didn't agree with some of the book choices. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=252.0s)]
*  The NYPD is saying his writings expressed anger [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  at corporate America. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=258.03999999999996s)]
*  There's a three page manifesto where he was complaining [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=259.4s)]
*  about the healthcare industry. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=262.48s)]
*  He said these parasites had it coming. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  I do apologize for any strife and trauma, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  but it had to be done. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=269.88s)]
*  So he's an anti-capitalist. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=271.88s)]
*  He had some leanings on his Facebook page that, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=273.92s)]
*  or some of his social media that leads us to believe that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  Right, and of course you mentioned he was valedictorian. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=278.76s)]
*  Here's a little of his speech from high school. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=281.76s)]
*  The people in our lives, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=285.76s)]
*  especially our parents and teachers, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=287.68s)]
*  had such huge roles as well. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=290.03999999999996s)]
*  I'd like to personally thank each of you [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=291.92s)]
*  for sending your sons here, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=293.92s)]
*  as I can't imagine the class of 2016 [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=295.56s)]
*  without any one of these men on stage. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=297.8s)]
*  Further, thank you for all the time and love [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=300.84s)]
*  you've put into our lives. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=302.88s)]
*  You've instilled values in us, fed and clothed us, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=304.56s)]
*  and simply been there for us every step of the way. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=308.28s)]
*  It's so surprising to people who knew him, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=311.52s)]
*  that he's the guy, because it's like, are you kidding? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=315.56s)]
*  He was a very popular guy. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=317.96s)]
*  He had it all going for him. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=319.47999999999996s)]
*  There you can see after he was arrested. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=321.12s)]
*  It's one of those things where his image, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=325.88s)]
*  the image of that person, the suspect, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=328.52s)]
*  in that mask flashed around the world. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=331.68s)]
*  And then when he pulled down the mask for the, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=333.64s)]
*  you saw that just a couple of days ago. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=337.32s)]
*  And then when he pulled down the mask [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=339.32s)]
*  at that hostel in New York right there [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=341.48s)]
*  to flirt with the clerk reportedly, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=345.0s)]
*  people got a good look at it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  So it sounds like he made one fatal mistake yesterday, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=348.92s)]
*  and that was he was at this McDonald's, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=352.88s)]
*  not far from the Greyhound bus station in Altoona. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=357.08000000000004s)]
*  And he was over on the side, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=360.68s)]
*  as far away from the counter as possible, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=363.0s)]
*  and he pulled down his mask. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  He was wearing the surgical mask there. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=366.36s)]
*  Pulled down his mask to eat, you gotta do that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=368.48s)]
*  And somebody, it sounds like a customer, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=370.8s)]
*  saw that person and then discreetly went over, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=372.8s)]
*  talked to somebody who was working at that McDonald's, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=375.76s)]
*  and said, I think that's the guy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=378.54s)]
*  They called the cops, the rest is history. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=380.12s)]
*  So I talked to someone high up in the NYPD police department. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=383.24s)]
*  They essentially said, look, before they captured him, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  they had everything but his identity, fingerprints, DNA. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=389.44s)]
*  They had things that show that he was an activist [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=392.96000000000004s)]
*  in that sense, and they were getting closer and closer. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=396.48s)]
*  And it was just old-fashioned style police work, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=399.36s)]
*  put out an image, get it to the public, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=402.24s)]
*  and see if they can track this person down. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=405.44s)]
*  And they did that, so it just goes to show, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=407.44s)]
*  if you see something, you say something. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=411.0s)]
*  But the question is, Brian, that the family members, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=413.2s)]
*  friends, people that were close to him, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=416.04s)]
*  not recognize the photo that was put out there [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=417.56s)]
*  for all of us to see? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=420.48s)]
*  Yeah, that family's gonna make a statement shortly. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=421.8s)]
*  They're very, everybody knows them. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=423.88s)]
*  Evidently, they've got a huge charity. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=426.42s)]
*  They have a huge, looks like a huge club there [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=428.84s)]
*  that they converted in the 1980s. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=433.4s)]
*  So they're of wealth. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=435.2s)]
*  He's got a BA, he's got a master's. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=436.64s)]
*  He seems to have everything, but something went wrong [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=438.96s)]
*  when he left Hawaii, it seems, and he came back. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=441.52s)]
*  He didn't even go to the same place, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=444.96s)]
*  didn't keep in touch with the same friends. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=446.23999999999995s)]
*  And I see this one posting on social media [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=447.96s)]
*  where he has a lot of nutritional things on there. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=450.35999999999996s)]
*  He says, one of his friends, he's supposed to be, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=452.84s)]
*  I guess, at the wedding, hey, I need you to call me. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=454.96s)]
*  I don't know if you're okay. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=457.12s)]
*  Or just in an isolated place. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=459.32s)]
*  But I haven't heard from you in months. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=461.40000000000003s)]
*  You made commitments to me for my wedding, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=463.64000000000004s)]
*  and if you can't honor them, I need to know [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=466.16s)]
*  so I can plan accordingly. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=468.54s)]
*  Just another note, Eric Adams brought up something [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=470.52000000000004s)]
*  that is way overdue. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=473.12s)]
*  You have to have a mask law. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=474.92s)]
*  There's no reason for this guy to be wearing a mask. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=477.04s)]
*  So you have to, if you go indoors, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=479.66s)]
*  you gotta take that mask off. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=481.06s)]
*  If you go into a camp, you gotta take the mask off. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=482.38s)]
*  He's gonna push Ockel to make a statewide rule about masks [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=484.20000000000005s)]
*  because people are using that to their advantage [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=488.08s)]
*  to commit crimes. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=490.8s)]
*  Mostly the criminals. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=491.71999999999997s)]
*  NYPD said that he gave the Unibomber's manifesto [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=493.12s)]
*  a rave review. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  He wrote 13 reviews on books on Google Reads, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=498.88s)]
*  and he follows on X, Edward Snowden, Joe Rogan, AOC. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  They say his writings expressed anger at corporate America. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=505.91999999999996s)]
*  Hats off to the person who recognized him, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=509.4s)]
*  because I have to be honest, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=511.44s)]
*  the pictures of UC right now, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=513.14s)]
*  I don't think that looks like the guy that had the hood, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=515.62s)]
*  that had the mask. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=518.76s)]
*  I wouldn't have recognized him. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=519.5999999999999s)]
*  When I was talking to the cops yesterday, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=520.8s)]
*  they said the eyebrows, the bushy eyebrows, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=522.52s)]
*  is what got them to figure out who it was. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=525.56s)]
*  We'll say this, he did have another manifesto [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=529.0s)]
*  that was set to be released on YouTube [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=532.0s)]
*  that has since been brought down. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=534.52s)]
*  He had it, sometimes you can go in the background [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=536.56s)]
*  of YouTube and schedule a post to be blasted out there. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=539.16s)]
*  YouTube is not gonna let folks be able to see it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=544.28s)]
*  It was supposed to be blasted out at 6.45 last night. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=546.04s)]
*  Not the handwritten one they found on. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=547.4s)]
*  So that was three pages. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=549.24s)]
*  We've got some new additional details. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=550.68s)]
*  Apparently, when he was apprehended at the McDonald's, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=552.68s)]
*  he was found with $8,000 in cash, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=556.16s)]
*  $2,000 in foreign currency, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=559.36s)]
*  and the suspect said about that, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=561.52s)]
*  I don't know where that money came from. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=562.92s)]
*  It must have been planted. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=564.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't have that kind of cash. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=566.28s)]
*  And so you mentioned a moment ago [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=568.24s)]
*  that his ex-account features an X-ray [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=569.48s)]
*  of somebody who's had backfusion surgery, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=573.28s)]
*  and you mentioned how when he lived in Hawaii, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=576.4s)]
*  one of the managers there said that chronic back pain [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=579.4s)]
*  impacted everything in his life. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  He says, including his ability to have a romantic life [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  or enjoy surfing. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=590.24s)]
*  And what's interesting is when you think about, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=592.28s)]
*  and you know, the manifesto talks about greed [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=594.52s)]
*  and in the healthcare industry, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=597.88s)]
*  that guy's 26 years old. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=600.4s)]
*  What happens when you are 26 years old? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=602.92s)]
*  You are knocked off of your parents' health insurance [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=607.52s)]
*  in many cases. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=610.52s)]
*  We don't know if he was on his parents' health insurance, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=611.36s)]
*  but that is, you know, you can have your kids on it until 26. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=614.76s)]
*  If he's been impacted by that, was that part of it? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=618.0799999999999s)]
*  And when you, apparently, according to the cops [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=621.5999999999999s)]
*  here in New York, when you read his three page note [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=624.52s)]
*  that he was found with, and it was handwritten [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=627.4399999999999s)]
*  because he didn't want a digital trail, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=629.36s)]
*  it echoes what was found on those three gun casings, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=631.76s)]
*  you know, about deny and all that other stuff. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=635.6s)]
*  And it looks literally like he was caught red handed. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=638.68s)]
*  He had the gun, he had the note, he had the fake ID, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vd7ntd16o&t=643.12s)]
