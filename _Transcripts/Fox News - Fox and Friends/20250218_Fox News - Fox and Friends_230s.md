# James Carville's surprising advice to Dems: 'Get out of the way'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ)
*  He also said there are millions in the Social Security database that are listed between [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the ages of 100 and 159. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=5.74s)]
*  I mean, this is crazy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=7.34s)]
*  Yeah, and I... [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=8.34s)]
*  If you don't live to be 159, why are they in the database? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=9.34s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=11.4s)]
*  I was reading about that this morning, and apparently if there is some data missing from [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=12.4s)]
*  your exact birthday, they default it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  And they put it as, the reference point is May 20th, 1875, which was part of an international [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=19.52s)]
*  standard setting conference held in Paris known as the Convention du Meter. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=28.02s)]
*  And so that's why so many people are showing up as their data being 150 years old. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=33.6s)]
*  They didn't have the exact date, so they went to the default. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=38.5s)]
*  And that just goes to show you how screwed up the federal government is. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=41.34s)]
*  That goes to show you why Doge is trying to fix it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=44.3s)]
*  It's so screwed up that the Democrats don't have a response to this. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=46.7s)]
*  And so James Carville tries to give them a little bit of wisdom. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=49.66s)]
*  This is what he's saying that they need to do, watch. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=53.14s)]
*  Everybody was like down B, depressed, and this happened quickly. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=56.86s)]
*  And I think, I'm almost positive, it's going to continue to happen. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=60.82s)]
*  So the question is, how should Democratic politicians respond to this? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=65.06s)]
*  And what I think they should do is what we call in rural America, play possum. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=70.56s)]
*  Just let it go. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=76.3s)]
*  Don't get in the way of it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=77.84s)]
*  Or as we like to say, don't just stand there, do nothing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=79.34s)]
*  Let this germinate. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  We don't need to be, we don't need to get in front of it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=85.77999999999999s)]
*  This freight train is moving. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=88.82s)]
*  Let's just get out of the way. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=91.33999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=94.05999999999999s)]
*  It's absolutely right. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=94.61999999999999s)]
*  Totally right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=95.22s)]
*  It's the Seinfeld way. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=95.74s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=97.86s)]
*  So you just watch and then pick your spots. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=98.46s)]
*  I think people like putting him on, like seeing Charles Barkley and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=101.74s)]
*  they like seeing John McEnroe because he said sensational things. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=105.78s)]
*  By the way, John Fetterman called. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=108.69999999999999s)]
*  They said to dress up a little bit. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=109.82s)]
*  I mean, he could not look worse on camera. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=111.41999999999999s)]
*  I mean, what is he doing? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=113.02s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=114.46s)]
*  He's saying don't do anything. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=115.82s)]
*  He's also the guy that said he guarantees you Kamala Harris would win. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=117.53999999999999s)]
*  Well, so this guy really hasn't been successful since Pilgrim. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=120.98s)]
*  No, I will say this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=123.18s)]
*  James Carville is still a partisan. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=124.46s)]
*  He's still got a root for his team. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=126.58s)]
*  But I do think he gives them solid advice sometimes telling them where to adjust. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=128.62s)]
*  And I think at this point, he's right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=133.34s)]
*  It's like you see all this singing, all these protesting. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=135.02s)]
*  You're going against the American people right now. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=138.74s)]
*  They're on Donald Trump's side. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=140.78s)]
*  His approval rating is going up. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=142.3s)]
*  All they're doing is attacking Elon Musk, who used to be on his team. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=143.82s)]
*  You guys are all driving his cars now. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=147.45999999999998s)]
*  Now you hate him. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=149.54s)]
*  Just play dead. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  Just lay down. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=151.9s)]
*  Just take it for a little bit. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=152.9s)]
*  And if the Trump administration messes up, then do some protesting. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=154.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=158.18s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=158.82s)]
*  He is a realist. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=159.66s)]
*  And the Republicans control all the government. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=160.85999999999999s)]
*  They've got the House, the Senate, and the White House. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=163.9s)]
*  So there's nothing the Democrats can do other than sing about it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=166.01999999999998s)]
*  So essentially what he's saying, he's saying give them enough rope. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=169.42s)]
*  Eventually they'll give us something to run on. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=173.14s)]
*  But right now, get out of the way because his popularity, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=175.66s)]
*  according to the polls, is surging. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=178.82s)]
*  Jen Psaki over the weekend was warning Democrats, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=180.54s)]
*  stop screaming this constitutional crisis mess. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=183.05999999999997s)]
*  That didn't work. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=186.17999999999998s)]
*  They did it for three weeks. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=186.94s)]
*  I think I have the best suggestion. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=188.1s)]
*  Pick your spots. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=189.61999999999998s)]
*  Pick spots that matter. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=192.26s)]
*  I got a problem with this. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=193.61999999999998s)]
*  But I don't have a problem with that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=194.77999999999997s)]
*  Fetterman said the other day, he's got like two or three things [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=195.7s)]
*  that he really likes and one he doesn't. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=198.29999999999998s)]
*  And I listen to that because I know that he's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=200.06s)]
*  trying to pick his spots. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=202.62s)]
*  When everything is terrible, your house is on fire, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=204.82s)]
*  then no one's listening. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=207.5s)]
*  Well, the problem for the Democrats right now [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=208.5s)]
*  is 70% of swing voters like what Trump is doing with Doge. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=210.9s)]
*  And everything the Democrats are currently protesting [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=215.7s)]
*  is Doge-related. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=218.82s)]
*  I'm going to go ahead and get started. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=230.06s)]
*  I'm going to go ahead and get started. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2AmHdJ6IQ&t=232.02s)]
