# ‘NO END IN SIGHT’: NYC doubling down on housing migrants
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4)
*  New York City planning to continue using pricey Manhattan hotel rooms to house some of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=0.0s)]
*  city's 200,000 plus migrants. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=4.4s)]
*  A new contract would make 14,000 rooms available, costing taxpayers over $300 each per day. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=7.0s)]
*  That's on top of the $2.3 billion spent on housing migrants just since 2022. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=13.3s)]
*  Vicki Palladino is a New York City councilwoman who opposes the plan. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=19.12s)]
*  She joins us now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=22.48s)]
*  Vicki, why is New York City doubling down on taking resources from its own residents [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=23.48s)]
*  and giving them to illegal migrants? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  You know, we've been talking about this now for two years. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=31.0s)]
*  And it's almost like we're pressing the reset button. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=33.92s)]
*  Once again, we're now, we need more. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  We got 150 right now New York City hotels being taken over by migrants. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  The cost is $2.3 billion. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=46.68s)]
*  No, it's closer to $5 billion. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=50.0s)]
*  So, you know, don't forget the debit card that goes with that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=52.68s)]
*  It's a free pass. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=56.04s)]
*  14,000 more rooms. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  Now, also, let's think about this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=59.68s)]
*  There's been a little lull here in bringing up the migrants and the what's going on here [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=62.96s)]
*  with the illegals and what it's costing the city. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=67.76s)]
*  We've kind of taken a bit of a hiatus because other things have been deflecting from the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  point that this problem still very much exists. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  And it's only going to grow. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=78.2s)]
*  There's no end in sight. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  14,000 more hotel rooms. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=80.92s)]
*  That means they're going to branch out now more so into the outer boroughs, quite possibly [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=82.92s)]
*  to more independent hotel owners, making them millionaires. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=88.4s)]
*  And we're struggling making them millionaires overnight. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, people are getting rich off of that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=95.12s)]
*  Millionaires. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=97.16s)]
*  It's huge. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=98.16s)]
*  So why are you, one of only a few people in New York City government, speaking out about [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=99.16s)]
*  this? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=103.08s)]
*  Aren't citizens going to their council people and saying, stop this, I'm tired of paying [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=104.08s)]
*  for something that doesn't help me. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=108.08s)]
*  It, in fact, hurts me. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=109.6s)]
*  It's a very good question. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=110.6s)]
*  We have 51 council members. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=112.16s)]
*  We have nine that sit on what we call the Common Sense Caucus. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  There are three Democrats that make up the Common Sense Caucus. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=117.88s)]
*  The other six are Republicans. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  We have six Republicans in a radical, progressive city council. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  To my city council, if you were to ask any of the council members whose offices are remote, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  people go to their offices because they come to mine because they're not getting what they [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=135.28s)]
*  need service-wise from their city council members. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=139.48s)]
*  Their offices are closed. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=142.2s)]
*  So when you talk to my city council, my city council doesn't even think this is enough. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=144.04s)]
*  This isn't enough. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=149.6s)]
*  The fact that it's killing tourism, killing our economy, we're looking at a $10 billion [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=150.6s)]
*  bill and Hocal's going to come down here and dictate to us what we should do? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=155.76s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=161.0s)]
*  Here's what the New York City Department of Social Services says in a statement to us, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  quote, while this is a new competitive solicitation, it will simply replace an existing emergency [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=165.8s)]
*  contract and not add 14,000 additional units on top of the existing capacity while allowing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=170.96s)]
*  DHS to continue to provide safe housing for newly arrived families and individuals as [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=177.24s)]
*  they work toward independence and the next step of their journey. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=182.56s)]
*  I want to focus on that last part. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  Are those individuals who can't speak the language have no roots here? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=187.88000000000002s)]
*  Are they independent now, taxpaying citizens, providing into the system as opposed to taking? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=191.8s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=198.36s)]
*  That's the biggest fallacy we've got going. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=199.36s)]
*  Okay, now let's take 100% of them and let's knock off maybe 20% that are actually looking [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=201.24s)]
*  for jobs to be able to work. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=208.72000000000003s)]
*  But now what we have, they're driving around on these motor scooters and these motorized [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=211.16000000000003s)]
*  things and they're doing delivery services in that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=216.72000000000003s)]
*  That's not the road. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=219.8s)]
*  That's not the road to getting better or to making them advance in our society. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=221.24s)]
*  We got kids who go to school who cannot sit in the classroom. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=226.08s)]
*  I speak to my principals all the time. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  These kids are shifting and moving around because they've never had any kind of schooling. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=231.56s)]
*  The language gap, we have one terrific school in my district that's failing now because [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=236.36s)]
*  they've got such a language barrier. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=241.96s)]
*  They need Spanish in this particular school in order for the kids to pick it up. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  Like I said, I don't see an end to this and nothing's put in place. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=251.24s)]
*  They're flooding in with no programs. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=257.12s)]
*  And what you just mentioned, how is that beneficial to any of the children, the citizen children [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=260.08s)]
*  and the migrant children? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=264.36s)]
*  They're all losing and that's horrible, especially when it comes to our kids. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=265.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=268.48s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=269.48s)]
*  Thanks for shedding light on this and keeping up your fight. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=270.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSe1JT6sKd4&t=274.28000000000003s)]
