# Trump says he's in 'active talks' with China on tariffs
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8)
*  All right, here we go. President Trump giving an update on his tariff war with China. According [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=0.0s)]
*  to a new interview, he says this. Trump says China's President Xi has called him and that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=4.84s)]
*  his administration is in active talks with the Chinese to strike a deal. I don't think [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=10.64s)]
*  that's a sign of weakness on his behalf. Trump says of Xi, adding that he expects to have [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=14.68s)]
*  a full slate of deals announced over the next three, three to four weeks. He also says he's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=19.56s)]
*  made about 200 deals on tariffs. He told that to Time magazine over the weekend. Treasury [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=24.64s)]
*  Secretary Scott Besson is in the eye of the storm, literally. And it's great to see you, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=30.28s)]
*  Mr. Secretary. Good to see you, Brian. Probably you get the best reviews of anyone in the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  administration outside the president. Your thoughts about the U.S.-China standoff right [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=38.28s)]
*  now? Well, Brian, first of all, it's all the president, especially on the 18 important [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=44.32s)]
*  trading partners were doing bespoke deals and he's going to be intimately involved in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=48.84s)]
*  every one. Two weeks ago, when we had the Japanese delegation come in, he started it [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=54.96s)]
*  in the oval and then we took them into the negotiating room. So he laid the groundwork, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=60.0s)]
*  told them personally how important the relationship was, but also how important a fair deal for [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  the American people is. So what is it? What does these deals look like? Are they going [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=71.84s)]
*  to be a thousand pages? Are they going to be 12 pages? Or is this going to be an alteration [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=76.28s)]
*  to the current relationship, let's say from Vietnam to Japan? Again, Brian, it'll depend [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  from country to country. I think the important thing is the agreement in principle that USTR, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=87.76s)]
*  this is what they do. They paper these very large trade deals and Jameson Greer has a [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=94.84s)]
*  fantastic team and they will do the final documents. The important thing is that we [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=101.08s)]
*  reach an agreement in principle to end these unfair trading practices that have been going [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  on for decades. So this is what I understand in the Wall Street Journal today. They say [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=112.48s)]
*  your goal is six nations a week up until the date of July 8th, the deadline. And then whatever [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=117.0s)]
*  is left, it'll be reciprocal down the line. What do you think? We'll see where it goes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=123.68s)]
*  We'll see who's coming in good faith and who's not. But again, as I said, there are [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=128.72s)]
*  15 to 18 important trading relationships. We'll put China to the side and then we're [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=134.04s)]
*  moving very quickly with many of those other countries. A lot of our Asian trading partners [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=140.68s)]
*  have really come with their A game and are trying to solve this fairness problem. What [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=146.12s)]
*  about China? Do you plan on calling your counterpart? We will see what happens with China. China [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=151.68s)]
*  that it's important. I think it's unsustainable from the Chinese side. So maybe they'll call [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=159.56s)]
*  me one day. The WTO says trade could dip 80% between the US and China if something doesn't [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=167.8s)]
*  happen quickly. Do you see it that way? Well, look, that's why I believe it's unsustainable [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=175.44s)]
*  because they sell to us five times more than we sell to them. And we are a crucial part [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=181.14s)]
*  of their business model. So selling cheap, subsidized goods into the US is crucial for [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=187.54s)]
*  the Chinese economy. I believe we're already seeing a slowdown there. The government's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=194.29999999999998s)]
*  trying to take measures countercyclical to help the economy. So Brian, in the history [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=198.68s)]
*  of trade negotiations or trade slowdowns, it is the surplus country that always loses [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=205.26s)]
*  the most. And we have a huge deficit. Currently right now, are you worried about empty shelves? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=212.26s)]
*  Because they say that a lot of these supply lines and the cargo ships are being held up. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=220.6s)]
*  A lot of people are saying turn it around with the tariffs this high. I don't want the product. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=224.84s)]
*  Are you worried about empty shelves? Not at present. We have some great retailers. I assume [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=228.64s)]
*  they pre-ordered. I think we'll see some elasticities. I think we'll see replacements. And then we [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=234.72s)]
*  will see how quickly the Chinese want to de-escalate. Tomorrow's your day. It's economics [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=240.6s)]
*  day 100 days in. What's your message? Look, we've got a three-legged stool here. It's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=246.66s)]
*  trade, it's tax, it's deregulation. President Trump has come out of the box roaring. And [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=253.66s)]
*  I think this is something new for the American people. He's given one, two press conferences [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=259.26s)]
*  a day, an incredible level of transparency. Contrast that with the previous administration [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=263.78s)]
*  where the president, we're not quite sure who was running policy, likely not President [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=270.97999999999996s)]
*  Biden. And we are moving forward for the American people. And it's very, very exciting. We're [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=277.29999999999995s)]
*  going to continue to make the U.S. the best destination for capital in the world. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=285.02s)]
*  And you have one of the most challenging jobs, but you seem to absolutely love it. Mr. Secretary, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=288.53999999999996s)]
*  congratulations on it. 100 days down, three and a half years to go. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=292.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyq81euSj8&t=296.3s)]
