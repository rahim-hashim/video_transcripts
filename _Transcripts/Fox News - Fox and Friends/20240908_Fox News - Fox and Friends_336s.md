# Is Kamala admitting that Biden’s policies didn’t work?
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8)
*  It's Fox News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=0.0s)]
*  When's the last time she missed a Sunday with us? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=2.2s)]
*  It's been a long time. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=5.5s)]
*  Listen, you're stuck with me people. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=6.7s)]
*  We love it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=8.6s)]
*  We get to the holidays. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  I see what you're doing there. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=10.0s)]
*  I like it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=11.4s)]
*  There's a lot of news going on. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=12.9s)]
*  It's hard for us to sneak away. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=14.44s)]
*  It's true. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=16.16s)]
*  It's true. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=16.8s)]
*  What is your biggest, you're in the middle of this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=17.48s)]
*  We're 48 hours away from a big political moment. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=20.12s)]
*  What's your top line thought? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=22.72s)]
*  Well listen, with those poll numbers you talked about, gosh, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=24.64s)]
*  there's so much at stake in this debate. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=27.04s)]
*  And what if this is the only time these two actually go [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  head to head? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Fascinating to me that they've never met. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=32.2s)]
*  I mean, imagine meeting someone for the first time [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  on the stage when you're like, and now I'm [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=36.4s)]
*  going to try to rip your head off because I [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=37.64s)]
*  should be the next president. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=39.16s)]
*  I mean, there's so much at stake here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=40.08s)]
*  Which version of these two shows up on the stage? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=42.2s)]
*  Is it more about style or substance? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=45.08s)]
*  I think that these polls show that everything [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  is within the margin of error. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=49.16s)]
*  And that means that there is a ton of pressure on both [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  these candidates for Tuesday night. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  What do you think about Kamala Harris? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=55.84s)]
*  There's this topic that people are talking about. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=57.48s)]
*  The New York Times is warning her. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=59.36s)]
*  She takes the stage. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  It's not just against Donald Trump. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=61.8s)]
*  It's also against the legacy of Joe Biden. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=63.8s)]
*  Carlos Lozada writing in the New York Times, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=66.28s)]
*  Harris will have to face off against President Biden, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=69.2s)]
*  his record, the shifting public approval rating, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=71.36s)]
*  and their intertwined legacies from now until election day. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  Her supporters are eager to watch her prosecute [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=76.08s)]
*  the case against Trump. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=78.64s)]
*  But when it comes to the Biden years, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=80.44s)]
*  Harris is both prosecutor and defendant, reformer [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=82.4s)]
*  and institutionalist, contrast and continuity. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=85.56s)]
*  And that's a harder sell. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  And Shannon, Biden's on the campaign trail for her. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=90.4s)]
*  I mean, he is in the rust belt. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=94.44s)]
*  He's in the Midwest. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=97.16s)]
*  It's really tricky because we all know [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=98.88s)]
*  the polling that's gone on consistently for the past year [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=100.68s)]
*  has been that people don't feel good about the economy [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=103.28s)]
*  and they blame this administration for where they're at. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=105.4s)]
*  So how does she, as she tried to do in the CNN interview, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=107.84s)]
*  she did talk about like, look at all the good things [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=110.44s)]
*  we've done, how do you take ownership of that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=112.28s)]
*  and then say, but I've got a different way forward, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  which is kind of the theme, the future, turning the page, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=117.0s)]
*  I've got the new way forward. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=120.2s)]
*  Is that an acknowledgement that some of the things [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=121.16s)]
*  from this administration have not worked? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=123.12s)]
*  It's a really difficult needle to thread [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=125.36s)]
*  because she is still the vice president to this president. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=127.04s)]
*  They're still the current administration. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=130.16s)]
*  So it'll be interesting to see how much she does try [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=131.6s)]
*  to distance herself from President Biden [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=134.04s)]
*  and his unpopular policies on Tuesday night [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  while also saying they've gotten good things done [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=138.6s)]
*  for the American people. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=140.32s)]
*  Shannon, this election is so interesting [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=141.6s)]
*  and it's not just because the polls are tight [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=144.24s)]
*  and it's not just because Donald Trump's running again [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  or the intrigue that happened, although it is important, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=148.72s)]
*  how she was installed versus voted into this position [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=152.28s)]
*  through a primary, but it's really the issues. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=156.88s)]
*  I mean, we know it's gonna be inflation [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=159.08s)]
*  and border and crime, but Donald Trump has introduced [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=160.8s)]
*  these new issues into this debate, I think. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=164.44s)]
*  One of them is Make America Healthy Again, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=169.4s)]
*  taking on corporate greed and collusion with our food [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=171.24s)]
*  and pharma and all the things that are making us unhealthy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  And then the other are issues of War and Peace. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  You just saw Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney to, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=181.4s)]
*  I would argue, pro-war, war-mongering kind of people, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  into the discussion, endorsing her, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  and he is on stage yesterday in Wisconsin saying, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=192.8s)]
*  I am a president for peace. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=195.8s)]
*  I'm gonna end these wars. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  There were no wars under my administration. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=199.32s)]
*  I didn't start any wars under my administration. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=201.96s)]
*  So those are issues that I think are really bipartisan. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=204.88s)]
*  How do you think they will play out in the debate, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=208.04s)]
*  and do you think that they could actually [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=210.12s)]
*  move independent voters and maybe Democrats [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=212.04s)]
*  who are disillusioned with the Democrat Party [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=215.68s)]
*  not doing anything on Make America Healthy Again, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=219.76s)]
*  or maybe even that they're now considered the War Party? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=222.4s)]
*  And I think that's why articulation of policy, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=227.16s)]
*  there's gotta be some substance in this thing [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=229.8s)]
*  on Tuesday night. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=231.56s)]
*  I was actually going to a Nats baseball game here [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=232.4s)]
*  a couple weeks ago when I was riding the Metro, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=234.52s)]
*  it's the easiest way to get there, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=236.52s)]
*  and there was a young guy, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=238.24s)]
*  I would say these guys in their 20s, maybe early 30s, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=239.48s)]
*  were talking about who they were gonna vote for, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=241.6s)]
*  and I'm kind of, you know, we're always listening in [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=243.28s)]
*  on these conversations, and the one guy said, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=244.88s)]
*  I'm voting for her because he's gonna start World War III. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=247.76s)]
*  And you think, okay, well look at where we are [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=250.6s)]
*  with the real hotspots and trouble around the globe. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=252.88s)]
*  So if there's that perception that Donald Trump [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=256.2s)]
*  is the one who's gonna start World War III, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=258.84s)]
*  and you hear him in all his stump speeches, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  the former president saying, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=261.8s)]
*  I'm going to prevent World War III, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  that shows one of those things, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=265.12s)]
*  like there's room for him to actually try to articulate [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=266.36s)]
*  and make the case because clearly among at least this, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=269.12s)]
*  you know, anecdotal incident I had with these young guys, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=272.12s)]
*  they think he's actually the more volatile, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=275.76s)]
*  and I think, you know, that's probably true [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=277.96s)]
*  of his personality, but for them that interpreted [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=279.2s)]
*  into the fact that they think he's gonna be the one [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jR59kY0L8&t=281.59999999999997s)]
