# Doocy: Bernie Sanders is saying the quiet part out loud
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY)
*  All right, let's talk debate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=0.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris's multiple flip flops, which are famous on liberal issues like fracking [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=2.0s)]
*  and Medicare for all, are sure to be brought up by former President Donald Trump in tomorrow [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=6.28s)]
*  night's debate. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  But according to Senator Bernie Sanders, Harris is by no means ditching her values. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=18.6s)]
*  I don't think she's abandoning her ideals. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=19.6s)]
*  I think she's trying to be pragmatic and doing what she thinks is right in order to win the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=22.96s)]
*  election. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=28.52s)]
*  Her views are not mine, but I do consider her progressive. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=29.52s)]
*  Consider her progressive. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=34.04s)]
*  Joining us right now to react and to give us an update on Trump's debate prep is Trump [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=35.04s)]
*  2024 National Press Secretary Caroline Levitt joins us from South Florida. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=38.8s)]
*  Caroline, good morning to you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=42.92s)]
*  Good morning, Steve. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=45.16s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=46.16s)]
*  It's great to have you as well. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=47.16s)]
*  So Bernie's saying the quiet part out loud. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=48.16s)]
*  She is becoming more moderate, more to the middle to get elected. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  She was way out left, but now she's in the middle. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  Otherwise, she can't win. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=57.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=60.24s)]
*  Senator Sanders is saying what the Harris campaign doesn't want the American people [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=61.24s)]
*  to know, and that is Kamala Harris is a typical career politician who lies to get elected. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=64.08s)]
*  And she is trying to run away from her record over the past four years, but she can't because [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=70.2s)]
*  it is the Harris Biden administration. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=75.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris cast the tie breaking vote to create inflation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=77.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris is the border czar. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=81.2s)]
*  She has allowed an invasion of more than 20 million illegals into this country. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=83.16s)]
*  President Trump will finally hold her accountable for the failures of the past four years and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  also her failures throughout her entire career, dating back to her time as attorney general [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=91.4s)]
*  from California and her time as a district attorney from San Francisco. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=96.12s)]
*  She's made a lot of bad decisions and she can't run from them anymore. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=100.0s)]
*  The New York Times, Caroline, had an item yesterday that described apparently the how [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=104.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is preparing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  It's not traditional debate prep like she's doing at that hotel in Pittsburgh. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=111.02s)]
*  But instead, essentially, he's got a lot of aides and advisors in referring to policies [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=118.5s)]
*  that he passed and stuff like that to refresh him on his record. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=124.94s)]
*  Nobody's playing her. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=128.34s)]
*  Aides sit at long tables. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=130.5s)]
*  It's more of a question and answer period. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=132.22s)]
*  But what I thought was interesting is New York Times says he's actually preparing more [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=135.66s)]
*  for this one than he did in 2016 or 2020. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  Does that sound about right to you? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=143.9s)]
*  President Trump is well prepared for the debate tomorrow night. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=146.82s)]
*  That is right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=149.26s)]
*  He doesn't need traditional debate prep. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=150.26s)]
*  He's proven to be one of the most effective debaters in modern political history. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  Just look at how he knocked off Joe Biden out of the race and the CNN debate stage. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=155.74s)]
*  He is very well read on Kamala Harris's record. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=159.62s)]
*  Again, not just her failures of the past four years, her botched Afghanistan withdrawal, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=162.1s)]
*  her disastrous time as borders are, her radical economic policies that have created suffering [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=166.62s)]
*  across this country. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=172.34s)]
*  But he also is well read on her time as DA, as her time as AG. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris refused to prosecute violent murderers during her time as attorney general. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=177.74s)]
*  As a district attorney, she refused to deport illegal immigrants from the state of California. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=182.54s)]
*  And for every new solution that Kamala Harris will propose on that debate stage tomorrow [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=188.46s)]
*  night, President Trump will ask her the question of why don't you go do it right now? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=192.62s)]
*  Kamala is trying to run as the change candidate, the candidate of the future. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=197.18s)]
*  She is neither of those things. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=200.62s)]
*  She is the incumbent vice president. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=202.44s)]
*  She has been an epic failure. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=204.58s)]
*  She has been a co-partner in Joe Biden's disastrous policies, and she's been running from the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=206.22s)]
*  media now for 50 days, refusing to answer questions. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  Will President Trump will be the first to ask her those tough questions on the debate [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  stage tomorrow night? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  One final question for you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=219.02s)]
*  Another little tidbit from the Times is they said that in private, Mr. Trump is repeatedly [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=220.85999999999999s)]
*  toyed with dropping out of the ABC debate because he feels that they are going to be [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=226.73999999999998s)]
*  unfair to him. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=231.5s)]
*  When you look at the CNN debate, you know, I don't think they... [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  To me, it seemed like they were right down the middle. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=238.5s)]
*  You know, they just turned off everybody's mic, and you got to see Donald Trump, you [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=240.54s)]
*  got to see Joe Biden, and of course Joe Biden had to drop out. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=244.33999999999997s)]
*  Is he worried about ABC not being fair? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=248.14s)]
*  We are worried about ABC not being fair, to be honest with you. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=251.42s)]
*  Lindsey Davis just a few weeks ago compared President Trump's rallies to KKK events. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=254.66s)]
*  So like usual, President Trump knows he's going into a hostile environment, but he's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=260.3s)]
*  fearless. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=264.46s)]
*  He's not afraid to do it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=265.46s)]
*  The CNN debate proved to be very successful for him, and we know that he will be very [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=266.46s)]
*  successful tomorrow night as well. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=270.41999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=272.06s)]
*  I know you've got a very busy week. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09IXbmPSNY&t=273.06s)]
