# 'NO INDICATION' hostage release won't happen today: Lt Col Peter Lerner
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc)
*  Coming in with a Fox News alert, a temporary ceasefire now on its third day as part of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=0.0s)]
*  the deal to free more innocent hostages from Hamas terrorists and get them back to Israel [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  today. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=11.32s)]
*  IDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner joins us live from Israel with an update. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=12.32s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=18.04s)]
*  The first thing I want to ask, we had a source from I believe the Red Cross saying that it [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=20.12s)]
*  didn't look great to get hostages out today. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=24.04s)]
*  Can you give us any update on that? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=26.32s)]
*  Yeah, I actually spoke to the Red Cross earlier today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=29.040000000000003s)]
*  I can say that I think their statement was taken a bit out of context. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  We are planning to continue the pause, the operational pause, in order to bring home [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=37.04s)]
*  the hostages. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  They haven't had any indication that it won't happen today. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=43.24s)]
*  Neither are we. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  That we are focused on holding our fire and maintaining our defensive operational pause [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  on the ground in northern Gaza and facilitating humanitarian aid into Gaza while we're looking [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=53.04s)]
*  forward to the release of some more hostages today. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=59.36s)]
*  I take that to mean that we shouldn't worry yet and I appreciate that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=63.2s)]
*  Moving on from that, looking at the hostages that have been released so far, it kind of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=68.72s)]
*  sticks out in our world that Americans haven't been released, although we value all these [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=73.24s)]
*  lives equally. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=78.2s)]
*  We want them all to come home. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=79.2s)]
*  Are you getting any pressure from the Biden administration to negotiate for Americans [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=80.72s)]
*  specifically? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=84.56s)]
*  So, I'm not aware of that pressure and that would not be within the realm of the IDF. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=85.56s)]
*  Of course, we are working to bring home all of the hostages, every last one of them, and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=92.44s)]
*  they need to come home. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=96.64s)]
*  That is what we are demanding. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=97.64s)]
*  And as we move forward with the operations, we will continue to demand that they come [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=99.52s)]
*  home, that they're brought back to their families, to their loved ones, that have been for the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=105.84s)]
*  last 51 days now, their lives have been torn to pieces with anguish and concern for their [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  family members. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  So, we expect that they all come home. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  We're demanding that every last one of them comes home and that needs to be implemented [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=120.04s)]
*  as soon as possible. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=124.48s)]
*  Regarding to who will be released today, the hostages that will be planned to release today, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=127.48s)]
*  I can't say whom will be released. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=131.4s)]
*  We are taking it day by day. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  And if we learn anything from yesterday, from the reality that Hamas tried to delay, postpone, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=135.8s)]
*  or create additional pressure on Israel and Israeli society, I think we need to be very [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=144.72s)]
*  cautious jumping to conclusions. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  We nevertheless are planning every date at a time and making sure that our process, our [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=153.0s)]
*  support staff, our Air Force, our medical staff are available to assist the hostages [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=160.08s)]
*  that are released, whomever they are. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  I appreciate that you pointed back to the fact you're an IDF spokesperson, Defense Force. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=169.72000000000003s)]
*  And this question much more aligns with that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=173.8s)]
*  Some of us were taken by surprise to see that more than 10 Thai hostages were released. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=176.4s)]
*  is reporting that that was negotiated by Iran, kind of outside of what's happening between [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=185.2s)]
*  Israel, the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  And so my question is, does that undermine tactically, does that undermine the offensive [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=192.92s)]
*  you all have and the ceasefire that is very intricately woven together here? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=197.64s)]
*  Because it's more than just trading. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=202.44s)]
*  This is stopping surveillance, other things. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=204.0s)]
*  This having those types of negotiations go on, does that undermine you tactically at [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=206.28s)]
*  all? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=210.12s)]
*  Joy, we wouldn't be in a state where Hamas was releasing anybody if it wasn't for the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=211.76s)]
*  military might of the IDF and the pressure we induced on Hamas in the last seven weeks. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=216.08s)]
*  They would not have anything to motivate them to hand over anybody, Israelis or Thai or [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=222.0s)]
*  Filipino. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=227.8s)]
*  And of course, these efforts work in sync. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=228.8s)]
*  And we are happy for any civilian that is released from the clutches of this brutal, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=232.56s)]
*  merciless terrorist organization. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=237.28s)]
*  Of course, from our perspective, we're looking forward for the days ahead and we are trying [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=240.24s)]
*  to be prepared and we will be prepared for the next stage of taking the war back to Hamas [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=246.12s)]
*  and making sure that they can't ever rule the Gaza Strip as a terrorist entity, as an [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  organization that has the powers of government and can use that power to build a terrorist [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=256.36s)]
*  army, to launch a merciless attack against our civilians, abduct Israelis and foreign [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=262.36s)]
*  nationals into their terror tunnel system. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=267.12s)]
*  So from our perspective, every life that comes home, every single civilian, every person [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=271.08s)]
*  that comes home is a world into itself and we need to extend that and increase that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=277.68s)]
*  Indeed, our war goals, the two war goals, work hand in hand. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=284.24s)]
*  One of the first is bringing the hostages home and second is removing Hamas from governing [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=293.64s)]
*  So we will continue to be prepared for that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=294.8s)]
*  We will utilize our power and we will be prepared for mobilization if that does not result in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=297.24s)]
*  more hostages being transferred or handed over to Israel. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=304.48s)]
*  It seems to me that you stand ready and willing, like any defense force should. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  You probably have a big fight ahead of you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=313.48s)]
*  So please reiterate to your troops, stay safe and we hope this is over soon. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, take care. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=319.76s)]
*  Thanks, Jerry. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgWdINaBuc&t=321.84000000000003s)]
