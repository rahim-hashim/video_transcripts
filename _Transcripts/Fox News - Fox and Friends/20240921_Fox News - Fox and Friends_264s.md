# We need 'real leadership' in the Secret Service, former agent says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc)
*  Members of the advanced team. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=0.0s)]
*  We're very diligent. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=2.4s)]
*  There was complacency on the part of others that led to a breach of security [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=4.66s)]
*  protocols while July 13th is a failure. We're not proud of it, but we [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=9.8s)]
*  certainly have been rising to this moment. That was acting Secret Service [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  Director Ronald Rowe owning up to the failures in security that led to the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=19.16s)]
*  first assassination attempt on former President Trump back in July. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=23.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, the House passes a bill for equal Secret Service protection for all [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=27.36s)]
*  presidential candidates. Here to react is former Secret Service agent Tim [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=30.96s)]
*  Miller. Tim, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=35.12s)]
*  How significant it seems somewhat obvious, but I guess how significant is [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=38.32s)]
*  it that the acting director takes responsibility and specifically talked [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=43.36s)]
*  about complacency and in the advanced scouting in preparation for a Trump [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  rally? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm glad we got to this point. We've been waiting for the Secret [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=54.800000000000004s)]
*  Service. We all watched what happened. And let me say this. The sad part to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=59.64s)]
*  this whole thing is the heroism of the rank and file agents virtually every [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  day is being overshadowed by the leadership right now. And to your [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=68.36s)]
*  point, well, you know, this is a fundamental cultural shift in the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=73.76s)]
*  Secret Service. They need to get back to the mission of doing what they do or [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=79.2s)]
*  used to do very well. And that's the advance work. Remember, that's the most [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=84.36s)]
*  important part of a protective operation is the advance work, making [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=90.12s)]
*  sure that the protect these coming into a safe and secure location. And I [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=94.32s)]
*  would argue that it wasn't just complacency. It was competency to who [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=99.72s)]
*  are we hiring? We ought to have the brightest and the best and the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=104.92s)]
*  sharpest. And we used to do that. I think it's time to refocus on the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=107.84s)]
*  mission. Just I don't want to put words into your mouth, but I'm trying to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  connect the dots on a couple of things you said there. You said it represents [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=115.16s)]
*  a cultural shift or we need a cultural shift. And I guess as an illustration of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  that, are you giving me the way that the Secret Service has been hiring? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=122.98s)]
*  What's the shift? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the shift is the way the Secret Service is hiring. Let me tell you, when [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  I got hired, I'd been a Marine Corps officer, had two commands, had been a [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=131.46s)]
*  police officer, and everybody that was being hired had a demonstrated track [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=135.0s)]
*  record of being, you know, competent under pressure. And this is a job, as [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=140.08s)]
*  we've seen, that you can go from zero to 100 very quickly. And I think they [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=145.36s)]
*  need to go back to hiring the brightest and the best. And that's not saying we [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=150.52s)]
*  shouldn't have women or others. I work with some awesome women and some [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=154.66s)]
*  everybody. So it's time to go back to the mission. Real quick, just as a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=159.24s)]
*  follow up, what did they do? They start, you know, we always talk about DEI and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  I think it can become a buzzword. That doesn't mean it's not legitimate. But [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  are you saying they prioritize things like the representation of groups over [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=169.89999999999998s)]
*  the qualification of the individual? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think that's absolutely what's happened. And we've seen that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  demonstrated in the competency of keeping our leaders safe. Remember, we [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=181.6s)]
*  hadn't had an issue since President Reagan. Right. And now we've had two in [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  two months. Houston, we've got a problem. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  One more. I'm short on time, as is always the case on a morning show on Fox [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=192.16s)]
*  and Friends. But the bill by the House to provide equal protection for all [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=196.76s)]
*  candidates is it's the federal government. And so I don't want to talk [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=200.24s)]
*  about a lack of resources. I don't want to talk about. There's a lot of money [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=204.4s)]
*  out there. But is it doable from a logistic standpoint that a presidential [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=207.68s)]
*  candidate has the same Secret Service can as in as a sitting president? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=211.36s)]
*  Yeah. And remember, it needs to be a threat based model. Number one, if [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=217.06s)]
*  you've got a candidate that's really not, you know, out there, does not [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=220.4s)]
*  controversial. He should have or she should have different levels. But it is [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  time President Trump has had the highest level of threat since the beginning. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=227.68s)]
*  And to your point, well, it's going to take about a year or two to hire a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=232.22s)]
*  bunch of new agents to get them trained to get them into the focus. So this is [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=237.36s)]
*  a challenge for leadership. And again, we need real leadership Secret Service [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=241.72s)]
*  and hire the people that you just laid out the ones that need to be hired to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=245.68s)]
*  the Secret Service. All right, Tim Miller conversation this morning. Thank [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=249.76s)]
*  you so much. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian kill me and I means layer heart and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TyRCBjM8yc&t=252.88s)]
