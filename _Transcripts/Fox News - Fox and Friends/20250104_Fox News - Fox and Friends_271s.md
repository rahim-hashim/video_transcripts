# Texas rep praises Mike Johnson after House speaker battle: ‘He is a man of honor’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk)
*  So Mike Johnson will remain the Speaker of the House. His re-election yesterday and folding in dramatic fashion after Republican holdout, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman Keith Self changed his vote last minute. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=7.84s)]
*  Mr. Self is recorded as Donald's. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=12.88s)]
*  Mr. Self, Johnson. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=17.88s)]
*  Texas Congressman Keith Self joins us now. Congressman, good morning. Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=19.88s)]
*  Morning, Charlie. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  So obviously, I think that your goal here was to try to advance the Trump agenda, but of course, Donald Trump had to come off the golf course to make some phone calls to, among other people, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  you. What did Donald Trump say to you? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=48.88s)]
*  Well, I let Mike Johnson know before the vote what I was going to do, and he had President Trump call me, and yes, President Trump was hitting a five iron about the time we talked. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=52.88s)]
*  But what he said, we had a very good discussion about how to advance the Trump agenda. That's what this was all about, because he's going to face a lot of pushback in the Senate. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=62.88s)]
*  Once you start talking about cutting the bureaucracy, controlling spending, he's going to have pushback. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=72.88s)]
*  So this was how do we do that? And frankly, the Republicans have to do better in the House. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=78.88s)]
*  The last two years have been a disaster. We passed bills with Democrat votes, lots of Democrat votes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=83.88s)]
*  Just since Trump won the election, Congress has passed $300-plus billion in new borrowed money spending. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=90.88s)]
*  And so that's why this happened, because we need to make sure that the Republicans do better under Trump, because, listen, the Senate spends money better than anyone else. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=99.88s)]
*  There will be segments of the Republicans in Congress that will not want to, for instance, close the border, other things, control spending. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=111.88s)]
*  That's what this was about. We needed to get the attention of the American people that we are going to be behind the Trump agenda. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=119.88s)]
*  Going through Congress, we have got to do a better job. That's what it was about. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=128.88s)]
*  Now, President Trump and I, to answer your question, we had a very good discussion. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=133.88s)]
*  He understood my concerns. He understands the concerns of the people. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=137.88s)]
*  Frankly, the people who withheld their votes or voted no are the biggest Trump supporters, the people who stand behind him to close the border, to control spending. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=142.88s)]
*  So that's what we had to do. We had to get the attention of people to say, we must do better. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=151.88s)]
*  So do you feel like this whole ordeal was a success in your eyes? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=157.88s)]
*  I think we are miles ahead of where we were yesterday morning. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=162.88s)]
*  Listen, Mike Johnson is a man of character. He's a man of honor. He's made some assurances. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=166.88s)]
*  I will leave that to him to articulate them. But he's made some assurances that we will do better. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=172.88s)]
*  And I think that we must do better, because the nation cannot wait. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=179.88s)]
*  We must get the Trump agenda moving and, frankly, the reconciliation package that he wants within 30 days of taking office. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=185.88s)]
*  That would be the first pushback. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=194.88s)]
*  Did Speaker Johnson make any specific promises that you can share with us? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=196.88s)]
*  I'm going to leave that to Speaker Johnson. He said he hasn't. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=200.88s)]
*  He hasn't, but I believe there are assurances that he has, that we will have a very strong negotiating team that goes up against the Senate for the reconciliation package negotiations. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=203.88s)]
*  Hopefully, again, within 30 days of Donald Trump taking office, because reconciliation is meant to control spending. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=214.88s)]
*  But in Congress, anything can happen. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=222.88s)]
*  So we need a very strong negotiating team right off the bat, 30 days after January 20th or whenever it happens, to go up against the Senate to say, we are going to control spending. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=224.88s)]
*  And these are the parameters. That package is still being developed, so I don't have the details. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=236.88s)]
*  But I know the president wants it to be big. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=241.88s)]
*  He wants it to be a very comprehensive reconciliation package, which is meant, designed to control spending and yet move the Trump agenda ahead. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=243.88s)]
*  Well, we certainly hope so. Congressman Keith Self, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=253.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwtgXNEX2Mk&t=258.88s)]
