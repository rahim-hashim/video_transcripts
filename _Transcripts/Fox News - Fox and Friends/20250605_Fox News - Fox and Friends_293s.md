# Trump's ominous warning to Ukraine after Putin call
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE)
*  President Trump had a stark warning for Russia-Ukraine peace talks after his phone call with Russian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=0.0s)]
*  President Putin, saying, quote, good conversation, not a conversation that will lead to immediate [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=7.32s)]
*  peace. President Putin did say very strongly that we will have to respond to the recent [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=12.56s)]
*  attacks on their airfields. Today at the White House, Trump is expected to discuss the war [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=16.62s)]
*  when he meets with Germany's new chancellor, who is fervently in Ukraine's court, here [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=20.68s)]
*  to discuss Fox News contributor former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman. First, Dan, as [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=27.9s)]
*  a covert operation, this has been brilliant by the Ukrainians, blowing up the bridge underwater [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=32.3s)]
*  and those trucks strategically put inside Russia that blew up those airfields. These [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=37.98s)]
*  are military targets. Yeah, they smuggled in over a hundred drones and reportedly it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=44.3s)]
*  took 18 months to plan this operation. It's an intelligence success for Ukraine, a tactical [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=51.06s)]
*  success of extraordinary proportions and a massive intelligence failure for Vladimir [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=57.02s)]
*  Putin. I'm sure that heads will be rolling, maybe not literally, but figuratively in the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=62.5s)]
*  Russian military and their intelligence service. But remember, this isn't the first major [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=67.62s)]
*  intelligence failure for Putin, who really failed accurately to assess Ukraine's will [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=71.86s)]
*  and capacity to fight from the very beginning. Right. What could they do? They say, we're [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=77.05999999999999s)]
*  going to react strongly to the attacks over the weekend. Okay. What have they been doing [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=81.13999999999999s)]
*  for three years and they've got a million casualties? Yeah, look, they've got a few [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=85.86s)]
*  left bombers, less bombers right now to launch those indiscriminate attacks, which have killed [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=92.25999999999999s)]
*  or wounded tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians. And that's really the goal for [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=97.41999999999999s)]
*  Ukraine. They've got air defenses that stop a lot of these ballistic missiles, but not [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=102.38s)]
*  all of them. And so for Ukraine, it was, let's go hit the archer, the one directing the arrows [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=106.74s)]
*  at us. And maybe we'll have a few fewer arrows directed at our hospitals and neighborhoods [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=111.74s)]
*  and maternity wards as a result. Yeah. Russia is going to a halt. They suspect every truck [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=117.38s)]
*  has drones, every driver is Ukrainian. So they are panicked. Meanwhile, NATO summits [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=122.14s)]
*  going on right now. Our secretary of defense, Pete Hegsteff, who is addressing the member [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=128.02s)]
*  nations and guess what? They are open to now going from two to 5% on the defense commitment. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=132.5s)]
*  Listen, we think very close, almost near consensus on a 5% commitment for NATO in, in, in the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=139.38s)]
*  Hague later this month, we're spending 13% more on our, our defense inside our formations [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=148.46s)]
*  in real capabilities. We need our allies here in Europe and in Canada to step up even [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=154.7s)]
*  more, to step up and take the lead, to recognize the defense of the continent is the core mission. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=162.82s)]
*  So 5% is our message and we will deliver that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=168.45999999999998s)]
*  And you know, it's fascinating the chancellor of Germany wants to do it. The UK is bulking [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=171.5s)]
*  up their military and Poland has surpassed all thresholds. Your thoughts about this, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  the message from Pete Hegsteff. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=183.22s)]
*  It's a great message and it's long overdue. And the more that Europe steps up to provide [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=187.1s)]
*  for the defense that the continent needs, the better prepared they'll be to deter Russia [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=193.5s)]
*  in the future. And the more resources the United States will have to deal with other [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=197.98000000000002s)]
*  threats around the world, specifically in the Asia and Pacific, dealing with the potential [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=202.18s)]
*  for China to launch an attack on Taiwan. So this is a fantastic development. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=206.66s)]
*  Real quick, you have our, you have the president of the United States retweeting a Washington [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=212.06s)]
*  Post column by Mark Thiessen that talked about giving the president the leveraging needs [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  and putting that Senate sanctions bill on his desk that has over 80 senators votes. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=221.82s)]
*  How important would that be? And would those sanctions send the right message to Russia? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=228.9s)]
*  I think it would be the right message. Look, president Trump has tried to entice Vladimir [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=235.3s)]
*  Putin to the bargaining table and so far that hasn't worked. And so we might want to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=239.06s)]
*  look and see what kind of leverage we might have. We might need to use what former secretary [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=243.94s)]
*  of state George Shultz used to like to call, used to like to say that negotiations without [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=248.58s)]
*  the shadow of force behind them results in capitulation. And so I think we need to show [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=254.74s)]
*  that we have more leverage and this is a really good way to do it and demonstrate to the Kremlin [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=260.7s)]
*  that they're going to pay more of a price in the event that they don't agree to the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=265.78s)]
*  ceasefire to which Ukraine already agreed. They lost Syria because they want into Ukraine. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=268.82s)]
*  They also have NATO two more strong members of NATO because they want into Ukraine. Dan, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=274.82s)]
*  thanks so much, Dan. Appreciate it. Dan Hoffman. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtvLL1IMWnE&t=280.7s)]
