# Riley Gaines shreds Nevada for trying to ‘muzzle’ volleyball players over trans player
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY)
*  Today in Battleground, Pennsylvania, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=0.0s)]
*  Riley Gaines and Tulsi Gabbard teaming up [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=2.52s)]
*  to headline a Stand With Women event, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=5.36s)]
*  looking at the future of women's sports. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=8.36s)]
*  As they both say, a vote for Donald Trump [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=10.16s)]
*  is a vote for women's rights and fairness in sports. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=12.4s)]
*  Hosts of the Gaines for Girls podcast on Outkick.com [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=15.76s)]
*  and Independent Women's Voice ambassador, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=19.92s)]
*  Riley Gaines is here to react. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=22.28s)]
*  Riley, it's so great to have you on. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=24.64s)]
*  So just tell us about this event. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=26.28s)]
*  Yeah, so we're super excited to be, of course, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=30.0s)]
*  in the state of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=31.76s)]
*  Key Senate race, of course, we are hoping this is a state [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=33.6s)]
*  that will turn out in masses for Donald Trump. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=35.74s)]
*  People will be there, people like Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=39.1s)]
*  of course, myself, some of the nation's best thought leaders. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=41.4s)]
*  Women like Sage Steele, who has really been pivotal for me, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=45.26s)]
*  has been a role model for me. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=49.36s)]
*  But really what we're here to do is remind voters [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=50.92s)]
*  that we need leaders who stand with women. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=54.68s)]
*  And to stop believing the gaslighting. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=58.16s)]
*  I mean, like we saw last night [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  from Michelle Obama and Kamala Harris. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=62.08s)]
*  It seems very obvious to me that they have almost given up [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=65.32s)]
*  entirely on the mail vote, which I mean, understandably so, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=68.2s)]
*  given the white dudes for Harris ad that we saw, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=72.44s)]
*  given Tim Walz's impromptu shooting incident [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=75.52s)]
*  where he seemingly couldn't even load a shotgun. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=79.64s)]
*  It seems as if they are going all in now [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=83.2s)]
*  on the angry, abortion-obsessed female contingent. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=85.92s)]
*  But I can tell you, as a woman, we care about more [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=90.72s)]
*  than just the right to dismember [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=93.28s)]
*  and abort a developing fetus in the womb. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=95.08s)]
*  We want safe streets, we want low crime, we want low taxes, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=97.92s)]
*  we want world peace, we want school choice, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=101.56s)]
*  we want free speech, we want to protect women [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=103.38s)]
*  and women's sports. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's such a great point. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=107.12s)]
*  When you look at rallies and events for Donald Trump, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  look at the range of issues that they're covering. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=110.62s)]
*  Everything from the economy to crime to education [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=112.96s)]
*  and to women's sports, and their rallies [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=117.36s)]
*  are just abortion rallies, and they're full of really, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  just lies, like calling it abortion care. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=122.72s)]
*  What the heck is that? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=125.96s)]
*  That is the most disturbing euphemism I've ever heard. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=127.63999999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about this, Riley. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=132.64s)]
*  A volleyball player was nearly forced [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=134.56s)]
*  to face a transgender opponent cries [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=136.72s)]
*  and alleges that the school pressured the team to compete. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=141.04s)]
*  Talk to us about what happened there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=144.6s)]
*  Yes, so yesterday I was actually in Reno [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=147.62s)]
*  with the University of Nevada Women's Volleyball Team [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=150.2s)]
*  who stood up against their administration, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  their institution, their coaches, their university [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  during their scheduled game time [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=157.48s)]
*  against San Jose State University. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=159.04s)]
*  Of course, a team that has allowed a male [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=160.56s)]
*  to take a scholarship, a roster spot, a travel spot [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=162.64s)]
*  from a deserving female athlete. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=166.28s)]
*  During their game time, they held a press conference [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=168.84s)]
*  and explained to the community [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=171.08s)]
*  why they weren't going to be participating. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=172.96s)]
*  Of course, they cited reasons of safety concerns. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=175.36s)]
*  Of course, they mentioned maintaining [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=179.04s)]
*  the integrity of women's sports. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  They talked about the emotional toll, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=181.84s)]
*  the emotional blackmail really, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=184.24s)]
*  that their university has used on them [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=185.76s)]
*  to stifle their voices, to muzzle them, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=187.72s)]
*  to get them to comply, but they said, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=190.4s)]
*  look, we know we forfeited, we know we accepted a loss, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=192.28s)]
*  but it's a loss we are willing to accept [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  because some things matter more than victory. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=197.4s)]
*  And those things, of course, include- [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=200.6s)]
*  Is this the only strategy that will work? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=202.08s)]
*  It feels like it is. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=203.96s)]
*  It feels like, until women en masse just say, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=205.12s)]
*  we're not going to do this against men anymore. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  We're not gonna compete against them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, again, this goes back to having cowards, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=213.52s)]
*  weak, need, spineless, morally bankrupt cowards for leaders, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=216.4s)]
*  whether that's the federal government, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=220.44s)]
*  whether that's the NCAA, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=221.8s)]
*  whether that's in corporate America, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=223.12s)]
*  even seemingly our spiritual leaders have become weak. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  And when that's the case, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  we have to stand up for ourselves. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=229.11999999999998s)]
*  I hate it, I hate that these girls [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=230.76s)]
*  are ultimately having to bear that burden, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=232.44s)]
*  but again, it's a burden that's necessary, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=235.04s)]
*  number one, it's worthwhile, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=237.28s)]
*  and I would argue that it's urgent that we do so, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  so I could not be more proud of these girls [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=241.45999999999998s)]
*  and their bravery and their leadership. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the other one that's weak are the feminists. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  And you know what, they're just not useful anymore. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=248.92s)]
*  I've always said, and Riley, I've told this to your face, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=251.82s)]
*  you are the face of the new feminist movement [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=255.1s)]
*  and those young women that were standing up there [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=257.34s)]
*  for themselves and their rights and their safety [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=259.02s)]
*  and the right to just be who they are, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=262.02s)]
*  to own their own gender and claim it for themselves [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=264.65999999999997s)]
*  because they are biologically born that way, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=269.06s)]
*  that's heroism to me. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=271.38s)]
*  Riley, thanks for joining us and good luck with this event [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=273.53999999999996s)]
*  and say hi to Chelsea from us. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=275.58s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=277.02s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XnH6LASYNY&t=277.9s)]
