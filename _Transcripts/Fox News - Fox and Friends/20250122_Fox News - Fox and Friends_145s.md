# Four Israelis stabbed in Tel Aviv terror attack
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU)
*  to a Fox News alert now four people hurt in a stabbing spree in Israel by a Moroccan national who had a US green card. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=0.0s)]
*  What's that about? Trey Yankston is standing by live with details on this terror attack. He's in Israel. Trey, good afternoon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys, good morning. Overnight, four Israelis were wounded during a stabbing attack on a busy street in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=14.64s)]
*  The attacker approached a wine bar before he started the stabbing. He was then chased by bystanders and killed. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=21.84s)]
*  We're learning more about the man's identity. He is Kadhi Abdul Aziz, a US green card holder from Morocco. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=28.64s)]
*  He came to Israel three days ago and was briefly detained for questioning at the airport in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=35.44s)]
*  He was living in the United States before then. This is the second stabbing attack in this city in three days, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  and it comes amid a shaky ceasefire along with the news that Israel's chief of staff, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=46.32s)]
*  Hercei Halevi, is resigning over failures that led to the October 7th attack. He submitted his [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=50.96s)]
*  resignation yesterday and it will go into effect on March 6th. Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=57.12s)]
*  thanked him for his service and said he'll look for a replacement in the days ahead. Now today we [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  do know Israeli forces are still operating in the West Bank city of Jenin. They're going after Hamas [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=67.6s)]
*  and Islamic Jihad cells there, but on a briefing earlier today we learned more information. This [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=73.36s)]
*  raid may last for a number of days and certainly could affect the ongoing ceasefire that is supposed [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  to lead to the release of more hostages this weekend. Guys? So Trey, the problem is there's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=83.92s)]
*  no one there to distribute the aid except Hamas. That's troublesome for the Israelis, right? Because [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=90.0s)]
*  it looks like Hamas is giving out the aid and that fortifies maybe the public opinion that they're [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=95.92s)]
*  still in charge. Yeah, absolutely. These images coming out of Gaza are not good for the Israelis. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  You see Hamas gunmen on top of aid trucks that are driving into the strip as part of this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=108.8s)]
*  ceasefire agreement and it raises real questions about what we've been told by Israeli officials [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=113.36s)]
*  that Hamas is destroyed, that they're not able to govern inside Gaza. They have control of the aid [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=118.08s)]
*  and at this point in the conflict that's the most important thing for Palestinian civilians there. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=123.36s)]
*  And so as we look forward that is why you're hearing so much pessimism about the possibility [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=128.24s)]
*  of phase two of this agreement actually being implemented and you even heard President Trump [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=133.36s)]
*  himself saying he's not confident this ceasefire is going to hold. All right, thanks so much Trey [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=137.68s)]
*  Yanks. It's a very fluid situation as usual. Yes it is. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsmarOZxysU&t=142.4s)]
