# Freed hostage reveals how Trump's win changed his treatment in captivity
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE)
*  Welcome back to Fox and Friends. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=0.0s)]
*  Happy Fourth of July. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=3.96s)]
*  This week President Trump celebrating a lot of victories. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=5.84s)]
*  None more important than welcoming freed hostage Eden Alexander to the White House, to the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Oval Office. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=15.44s)]
*  And Eden Alexander revealed his treatment in captivity by Hamas terrorists after he [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=17.0s)]
*  was captured in Israel. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=23.82s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=26.2s)]
*  Tell the President what happened when they announced that he had won the presidency. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=28.24s)]
*  How the treatment was. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  You changed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  You used it to a new place, a good place. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  Oh. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  People who haven't seen jail. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  So they treated you back as well. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  Because you were coming in and they began, they were afraid of you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=41.599999999999994s)]
*  They weren't you afraid of Mike? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  Did I record that? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  Terrible situation that is. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  So they did that immediately when we won. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  They gave you a better treatment. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=55.24s)]
*  You could say it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=56.24s)]
*  It was a difficult place. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=57.24s)]
*  Well, we're very proud to have helped you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=60.24s)]
*  And the First Lady was, it was very important. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  And the fact that you're American, but, but overall, but the fact that you're American, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  it had a big, big impact here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  Truly a remarkable moment in the White House there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  And extraordinary gratitude for President Trump and his victory because, and we're seeing it in, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=82.24s)]
*  you know, across the Middle East where people recognize that you have a president who is not only cares [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=90.24s)]
*  about justice for all, but also means what he says when he says you can't invade another country, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=97.24s)]
*  take hostages and hold them. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=105.24s)]
*  President Alexander was the last living American hostage who was released from Hamas custody. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=107.24s)]
*  He was from a town in New Jersey. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=113.24s)]
*  There are a number of Americans who are non-living there whose bodies are still being held by Hamas [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=115.24s)]
*  and a number of living hostages that the president is trying to get back as part of this new negotiation [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=121.24s)]
*  with the terrorist group. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=127.24s)]
*  They're hoping by today the group will accept the new terms of the deal so that they can get those people [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=129.24s)]
*  home to their families alive and also to get some of the bodies back to the families as well so they can [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=135.24s)]
*  pay their final respects. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=140.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great point, Katie. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=141.24s)]
*  We believe there's about 50 total hostages left of which 20, I believe, approximately, are still alive. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=143.24s)]
*  And to imagine that they feel as, you know, and Alexander does that, you know, they have a better shot [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=149.24s)]
*  under President Trump that they may actually get released, haven't been there for so long. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=155.24s)]
*  And to think about the fact that he noticed the difference in the way the terrorists were treating him [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=159.24s)]
*  from before Donald Trump won and then after he won. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=166.24s)]
*  And think about what that says about the fear because, you know, in a place like the middle, around the world, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=170.24s)]
*  but particularly in the Middle East, power matters. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=176.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=181.24s)]
*  And they genuinely fear President Trump, not that he wants to start some war that is not necessary, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=182.24s)]
*  but that he means what he says and he is going to defend American interests. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=189.24s)]
*  And they started the war. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=194.24s)]
*  They started the war by, you know, issuing one of the worst terrorist attacks that we've seen in recent memory [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=195.24s)]
*  on October 7th. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=201.24s)]
*  And the president has had a number of different hostages in the Oval Office to tell their stories. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=202.24s)]
*  He's been very touched by that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=207.24s)]
*  He campaigned on getting them back and he's doing exactly that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLa7fGfoQE&t=208.24s)]
