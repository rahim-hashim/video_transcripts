**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ)
*  No easy way out for Biden as he faces backlash from both sides of the aisle over his handling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Israel Hamas war. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=8.2s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=42.4s)]
*  Good. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=43.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=44.4s)]
*  I just could not believe the rumors are true. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  We are cutting off the weapons shipments that you guys authorized, legislatively, months [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  ago to Israel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  And this is not the new stuff. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  This is the old stuff. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  What can you do to stop it? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=54.16s)]
*  Do you want to stop it? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=55.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  And reverse it and ultimately deliver those weapons to Israel, as you pointed out, that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=57.76s)]
*  they paid for over a year ago. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  This isn't something new. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=63.32s)]
*  And so Joe Biden is continuing to cater to this anti-American pro-Hamas wing of his party. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=65.0s)]
*  I mean, think about this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=71.12s)]
*  When you see college campuses taking down the American flag, defacing George Washington's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=72.2s)]
*  statue, those are the people that Joe Biden is trying to cater to right now by ultimately [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=77.96s)]
*  taking back and holding money and walking away from Israel. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=83.12s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats alike support Israel and don't want Joe Biden to do this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=86.76s)]
*  And I think you're going to see action on the House floor to push back on it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  Republicans are drafting the articles of impeachment against President Biden. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  It was brought up by Corey Mills, Congressman Corey Mills. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=97.92s)]
*  And he says this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=100.76s)]
*  The House has no choice but to impeach President quid pro Joe Biden as Vice President Biden [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=101.76s)]
*  was caught threatening to withhold funding and aid to Ukraine unless they fired the attorney [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=107.56s)]
*  general investigating Burisma. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=112.26s)]
*  So he's saying the same thing happened in Ukraine. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  Now he's doing it to Israel by withholding weapons. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=116.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  And Joe Biden himself was critical of previous administrations. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  What he's doing is much worse. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=124.12s)]
*  In fact, if you look, well, what we're going to do is ultimately try to get Israel the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  weapons they need. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=130.0s)]
*  We want to help Israel in their fight against Hamas. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if Joe Biden's forgotten about it, but a terrorist organization backed by [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=133.76s)]
*  Iran known as Hamas invaded Israel, murdered, brutally murdered Israelis, is still holding [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=137.68s)]
*  over 130 hostages, including American citizens. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=143.94s)]
*  Where is Joe Biden standing up to Hamas? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=147.46s)]
*  He seems to want to go after Israel every single day and turn his back on our strongest [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=149.9s)]
*  ally in the Middle East. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=154.62s)]
*  You're going to see strong bipartisan support for Israel in the Congress. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=156.38s)]
*  We've shown it over and over again. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=160.38s)]
*  Used to be unanimous. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=162.02s)]
*  Unfortunately, there is a pro Hamas wing of the Democrat Party that's taken over. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=163.34s)]
*  And you see Joe Biden catering to that far left element and turning away from Israel. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=168.02s)]
*  They're also sanctioning a lot of this anti-Semitism you're seeing on college campuses. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=174.28s)]
*  They're looking the other way towards anti-Semitism, which is a dangerous thing for our country [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=178.6s)]
*  or any country to allow. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=182.68s)]
*  7.6 million Jewish Americans living in our country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=184.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=188.68s)]
*  Steve, thank you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=189.68s)]
*  Great to see you, Congressman. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaCN9WxHqQ&t=190.68s)]
