# Karoline Leavitt: Jan. 6 defendants were 'targeted' by Biden's DOJ
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ)
*  to the North Lawn of the White House and joining us for her first interview as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the new White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt joins us. Caroline [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=3.72s)]
*  congratulations and good morning. Big day for you. Good morning. Thanks so much [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  guys. It's great to see you. Okay so it's a new day not only at the White House [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=12.6s)]
*  but in the Brady briefing room. So when the reporters call on you at your first [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=18.56s)]
*  press briefing, are you gonna have a great big thick binder and when they [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=23.6s)]
*  ask you a question are you gonna have to look for that topic so you know exactly [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=28.72s)]
*  what they want you to say? Well I might bring some notes in with me but my binder [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=32.04s)]
*  is in my brain because I know President Trump's policies and we have truth on [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=37.72s)]
*  our side at this White House but I can confirm that the American people won't [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=42.04s)]
*  be hearing from me today. They'll be hearing from the leader of the free [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=45.4s)]
*  world once again. President Trump will be speaking to the press later this [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  afternoon at the White House and we will have a big infrastructure announcement. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  This man is already doing more in less than 24 hours than his predecessor did [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=56.16s)]
*  in four years. Yesterday was a historic day for President Trump. He signed 42 [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=60.68s)]
*  executive orders, memorandums and proclamations. He took more than 200 [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=66.2s)]
*  executive actions on top of giving three speeches throughout the day and then [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=71.08s)]
*  attending three balls late into the early hours of the morning this morning [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=75.36s)]
*  and he's already off to work again and so the American people have a leader who [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  is delivering on the promises he made to them. President Trump's sending shock and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=84.36s)]
*  awe yesterday with his actions to secure the southern border, to unleash the might [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=88.92s)]
*  of our energy industry and to bring jobs back here at home. So the American people [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=92.96s)]
*  have a strong leader in President Trump. There's no doubt about that. So Caroline [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=98.2s)]
*  let's go back to the inauguration because you're right the president I mean [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=103.6s)]
*  we're still trying to celebrate but it looks like he's off to the races. Talk [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=106.8s)]
*  about the inauguration, talk about the unity that he sent out there and why that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=111.64s)]
*  was important and when did you guys find out that Joe Biden had pardoned his [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=115.72s)]
*  entire family? Well not so coincidentally Joe Biden pardoned his entire family [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=120.88s)]
*  during President Trump's speech so that President Trump couldn't directly [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  respond until much later when Joe Biden was already out of office and I think [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=132.2s)]
*  it's a disgrace that Joe Biden did this on his way out the door. It is an [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  admission of guilt. Four years Joe Biden said that he and his family did not [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=141.2s)]
*  commit crimes but then yesterday's pardons proved that he knew they were [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=146.12s)]
*  guilty and he wanted to protect them in his last hour as president of the United [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=150.72s)]
*  States. But we are looking forward now and President Trump looks forward to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=155.04s)]
*  restoring our Justice Department in law and order in this country and ending the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=158.88s)]
*  weaponization of justice that has taken place against him and his supporters [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=163.32s)]
*  over the last four years under the Biden Harris administration. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=167.6s)]
*  How does that play into President Trump? Does that have anything to do with [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=172.16s)]
*  President Trump pardoning all the J-6ers which is causing some controversy this [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=176.04s)]
*  morning? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=180.48s)]
*  I don't think it's causing much controversy. President Trump campaigned [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  on this promise. It should come as no surprise that he delivered on it on day [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=186.6s)]
*  one and there are people who have been held hostage as President Trump says by [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=190.76s)]
*  the Biden DOJ. Many of them their due process was denied. They were targeted by [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  our Department of Justice while the DOJ turned a blind eye to real criminals who [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  have been committing violent rapes and murders in American communities, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  especially illegal migrant crime. And President Trump took historic action [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=210.32s)]
*  yesterday to secure our southern border and launched the largest mass [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=214.27999999999997s)]
*  deportation operation in history. And so again, President Trump is restoring [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  faith in our justice system while Joe Biden again on his way out the door [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=221.76s)]
*  pardoned his own family. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  Caroline, you mentioned the infrastructure announcement. Can you [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  elaborate on that? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=232.2s)]
*  I won't get ahead of President Trump, but I can assure you assure you that it's [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=234.32s)]
*  going to be a massive announcement and it's going to prove that the world knows [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=239.04s)]
*  that America is back. They have a commander in chief but also a negotiator [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  in chief who will be in the Oval Office today in foreign leaders from around the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=248.72s)]
*  world. Investors from Silicon Valley to Wall Street to Main Street have confidence [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  again in our economy and our markets and in President Trump because they know [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=257.92s)]
*  that here in America he has promised to reduce taxes, to reduce regulation, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  to reduce energy costs and make America the envy of the world. He is going to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=267.52s)]
*  bring investments from all over this globe into our country. And so the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=272.68s)]
*  American people will hear from him later this afternoon on that very subject. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=276.48s)]
*  Right. Caroline, I know you don't want to get ahead of the president, but would [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=280.56s)]
*  there be something concerning the fires in California? Because the president said, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=284.32s)]
*  you know, we want to support that. I know his first trip is going to be Friday to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=290.36s)]
*  Los Angeles, but something has to change there when it comes to the brush, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=294.0s)]
*  the planning. You got people that you got firemen don't even have equipment [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=298.72s)]
*  there. Will that be addressed in this announcement as well? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=302.76000000000005s)]
*  President Trump addressed that yesterday. In fact, he signed an executive order to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=307.32000000000005s)]
*  address the water issues pertaining in California. And he will talk about that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=311.56s)]
*  later this week on his trip when he goes to tour the devastation and ensure that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=316.32000000000005s)]
*  Americans in that state are receiving the help from the federal and especially [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=320.36s)]
*  their state and local government that they need. It's a show. It shows that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=324.76000000000005s)]
*  President Trump is a leader for all Americans, regardless of whether they live [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  in a red state or a blue state. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=332.04s)]
*  Yeah, Caroline, I got a question for you. There's a there's an item in Politico [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  this morning that talks a little bit about how Vivek Ramshami is leaving the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=339.56s)]
*  Doge operation. And the way the Politico article makes it sound, it sounds like [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=344.44s)]
*  he and Elon were not seeing the same vision. And now he's leaving. Vivek is [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=351.32000000000005s)]
*  and he's going to run for governor. What's going on? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=357.56s)]
*  Well, the media always tries to stir up controversy amongst President Trump's [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=362.04s)]
*  team. We are a unified team here. Vivek Ramshami is a brilliant mind and a great [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=365.64000000000004s)]
*  supporter and ally of President Trump. I understand he is moving forward to run [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=370.04s)]
*  for office himself, and that's a great thing for our country. And as for Doge, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=373.92s)]
*  President Trump signed executive action yesterday. Doge will live within the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=378.36s)]
*  executive office of the president, and it's going to do exactly what President [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=382.48s)]
*  Trump intended it to do to restore efficiency in our federal government to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=386.48s)]
*  slash needless regulations and bureaucracy. Elon Musk was here yesterday. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=391.32s)]
*  He's ready to get to work. And this is another promise that President Trump has [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=396.0s)]
*  already made and kept for the American people. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=399.68s)]
*  So, Caroline, a lot of people we've known you, we've known you for a while. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=403.96s)]
*  We're so proud of you. But a lot of the American public doesn't. They're going to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=407.08s)]
*  be watching you every day. Basically, you're 27 years old, the youngest press [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=410.28s)]
*  secretary ever. Congratulations on that. I know you served as the assistant press [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=414.68s)]
*  secretary and a presidential speechwriter. You were under Kayleigh McEnany when she [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=418.76s)]
*  was there, then communications director for Elise Stefanik. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=423.08s)]
*  What is different about Trump going forward versus when you worked for him four years ago? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=426.24s)]
*  It's just very surreal to be back here. I'm so proud of President Trump, proud to [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=433.08s)]
*  work for him and our team here in the White House. President Trump has faced more [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  adversity than any political candidate who has ever run for office in this great [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=440.96s)]
*  country. He survived two assassination attempts and watching him swear in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=445.16s)]
*  yesterday in the Capitol Rotunda was a very surreal moment for myself and my [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=449.8s)]
*  colleagues who worked so hard alongside President Trump over the past couple of [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=454.16s)]
*  years on the campaign trail. And it's just a great day for our country. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=457.96s)]
*  The Golden Age of America has begun and I'm blessed to be here. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=461.56s)]
*  And Caroline, just real quick, President of the United States back in the Oval Office, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=466.4s)]
*  you've known him for a while. What's your personal reflection on seeing him behind [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=470.56s)]
*  the desk for the first time in four years, just hours ago? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=475.2s)]
*  It was an amazing sight to watch, to see him go back into the Oval Office for the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=480.44s)]
*  first time. All of his decor is there. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  Once again, it's the same. You see those family photos behind him at the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=487.44s)]
*  Resolute Desk. And President Trump has been here before. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  So we got right to work. And as he said, in his more than 60 minute press [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=494.2s)]
*  conference, I may add last night in the Oval Office, the most transparent [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=498.56s)]
*  president in history, he talked about how he has arguably more experience than [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eah_cm2VcQ&t=502.4s)]
