# Ex-Dem NYC councilman blasts Mamdani: ‘No place in public life’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w)
*  New York City mayoral candidate Zoran Mamdani still won't condemn the anti-Semitic slogan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=0.0s)]
*  globalize the intifada, but the DNC chairman doesn't seem to think there's anything wrong [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=6.0s)]
*  with that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  There's no candidate in this party that I agree 100% of the time with, to be honest [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  with you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=16.64s)]
*  There's things that I don't agree with Mamdani that he said. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=17.64s)]
*  We are a big tent party. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=20.92s)]
*  Yes, it leads to dissent and debate and there's differences of opinions on a whole host of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=22.28s)]
*  issues. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Former New York City Councilman and former Vice Chair of the State Democratic Party Rory [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=27.68s)]
*  Lantzman joins me now to react. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=32.8s)]
*  Rory, how do you respond to what you just heard the DNC chair say right there? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=34.96s)]
*  Well, good morning. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=38.4s)]
*  You know, unfortunately there's been an explosion of anti-Semitism in this country since October [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=40.36s)]
*  7th on college campuses, in K-12 schools, in the workplace, especially here in New York [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=45.56s)]
*  City. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=50.56s)]
*  And the formula is simple. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=51.56s)]
*  You demonize the state of Israel and then you demonize the Jewish people who support [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=53.46s)]
*  Israel, which is most Jewish people. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=58.46s)]
*  And so a public official like Zoran Mamdani, who the day after the October 7th attacks, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=61.34s)]
*  put out a statement attacking Israel, who refuses to recognize the right of Israel to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=67.94s)]
*  exist as a Jewish state, who supports the boycott, divestment, sanction movement against [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=73.34s)]
*  Israel, who refuses to condemn a phrase like globalize the Intifada. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=78.42s)]
*  He is directly contributing to the anti-Semitism that we're experiencing here in New York. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  And he has no place in public life and certainly not in the Democratic Party, in my view. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=89.1s)]
*  And there are a number of Jewish Democrats who agree with that, prominent ones. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=93.72s)]
*  These are House Democrats that are Jewish, sounding the alarm on Mamdani. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=97.98s)]
*  Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz saying, to not be willing to condemn the term globalize [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=101.9s)]
*  It just demonstrates his callous disregard for anti-Semitism, terrorist activity. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=106.88s)]
*  It's really terribly disturbing and potentially dangerous. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  Congressman Josh Gottheimer across the river there in Jersey says, as Democrats, there [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  should be no room in our party for anti-Semitism or hate speech. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  And Congressman Greg Landsman writing, it's a huge problem. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=122.12s)]
*  It's definitely something that we're worried about. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=125.22s)]
*  So take that and contrast that with a movement literally called Jews for Zoran. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=127.36s)]
*  I hate to abuse this phrase, it's often abused, but it is appropriate here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=134.44s)]
*  Isn't that like chickens for KFC? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=138.84s)]
*  It's really hard to explain and hard to understand. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=141.23999999999998s)]
*  It's important for people who are not Jewish, people who are not in New York City, to understand [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  that that represents a small minority of the Jewish community. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=149.2s)]
*  And they're entitled to their views. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  It's inexplicable to me how a Jew could not believe that Jews have the right to self-determination [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  in their historic homeland and that Jews who believe in that should not be demonized [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=162.46s)]
*  on the college campus or in the workplace. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=167.22s)]
*  But I think that the majority of Jews expect both parties and all of our public officials, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=170.66s)]
*  regardless of the party that they're in, to respect the basic human rights and civil rights [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=175.18s)]
*  of Jewish people. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=182.3s)]
*  And that includes the right to have anti-Semitism taken seriously, to not suffer demonization [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=183.3s)]
*  because of our support for the Jewish state. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=190.26s)]
*  And I would call on all Democrats to respect the needs and safety of the Jewish community [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=193.42s)]
*  at the same level that we respect the safety and the needs of every community. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=202.42s)]
*  Just quickly, before we let you go, will Mamdani's win in the primary and potential win in November [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=206.73999999999998s)]
*  deepen the turmoil within the Democratic Party so much that nationally, this is your party, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=211.01999999999998s)]
*  could you end up losing the midterms because of this, in a midterms that historically the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=216.01999999999998s)]
*  party out of power, which in this case is the Democrats, are supposed to win? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=220.06s)]
*  I can assure you of one thing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=223.74s)]
*  I represented a district in Queens which is a little more suburban. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  And one thing that middle of the road voters are not looking for is more socialism, more [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  anti-Semitism coming out of the Democratic Party. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=237.02s)]
*  It's going to be fascinating to watch. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=240.38s)]
*  Rory Lansman, thanks for being here, being a voice on this, even though it's tough in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=241.7s)]
*  your party right now to be a voice, but you're here for your people. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=245.8s)]
*  And I think that's what's most important because it's a human rights issue. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=249.32s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKG1x_iE26w&t=252.0s)]
