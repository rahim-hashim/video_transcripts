# Biden administration ‘rushing’ to ban TikTok: Trump adviser
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk)
*  All right, TikTok getting one more lifeline, this time from the Supreme Court. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=0.0s)]
*  Justice is saying they'll hear arguments next month over the law that could ban the platform [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=4.84s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=9.78s)]
*  TikTok filing that emergency application to the high court following the CEO's meeting [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=10.78s)]
*  with Donald Trump this week at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=15.36s)]
*  How do you plan to stop the ban on TikTok next month? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=17.92s)]
*  We'll take a look at TikTok. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=22.88s)]
*  You know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won youth by 34 points. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=24.76s)]
*  And there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=30.94s)]
*  Here to react, incoming counselor to the president of Alina Haab. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=36.6s)]
*  Alina, great to see you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=39.32s)]
*  Congratulations on the job. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=40.32s)]
*  I know you're moving to Washington. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=41.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=43.32s)]
*  So this is interesting because it's the Biden administration who's going to go to bat to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=44.32s)]
*  make sure TikTok is banned, right? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=48.84s)]
*  Because this is their argument. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=51.48s)]
*  This was passed under their reign. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=53.64s)]
*  Your thoughts about that? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=56.9s)]
*  First of all, this is the scheme that I've seen and I'll get to TikTok in a minute, but [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  they're fast tracking this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=65.12s)]
*  We've seen that happen. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=66.32s)]
*  They're giving the 19th of January as the deadline that they want it out. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=67.32s)]
*  And I'm not saying there aren't issues there, but we have to look at the value too. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  So the Biden administration rushing this, just like they're rushing bills and shoving [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=76.24s)]
*  people down our throats in the 11th hour. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=80.36s)]
*  That's not surprising to me. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=82.6s)]
*  That's pretty much on par with what they do. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=83.6s)]
*  So TikTok, I know the president loves as a platform, but as a Chinese propaganda device, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=85.52s)]
*  it's pretty strong. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=90.6s)]
*  They're new, they're controlled with a newsfeed. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=91.6s)]
*  You're going to see nothing pro-Israel. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  When the president starts getting into his trade deals with and fighting with China on [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  tariffs, you'll see nothing pro-tariff or pro-America on there. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=100.72s)]
*  Do we want TikTok run by China to have this type of power of 170 million users in the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=105.48s)]
*  United States? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=111.48s)]
*  We would never let them buy ABC or CBS. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=112.48s)]
*  Listen, there's nobody that appreciates fake news or the value of real American voices [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=117.32s)]
*  more than President Trump because he's been a victim of the fake news. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  But with TikTok, it's interesting. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=126.8s)]
*  Do we or does anybody disagree that we cannot have a platform with national security issues? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=128.68s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=133.32s)]
*  Does that mean that it's not unfixable? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=134.4s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=136.28s)]
*  And I think that the right person for that job is President Trump. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=137.28s)]
*  Unfortunately, Joe Biden is trying to get rid of it very quickly so that President Trump [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=140.32s)]
*  cannot save a platform that is widely used. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=143.88s)]
*  However, it has to comply with American security standards. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=146.72s)]
*  It can't be a national security threat. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  And President Trump understands all of that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=156.68s)]
*  And he will examine it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=158.68s)]
*  He will be in communications with these people, unlike Joe Biden, and try and resolve the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=160.14s)]
*  issue in a way that works for Americans. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=164.38s)]
*  Yeah, the real answer is sell it to an American company. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=166.14s)]
*  And Steve Mnuchin, Frank McCourt, Kevin O'Leary all said they have the financing to buy it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=168.89999999999998s)]
*  So just sell it to an American company. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=173.62s)]
*  We all agree it's very effective. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  Next, I would love to talk to you about the nomination process. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=177.1s)]
*  Confirmation hearings to begin in just a few weeks. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=180.38s)]
*  RFK Jr. appears on the Hill for meetings over the last few days. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  When senators are warning that Pete Hicks' hearing is going to be less about what Pete [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=186.9s)]
*  would do as Secretary of Defense, they're going to try to make it all about the personal [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=190.86s)]
*  stuff. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=194.42000000000002s)]
*  What's your, what's the administration, the new administration's plan to help guys like [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  Pete and keep it to the job description? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  First of all, President Trump has a mandate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  He's made that clear. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=207.16s)]
*  These are individuals that are not lone rangers. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=208.16s)]
*  They'll be following the Trump mandate. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=210.3s)]
*  And that's number one. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=212.26s)]
*  by the media as to people's personal lives, which is something we've seen time and time [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=215.05999999999997s)]
*  again. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=220.01999999999998s)]
*  Frankly, they did it to President Trump in 2016. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  And we saw that those cases were dropped. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=223.33999999999997s)]
*  They did it to Kavanaugh. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  They are attacking people that are going to be disruptors, that are going to come in and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=226.7s)]
*  be disruptors in a good way because America needs to be saved at this moment. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=231.06s)]
*  And remember, these people report to President Trump. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=235.14s)]
*  So all the distraction, all the soap opera stuff, as I call it, it needs to stop. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=237.88s)]
*  Do I think they're going to stop? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=242.29999999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=243.82s)]
*  But I think we have the full support of the Republican Party for these people because [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=244.82s)]
*  they understand they've served our country. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=247.54s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, for instance, served our great nation, has been in combat, understands what [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=249.94s)]
*  this is. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=254.06s)]
*  He's not speaking from a place of what if. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=255.06s)]
*  He was there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=256.88s)]
*  So if they want to distract him, try and ruin his family, that's par for the course, unfortunately, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=257.98s)]
*  in this media process and liberal, you know, panic that we see out of D.C. right now because [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=262.9s)]
*  there's a changing of the guards. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=268.78s)]
*  Lena, I think maybe I'm too optimistic. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=270.42s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=272.82s)]
*  I think America has moved past it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=273.82s)]
*  We understand there are personal issues with everyone. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=275.94s)]
*  I think I think you should read the New York Post today and see how the Marines are coming [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=277.82s)]
*  out for Pete, hearing what it was like as a platoon leader. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=281.5s)]
*  And that and those are the types of things that should let people know who they're voting [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=285.14s)]
*  for or not voting for. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=288.84s)]
*  And I just think we're going to get through flying, flying colors. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=290.68s)]
*  There is not one pick that I'm concerned about at this moment. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=294.94s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=297.5s)]
*  I'm talking about the smear campaigns that these poor individuals have to go through [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=298.5s)]
*  and it's unfair, but they are well ready to serve and they're going to follow through [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=301.62s)]
*  with President Trump's mandate when they get confirmed. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=305.98s)]
*  Not if it's going to be an exciting four years. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=308.74s)]
*  Lena, I look forward to seeing you in the right in the middle of it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=310.9s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_XBLszURk&t=313.98s)]
