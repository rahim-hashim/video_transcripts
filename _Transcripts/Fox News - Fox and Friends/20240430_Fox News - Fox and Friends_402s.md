# Columbia protesters smash windows, hang 'intifada' banner
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c)
*  Anarchy overnight as anti-Israel protests storm and occupy an academic building at Columbia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=0.0s)]
*  University here in New York City. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=8.56s)]
*  School leaders failing to keep the peace as pro-Hamas students defy a deadline to dismantle [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=10.28s)]
*  their encampments at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=15.84s)]
*  Didn't do it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=18.96s)]
*  And as anti-Semitic incidents escalate, one New York congressman is calling out his supposedly [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  progressive colleagues for their silence on this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=26.68s)]
*  Mike Lawler from the great state of New York joins us right now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=29.98s)]
*  Congressman, good morning to you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=32.82s)]
*  Good morning, Steve. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=34.82s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=36.22s)]
*  You bet. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=37.22s)]
*  You've introduced the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=38.22s)]
*  What's that going to do? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=40.78s)]
*  It's going to require the Department of Education to adopt the IRA working definition of anti-Semitism [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=41.78s)]
*  and all of its contemporary examples for the Title VI discrimination enforcement cases. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=49.06s)]
*  What we're seeing on these campuses is a rapid rise in anti-Semitism. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=56.260000000000005s)]
*  Back in 1969, Father Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame, sent a letter to faculty and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=61.580000000000005s)]
*  students in which he said, you'll have 15 minutes to cease and desist. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=68.58s)]
*  The failure to do so will result in your expulsion or arrest. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=74.14s)]
*  And that's what needs to happen here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=78.82000000000001s)]
*  This administration, President Chafique, has lost complete control at Columbia University. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=81.24s)]
*  That's why I've called on either the National Guard or the NYPD to step in at this moment [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  because it's clear that she cannot restore order, she cannot keep the students safe. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=92.64s)]
*  And this is a travesty across the country we're seeing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  And right as we approach graduation, this is impacting students all across the country [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  and it needs to stop immediately. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=109.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=111.28s)]
*  And one of the provisions of your bill is that it would cut off federal funds to any [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=112.28s)]
*  school if they do not enforce it with regard to anti-Semitism. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=117.12s)]
*  And it's probably going to pass because you've got 33 Republican co-sponsors, you've got [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=122.84s)]
*  14 Democrat co-sponsors, but Jerry Nadler, the ranking member of the House Judiciary [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=128.28s)]
*  Committee, you would think he would be on board. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=133.52s)]
*  He says your bill is a piece of you-know-what. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=136.86s)]
*  I mean, it's priceless. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=139.66000000000003s)]
*  First of all, his alma mater is Columbia University. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=143.22000000000003s)]
*  And the fact that he has not gone there and demanded that order is restored is pathetic. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=146.14000000000001s)]
*  But Jerry Nadler was a co-sponsor of this very bill just a few Congresses ago. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=152.18s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=158.26000000000002s)]
*  The bill would have done the exact same thing, adopt this working definition of anti-Semitism [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=159.26000000000002s)]
*  so that we can define it and enforce it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=164.38000000000002s)]
*  And the fact that he has turned, you know, done a 180 here is insane. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=166.66s)]
*  And why? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=173.78s)]
*  Because Democrats are petrified of their progressive left base and so concerned about the electoral [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=174.78s)]
*  consequences in November that they're willing to throw Jewish students under the bus. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=180.22s)]
*  It's shameful. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=184.7s)]
*  Well, and to that point, that's why we haven't heard from Chuck Schumer. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=185.7s)]
*  Where's Chuck Schumer on this? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=189.62s)]
*  Where is the president on this? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=191.54s)]
*  He's doing that both sides thing again. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=194.1s)]
*  You think, given the fact that there is essentially a big problem brewing for the Democrats at [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=196.82s)]
*  their convention this summer, this could be 1968 all over again. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=204.18s)]
*  Well, history repeats itself. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=208.74s)]
*  And that's why I referenced the 1969 letter from the president of Notre Dame. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=211.14s)]
*  You're seeing the Democratic Party splinter. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=216.82s)]
*  You're seeing this unrest on campuses. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=219.94s)]
*  I think in Chicago this year, you're going to see protests like you've never seen before. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=222.5s)]
*  And that's what the Democrats are petrified about. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=226.82000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump won 2016 by 40,000 votes in three states. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=229.22s)]
*  Sorry, 80,000 votes in three states. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=233.98000000000002s)]
*  He lost 2020 by 40,000 votes in three states. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=236.38s)]
*  The presidential election is going to be extremely close. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=239.9s)]
*  And that's why Democrats are petrified about Michigan and Minnesota and their base, which [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=243.10000000000002s)]
*  is falling out from under them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=248.82s)]
*  You know, Congressman, there have been some moderate Jewish Democrats who have gone up [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=251.62s)]
*  to Columbia University to support the Jewish students there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=256.66s)]
*  They're on their side. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=260.7s)]
*  They've made it very clear. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=261.7s)]
*  But then right after they showed up, next thing you know, you've got some of the super [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=262.7s)]
*  progressives going in and visiting the campuses to show solidarity with the protesters. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=266.34000000000003s)]
*  They're on the other side. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=272.38s)]
*  Well, it's amazing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=274.14s)]
*  Josh Gottheimer and Jared Moskowitz, two of my close friends, they went there. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=275.62s)]
*  They were told they were not allowed to go into the encampment. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=280.02s)]
*  And yet AOC and Ilhan Omar were allowed to walk among them in part because they believe [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=284.06s)]
*  like they do. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=291.06s)]
*  They support Hamas. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=292.06s)]
*  It is disgusting what has happened within the Democratic Party. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=293.38s)]
*  It's disgusting what's happening on these college campuses. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=297.26s)]
*  They are parroting Hamas talking points. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=299.97999999999996s)]
*  The fact is Hamas endorsed these protests last week while Speaker Johnson and I were [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=302.34s)]
*  standing on the steps of the library at Columbia demanding President Shafik's resignation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=307.42s)]
*  But here's the thing, Congressman. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=313.74s)]
*  You know, there are a lot of universities, and we were just talking to Jonathan Turley [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=315.5s)]
*  about this, there are a lot of universities that offer degrees in activism. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=318.42s)]
*  So essentially something like this is just a, you know, it's a class project, essentially. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=322.98s)]
*  Oh, look, you have paid professional agitators on this campus right now, along with students [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=328.46000000000004s)]
*  who are being taught to protest. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=335.41999999999996s)]
*  And listen, you're entitled to free speech. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=337.82s)]
*  You're entitled to voice your opinion. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=339.53999999999996s)]
*  You're not entitled to threaten other students. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=341.61999999999995s)]
*  And that's what's happening. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  And it needs to stop immediately. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=345.34s)]
*  Well, you know, and one of the things we've been talking on this program for a long time [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=346.61999999999995s)]
*  about how social media, the social media giants are completely unregulated by Congress. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=350.21999999999997s)]
*  But you look at some of the disinformation that has been spread on social media and it's [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=356.44s)]
*  like, OK, are those people from Columbia or are those people from Russia who are putting [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=360.9s)]
*  that stuff out? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=365.62s)]
*  Listen, Hamas is a terrorist organization that uses innocent Palestinians as human shields. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=367.62s)]
*  Israel is not the oppressor. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=374.17999999999995s)]
*  They are not an apartheid state. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=376.06s)]
*  They are the only multicultural, multireligious, multiethnic democracy in the Middle East. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=377.65999999999997s)]
*  They are our closest ally. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=383.26s)]
*  We need to stand shoulder to shoulder with them. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=385.12s)]
*  And these kids, part of the participation trophy generation, need to finally be told [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=387.54s)]
*  enough. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=392.48s)]
*  And that's what needs to happen here immediately. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=393.70000000000005s)]
*  Congressman, thank you very much for joining us from Statuary Hall. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=395.90000000000003s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=399.38s)]
*  We hope that that bill passes promptly. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9I9tUZU1c&t=400.38s)]
