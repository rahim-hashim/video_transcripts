# Former Obama adviser defends Harris’ rambling response about US economy
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg)
*  Fox News contributor and former Obama economic advisor Robert Wolf joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=0.0s)]
*  Robert, thanks for being here. Thanks. Appreciate it. So bring us inside the mind of Democrats, if you would. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=6.18s)]
*  Do they feel comfortable about how Kamala Harris addresses an issue like the economy? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=11.82s)]
*  Because the answer she gave there was almost a carbon copy of the answer she gave on the debate stage, which was clearly [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=16.64s)]
*  prepared for. So how does she go at an issue that's very strong for Donald Trump? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think for the next 60 days post the debate, it's all about both sides being more substantive. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  And I think the economy, as you say, and Will said, and everyone is front and center. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=32.68s)]
*  I actually like when I look at her platform of the four quadrants that you and I have spoken about, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=36.96s)]
*  housing, healthcare, childcare, and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=43.36s)]
*  pricing. And I think, you know, as she mentions, for the economic opportunity, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=46.32s)]
*  we need those to be working and we have work to do in this kind of inflationary environment. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=52.199999999999996s)]
*  There's a lot of work to do. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=58.419999999999995s)]
*  But how does any of that address the gut feeling that Americans have? Because this is what I hear all over the place from even [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=59.419999999999995s)]
*  apolitical people. Hey, I was making money under Trump. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=64.8s)]
*  My money went further. The last three and a half years have been a pinch, have been a squeeze. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=68.28s)]
*  They don't feel like they're hearing anything from her that would address that. So it's a gut like Trump delivered. She didn't. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=73.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, listen, I could go through the facts on data and the economy and who had better GDP and who has better wages. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, you can do all the facts you want. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=85.72s)]
*  No, of course. You've heard that saying, but absolutely. Gut feel you can't change. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=87.16s)]
*  I'm not here to say that we're ringing the bell as Democrats and things are great. Prices are still high. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=91.16s)]
*  The job market's doing well, but it's starting to slow down. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=97.04s)]
*  So there are things we need to do. And I think you have to have a plan. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=100.0s)]
*  Where I would disagree with kind of what you guys have been saying is you may not like her plan, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  but she has a plan. If you listen to the former president, he has no plan. There's just no policy plan. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=108.64s)]
*  He doesn't have a plan on housing if we go one by one. His plan on health care was, I have some concepts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=114.36s)]
*  His plan on inflation is mass deportation, tariffs and protectionism. That's inflationary. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=119.56s)]
*  So I would just say that let's compare the plans. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=126.2s)]
*  So he wants to give you more money back in the form of tax cuts and doesn't want to spend trillions on things like [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=129.4s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act, which actually created inflation, or Green New Deal. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=137.32s)]
*  We printed under Biden and Harris, we printed tons of money and created inflation, which he didn't do. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=141.23999999999998s)]
*  The Green New Deal has never been approved. That's just a hoax that people talk about. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=148.11999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=152.27999999999997s)]
*  Number two, when we talk about deficits and debt, no one's put on more deficits and debts than former President Trump. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=155.16s)]
*  Eight trillion dollars. So the idea that... [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=162.64s)]
*  I mean, Biden said, hold my beer. I mean, both sides have spent more than we have. There's no doubt. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  Both sides spend like it's wild. There's no question we are not fiscally conservative as this country. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=169.83999999999997s)]
*  I'm with you. I'm more fiscally conservative than all the fiscal hawks I debate on Fox. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  OK, I think we should have pay-fors and I think we should go back to looking at budgets. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=180.16s)]
*  That being said, that's not where either side is. So we can't do this magic wand. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=184.72s)]
*  But do you think her touting specific policies will help her change the vibe people have on the economy? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=188.76s)]
*  I think that when she talks about building homes, I think that's critically important. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=196.56s)]
*  Home ownership is the number one thing that everyone wants. They want to have the American dream. They want to own a home. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=201.88s)]
*  I think the idea that we're going to try to build three million homes is a great thing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=207.8s)]
*  We have actually a lack of homes. We've just spoke, you and I, there's a supply demand mismatch. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=211.36s)]
*  Healthcare. Healthcare is one of the biggest expense. It's like 20 percent of our GDP. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  When you look at it, the idea that we have the Affordable Care Act that's brought on 50 million people that are now insured, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=221.0s)]
*  a hundred million that has preconditions that are now insured, insulin at $35. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  I could see the case. See, I love you, Robert, but I'm falling asleep. I'm falling asleep while you give me that list. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=232.28s)]
*  Well, I got to wake you up. Hey, Will, help me out here. Wake him up, will you? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  Most voters are because they're feeling it. They felt they feel cash pours strapped. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=241.2s)]
*  Inflation has crushed them. Let's talk football. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=246.2s)]
*  Okay, let's have Robert back on to talk football with Will and I sometime soon. Maybe then we'll agree. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=249.6s)]
*  He likes to be outnumbered, Pete. He does, right? Exactly. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=255.16s)]
*  All right, we'll try that. Thank you. Always. Appreciate it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=258.04s)]
*  All right, Will, take it over, man. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2lAkS-V_Jg&t=261.15999999999997s)]
