# Sen. Manchin refuses to endorse Kamala Harris over controversial policy position
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs)
*  All right, Election Day is less than six weeks away and later today, Vice President Harris [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=0.0s)]
*  is expected to finally roll out more economic details while courting voters in rural Pennsylvania. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=8.08s)]
*  But that may be overshadowed, overshowed following her call to eliminate the filibuster. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=16.56s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey is live at the White House with the latest [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  for us. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=26.32s)]
*  Hey Peter. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=27.32s)]
*  We can report for once this is actually not a big Harris flip flop this cycle. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=28.32s)]
*  She has had that position about the filibuster since 2022, but it is the thing that she is [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=33.4s)]
*  choosing to make issue one in a rare media appearance that she would blow up Senate rules [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=38.16s)]
*  to bring back the abortion access guaranteed by Roe. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=44.04s)]
*  I've been very clear. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe and get us to the point where we have [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=49.96s)]
*  would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=55.6s)]
*  and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=62.36s)]
*  and not have their government tell them what to do. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=67.24s)]
*  The retiring Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, whose influence always came from never being [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=70.16s)]
*  a sure yes vote for his party's plans, says now that Harris wanting to blow up the filibuster [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=75.32s)]
*  means she has blown her shot at his vote. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=81.52s)]
*  I think I've been very clear my whole career as the 60 vote threshold that we basically [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=86.48s)]
*  operate under in the Senate is essential. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=92.72s)]
*  Would you endorse her for president then? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=96.8s)]
*  I'm not endorsing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=98.8s)]
*  And then we've got this photo. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=101.48s)]
*  Tim Walls, I believe we have the photo, Tim Walls, who is hoping to be the next generation [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=102.72s)]
*  of Democratic leader is meeting with the next generation of Democratic donor Alex Soros. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=107.48s)]
*  His father, of course, has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to Democratic and liberal [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=113.16s)]
*  causes over the last couple decades. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=117.44s)]
*  George Soros, back to you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  There you go. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=121.72s)]
*  Hey, Peter, as you know, so many people have said, and there's a picture of Mr. Soros screen [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=122.72s)]
*  right, Mr. Walls screen left. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=128.88s)]
*  Man, not nice apartment. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  And Peter, breaking news turns out after dodging interviews, Kamala Harris is going to sit [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=136.24s)]
*  down for a live interview at seven o'clock tonight over on MSNBC. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=141.96s)]
*  The same day that Joe Biden sits down in front of the view live on ABC. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=152.0s)]
*  And that's kind of a bummer for Joe Biden. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  He's going to have a studio audience and everything. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=155.8s)]
*  But the shelf life of whatever he says is going to be really limited because Kamala [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=157.8s)]
*  has not done a one on one network TV interview until this evening. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=162.8s)]
*  And so when we talk tomorrow morning, we should have many clips, many high. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, once again, we've seen the real Kamala Harris only when she's talking about abortion, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  change her energy policy, change her policy on the border, change her policy when it comes [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  to economy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  Whenever fracking, she changes all the time. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  But again, for the filibuster, she's remaining consistent because she's talking about abortion. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  That's the only time she can speak off the cuff and have a policy position doesn't change [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=193.8s)]
*  how she feels. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  That one issue. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, and it shows that she believes that the Democrats are going to hold the Senate. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  I saw a preview. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=207.12s)]
*  There's something I dredge right now that says they predict a current prediction is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=209.4s)]
*  that the Democrats are going to win the House, but the Republicans are going to win the Senate. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=213.76s)]
*  So that would throw a wrench into her work. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=220.32s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVhnwqjEIs&t=223.95999999999998s)]
