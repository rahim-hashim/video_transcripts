# Coast Guard officer saves 165 Texas flood victims in first-ever rescue mission
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ)
*  Thank you so much. Right now, Francis search for 10 young campers and a counselor missing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=0.0s)]
*  from Camp Mystic after dead in the flood. Thanks to one American hero, nearly 200 of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=6.48s)]
*  them are safe. The DHS Secretary Kristi Noem saying this Coast Guard rescue swimmer and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=12.0s)]
*  petty officer Scott Ruskin directly saved an astonishing 165 victims in the devastating [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  flooding. This was the first rescue mission of his career and he was the only triage coordinator [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=24.32s)]
*  at the scene. Petty Officer Scott Ruskin has been kind enough to join us this morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=30.64s)]
*  Brother, thank you so much for your service. I mean, you're an American hero. This is what [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=35.4s)]
*  you signed up for was to do missions like this. Tell me about the scene. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=40.24s)]
*  Yeah, of course. So yeah, we got on scene. We were kind of battling with my crew on the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  6553. We were kind of battling some pretty bad weather for maybe five to six hours before [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=50.44s)]
*  we were able to get on scene. Once we got on scene, we were boots on the ground. We [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=55.0s)]
*  made a decision to leave me there. We figured we'd be able to hoist more people out on our [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  helicopter with me not on it. And then I'd be able to help out the scene at Camp Mystic [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  a little bit better. Yeah, just just a lot of a lot of people looking very scared, very [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=68.32s)]
*  tired, cold, missing loved ones, probably terrified, honestly. And I was just trying [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  to be a voice of calm and triage these people and get them to safety as soon as you could. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=78.16s)]
*  Tell me how difficult it was. You know, it's one thing to do triage on an adult, but the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=82.16s)]
*  majority of the people that you were dealing with were kids, young girls. They were frightened [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  about what what had just took place. Yeah, of course. So a lot of them did have some [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=92.36s)]
*  some minor injuries, nothing too serious, thankfully, at least the group I was dealing [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=96.84s)]
*  with. But a lot of them were just, yeah, again, like very scared. And I was just trying to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  console them and give them some sort of comfort. Why? Yeah, again, they're having probably [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  one of the worst days of their lives, but that's just what any Coast Guard rescue swimmer [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=107.64s)]
*  and or any Coast Guard member would have done that situation. So I was just doing my job. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=111.4s)]
*  When you first arrived here, I asked you how bad was the water? How how bad was the current? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=115.04s)]
*  And you said you tried to avoid that as much as possible. Yeah, yeah, we we kind of briefed [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=119.84s)]
*  as a crew prior about my preference if I wanted to get in the water, if I wanted to wear a [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=124.48s)]
*  wetsuit, a dry suit, whatever it may be. And I kind of advocated for myself and said, hey, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=128.2s)]
*  I don't want to get in this water right now. On Friday, on Friday, it was pretty bad weather, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=133.56s)]
*  pretty high floodwater, and I didn't feel comfortable getting in. And I ended up just [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=138.44s)]
*  staying on land to do a lot of the triage with the survivors. There was other crews [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=142.6s)]
*  getting in the water, risking way more than I was getting in. They need that recognition [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=145.6s)]
*  as well. So, you know, Scott, a lot of people in the audience, they don't understand the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=149.84s)]
*  severity of the water. They don't understand how this changed within a matter of an hour. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=154.56s)]
*  Can you someone that's experienced with the water and understands and respects the water [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=160.74s)]
*  and the power that it has? Can you explain to our audience the difficulty that those [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=164.66s)]
*  kids have to deal with? And they weren't experienced at all. Right. Yeah. I mean, yeah, even as [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=170.38s)]
*  a professional rescuer, I was nervous about getting in the water. I can't imagine how [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=174.46s)]
*  eight, nine, ten year olds like these kids are heroic. Like they need to get the credit [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=178.02s)]
*  they're getting that they need. You know, they like some of the camp counselors were [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=182.46s)]
*  saving lives before we even got there. So I mean, without those guys, it would be a [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=186.46s)]
*  lot worse situation. It's still very tragic. But I think there definitely needs to be a [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=190.62s)]
*  lot of here is in praise to the survivors. They were saving themselves. Scott, tell me [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=194.58s)]
*  what sticks out to you the most being here. I've covered a lot of school shootings with [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=201.06s)]
*  children there. What impacts you the most being out there on the scene? Yeah, I mean, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=206.94s)]
*  I think the biggest thing for me is a lot of these kids. They're just kids. You know, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=213.06s)]
*  I was a kid once. I'm only 26. I got a lot of younger family and friends. And yeah, it's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=216.46s)]
*  just like, wow, like that could have been my family in that situation. So I need to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=221.38s)]
*  do as best of a job as to help them get them out of the situation. Scott, thank you so [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=224.78s)]
*  much for serving your country and just being a hero. We really appreciate you. Yeah, happy [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  to do so. And I know everyone else would be happy to be here. You be safe out there. Thank [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  you, sir. Appreciate you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1BnodPa4QQ&t=236.98000000000002s)]
