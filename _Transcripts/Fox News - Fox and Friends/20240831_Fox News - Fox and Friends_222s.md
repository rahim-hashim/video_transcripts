# Laken Riley murder suspect asking to suppress some evidence ahead
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs)
*  The illegal immigrant suspected in the killing of Georgia College student [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=0.0s)]
*  Lakin Riley is now asking to suppress multiple pieces of evidence ahead of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=4.36s)]
*  the trial because his lawyers say it was all taken illegally. That includes two [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  cell phones, genetic and physical information, social media data and even [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=13.92s)]
*  his Google location data. Here to react, former federal prosecutor Andrew [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=18.52s)]
*  Cherkasky. Andrew, thank you for being here. I'm glad to be here. I'm glad to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=23.76s)]
*  thank you for being here. I don't understand how they can say that this [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=28.68s)]
*  evidence, even if it was taken illegally, the DNA evidence seems to be [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=33.32s)]
*  pretty important to the case. If they are allowed to keep this out, does [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=37.8s)]
*  that really risk the opportunity to prosecute this guy? Well, despite [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=41.56s)]
*  Lakin Riley's accused killer being an illegal alien, he will be afforded the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=46.04s)]
*  full rights of our constitution. And so with that we will see his defense [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=50.96s)]
*  counsel file whatever motions or whatever efforts they can to defend [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=55.4s)]
*  their client as we typically do in these cases. Just because he's filed a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  motion to suppress this evidence doesn't mean that it's a particularly [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=63.76s)]
*  strong issue or that they're going to win this issue. This is quite ordinary [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=66.72s)]
*  in a matter of this complexity when he's facing these very grave charges. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=70.52s)]
*  So I think it's too early to come to a conclusion that this is going to go [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=75.48s)]
*  badly for the prosecution or something along that line, especially with the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=78.64s)]
*  DNA. It sounds like the DNA they're challenging because it hasn't excluded [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=82.48s)]
*  another person as well. That's the sort of thing that a jury can sort through [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=87.36s)]
*  that a judge typically won't keep the evidence from going forward to the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=91.36s)]
*  jury. So I see this case moving forward. I think that this evidence is going to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=95.04s)]
*  come in largely. There's more litigation that has to happen with regard to what [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=98.82000000000001s)]
*  exactly is going to come in and what might be kept out by the judge. Do you [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=103.36s)]
*  have any idea what makes them say that these pieces of evidence were taking [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=107.44s)]
*  unlawfully? Is it he wasn't read his Miranda rights or there wasn't a [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=111.2s)]
*  translator? Or you know, can you pontificate on what those facts are? Or [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  do you know? Sure. So they're saying that there's a lack of probable cause. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  So that causes me to think that when the police got there, they were there [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=122.56s)]
*  alleging that the police were just kind of randomly plucking him and saying that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  he was the suspected killer or that they in getting the search warrants, they [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=130.6s)]
*  were putting too many pieces of the puzzle together without enough evidence. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  That's the sort of thing that I think the judge is going to have to sort [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  through quite deeply. The reports on this or the specifics of what the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=142.44000000000003s)]
*  defense is saying hasn't been made public. As far as I can tell, at this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=146.52s)]
*  point, the prosecution will get a chance to respond to all of this and there [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  will be a formal hearing to this. So this is just kind of the initiation of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  the complaint saying that there wasn't probable cause for the various search [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  pieces that occurred during the course of the investigation. So the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=164.44s)]
*  trial isn't until November. Say these pieces of evidence are withheld from [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=168.88s)]
*  trial. Is there enough evidence otherwise to get a conviction here? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=172.4s)]
*  Well, there is pretty overwhelming evidence with the number of different [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=177.32s)]
*  things that happened during the murder, before the murder and afterwards. And [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=182.24s)]
*  so I think that the prosecutors are going to have a mountain of evidence [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=187.04s)]
*  to bring against the accused killer. The problem ultimately comes in if the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=190.68s)]
*  judge were to keep some of this evidence out, what would the prosecution [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=196.12s)]
*  do? There are appellate options that they can take prior to trial if it's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  something that would essentially change the nature of the case. So I think [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=203.6s)]
*  there's a lot to be done here and the prosecution's got a strong case. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=207.68s)]
*  Andrew, thanks for joining us. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ReRzltduYs&t=210.48000000000002s)]
