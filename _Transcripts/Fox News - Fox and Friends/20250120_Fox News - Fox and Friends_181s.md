# Bidens greet Trumps for pre-inauguration tea at White House
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM)
*  We're about to see a moment here together. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=0.0s)]
*  What a beautiful shot that is of the White House. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=4.0s)]
*  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, 18 acres there. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=6.0s)]
*  And the president-elect's motorcade is now underway. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=9.0s)]
*  They are holding for a moment just to make sure that Joe Biden [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=13.0s)]
*  and Dr. Joe Biden are positioned at the North Portico to receive them. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=16.0s)]
*  We know that J.D. Vance and his wife Usha are already inside [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=21.0s)]
*  with Kamala Harris, the vice president, and the second gentleman, Doug Emhoff. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=24.0s)]
*  We've got about two more hours for those titles. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=28.0s)]
*  Bill? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=30.0s)]
*  You know, Dana, the clock says 1147 for the swearing-in, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=32.0s)]
*  so by my watch we're, yeah, two hours away from that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=36.0s)]
*  And based on the current schedule, it looks like we are right on time, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=41.0s)]
*  and we need that, Dana, because it's written in the Constitution. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=47.0s)]
*  So stand by. We'll watch it together now from the North Portico, the White House. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=51.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=58.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=60.0s)]
*  Move the truck, move the truck, move it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=91.0s)]
*  Move the truck. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=99.0s)]
*  Move the truck. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=120.0s)]
*  Hey. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=123.0s)]
*  All right, please. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=125.0s)]
*  Well, it's tea time, Dana. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=149.0s)]
*  It's the moment we've all been waiting for? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=151.0s)]
*  Go ahead, Bill. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzcadhdlCM&t=153.0s)]
