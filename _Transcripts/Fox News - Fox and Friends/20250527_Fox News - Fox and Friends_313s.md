# Trump lashes out at Putin as tensions escalate: 'He has gone absolutely CRAZY'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8)
*  This morning growing tensions between President Trump and Russian President Putin after fresh attacks on Ukraine over the weekend [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump posting quote. He has gone absolutely crazy [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=7.68s)]
*  He is needlessly killing a lot of people and I'm not just talking about soldiers [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=10.96s)]
*  Missiles and drones are being shot into cities in Ukraine for no reason whatsoever [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=15.9s)]
*  Retired lieutenant general Keith Kellogg serves as Trump's special presidential envoy for Ukraine [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=21.76s)]
*  He joins us now general Kellogg. So great to see you this morning. Thank you for joining us. So [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=27.14s)]
*  What you know, obviously you have a lot of back and forth right now between Trump and Putin and it's getting a lot more [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=33.34s)]
*  pointed but what is left for Trump in his arsenal to get Putin to do [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=41.260000000000005s)]
*  You know to the peace table to do what Trump wants [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=48.18000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Charlie, thanks for having me. It's great to be with Fox and Friends this morning. Look he's doing a lot [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=51.5s)]
*  I mean and his frustration is understandable because what's happened when you attack cities like that and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=56.5s)]
*  Indiscriminately kill women and children through missile attacks or drone attacks. That's a clear violation of the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=63.5s)]
*  1977 Geneva Protocol, which is designed to prevent that of course the Geneva Convention is that so the rules on warfare [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=69.5s)]
*  And that was an added on to it and the Russians have signed up to that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=75.5s)]
*  The United States has signed up to it and the Ukrainians have signed up to it as well [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=78.5s)]
*  And that is to prevent that indiscriminate killing that you've seen over the weekend women and children [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=82.5s)]
*  You know, let's give full credit to President Trump [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=87.5s)]
*  You know, he's done more in 120 days than the previous administration did 1,200 days and we've had meetings on [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=89.5s)]
*  Trying to bring peace to the region in Jeddah in Riyadh [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=97.5s)]
*  In Paris and in London and in recently in Istanbul to try to bring the parties together for them to come up with a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=101.5s)]
*  Plan to go forward and bring peace and we we have the we've got the Ukrainians in the position where we believe [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=107.5s)]
*  That this is what they want and we have a 22-point plan [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=114.5s)]
*  That we brought back out of London that kind of outlines where we want to go and frankly [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=117.5s)]
*  We think it's a good plan because neither side wants to go to war [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=123.5s)]
*  And frankly, we think it's a good plan because neither side really likes it [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=127.5s)]
*  Well, I think you make progress when both sides don't like it and it's gone well [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=130.5s)]
*  So we're pretty confident there and I think when you ask what he needs to do, I think he just needs to keep at it [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=134.5s)]
*  It's frustrating. I know that but the only guy that can do this is President Trump. I really believe that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=140.5s)]
*  I've said that repeatedly on air [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=145.5s)]
*  Right based on his personality who he is. He's the one who can bring peace to the region. It's not going to be easy [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=147.5s)]
*  You know negotiations are never easy but there's there's nowhere this war is going to end through violence through killing of soldiers on either side [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=153.5s)]
*  Right. It's gonna come down to negotiation. That's where you have to be [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=160.5s)]
*  Yeah, so although it does sound like the Putin side of things is not in any it looks like they're not really moving [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=163.5s)]
*  This is what? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=170.5s)]
*  Putin spokesman had to say we're grateful to the Americans into the President Trump personally for their assistance in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=172.5s)]
*  Organizing and launching these negotiation process. Of course at the same time [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=177.5s)]
*  This is very crucial moment which is associated of course with the emotional overload of everyone absolutely and with emotional reactions [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=181.5s)]
*  So that it doesn't really sound to me like the Russian side of things that they're particularly open to trying to get to the bottom of this [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=188.5s)]
*  Yeah, Charlie, I think that's reason you have to continually apply some type of pressure to the Russians to get them to the tables [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=201.5s)]
*  And make a determination on where they want to be when President Trump spoke with President Putin a little over a week ago [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=210.5s)]
*  The Russians said they were going to come up with what they call a memorandum. It's what I call a term sheet [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=217.5s)]
*  What a term sheet means is okay. This is how we get to peace. We've got that from the Ukrainian side [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=223.5s)]
*  We need to get that from the Russian side. Then what you do is you meld them together. You put them together [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=228.5s)]
*  And say okay, what does this look like? What is not acceptable? What's acceptable? Where can you go to to bring it together? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=233.5s)]
*  Once we do that, once we get their term sheet or memorandum, then we'll put it together and there's going to be another meeting [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=238.5s)]
*  And we believe it will be probably in Geneva. We would like to have had it in the Vatican [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=245.5s)]
*  And we're pretty set to do something like that. But the Russians didn't want to go there to the Vatican [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=249.5s)]
*  So I think Geneva may be the next stop and then you eventually go to somewhere where you get all three major leaders of all the parties [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=255.5s)]
*  You get the President, President Putin, President Zelensky together and hammer this thing out [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=261.5s)]
*  And come to some type of signed document that ends this war. This war has gone on way too long [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=265.5s)]
*  President Trump is absolutely right. You've got to stop the killing. When you look at the numbers that are just [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=270.5s)]
*  I call it industrial strength killing. When you've got casualties on both sides that are over one million [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=275.5s)]
*  And right now conservatively we're talking 1.2 million. That is stunning when it comes to it. That is beyond World War II numbers [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=281.5s)]
*  And that's what I call industrial strength killing. And then there's the showing of the cities within discriminant violence [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=287.5s)]
*  It's just not the way to go. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=293.5s)]
*  Okay, General Kellogg, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=296.5s)]
*  Thanks, Charlie. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD2zrJ6uKk8&t=300.5s)]
