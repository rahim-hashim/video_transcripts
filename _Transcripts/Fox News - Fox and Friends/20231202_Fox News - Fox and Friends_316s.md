# We are 'taking the fight back' to Hamas, says IDF spokesperson
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert. Israeli airstrikes resuming overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=0.0s)]
*  You see the smoke rising right now from Gaza. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=4.0s)]
*  As they set the stage for a Gaza without Hamas rule, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=7.0s)]
*  Israel is arranging for a buffer zone within the Strip to protect Israelis from any future attacks. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=11.0s)]
*  Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner joins us now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=17.0s)]
*  Colonel, thank you for being here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=22.0s)]
*  You know, after this pause, what does the offensive look like? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=23.0s)]
*  I believe Hamas has effectively abandoned the north. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=27.0s)]
*  Fighters have surely regrouped in the south. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=30.0s)]
*  What does it look like next? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=33.0s)]
*  So the idea is indeed engaging Hamas wherever they are. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=35.0s)]
*  And I would say they are still in the north. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=39.0s)]
*  There are still areas in the north in Jabalia, in Sajahia, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=41.0s)]
*  and other places around the north that they are still operational. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=44.0s)]
*  And indeed we are seeking them out. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=49.0s)]
*  And as you rightly pointed out, we're conducting airstrikes engaging. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=51.0s)]
*  We have over the last 24 hours targeted some 400 targets of Hamas, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=55.0s)]
*  whether it be explosive devices, booby trap locations, command and control positions, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=62.0s)]
*  staging areas that where Hamas are conducting their activities. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=69.0s)]
*  So, yes, we are taking the fight back to them. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=72.0s)]
*  The operational pause collapsed because Hamas refused to live up to their word, basically, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=75.0s)]
*  to release the women and children, the 17 women and children that are still being held captive today. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=82.0s)]
*  And so we are on the offensive. We're taking the fight to Hamas. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=88.0s)]
*  Indeed, the outcome of this war needs to be two. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=91.0s)]
*  All of our hostages are brought home, every last one of them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=94.0s)]
*  And second, of course, a Gaza Strip that Hamas does not govern [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=98.0s)]
*  as a staging ground for terrorism against Israel and our civilians. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=103.0s)]
*  Colonel, you're starting to hear... [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=107.0s)]
*  I know you don't want to get into American domestic politics, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=109.0s)]
*  but we're starting to hear more calls for a more precise bombing, a different approach. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=112.0s)]
*  And will you change the way you're operating in that goal of destroying Hamas? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=119.0s)]
*  As you move into the South, where a lot of refugees have fled, how do you adapt to that? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=124.0s)]
*  We are very attentive to our American allies. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=129.0s)]
*  Of course, the professional relationship between the military to military is outstanding. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=133.0s)]
*  I would say even intimate. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=138.0s)]
*  Of course, we are conducting our operations in order to achieve our goals [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=140.0s)]
*  in accordance to the laws of armed conflict and, indeed, conducting those [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=144.0s)]
*  with a distinction between the civilian population, the noncombatants, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=148.0s)]
*  and the terrorists, Hamas terrorists, that are hiding behind the civilians, the civilian population. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=153.0s)]
*  What we've seen in the last two months now, and two months to the day, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=158.0s)]
*  is a reality where Hamas have extensively, or as a concept of operation, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=163.0s)]
*  placed their capabilities in mosques, in schools, in hospitals. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=170.0s)]
*  These are where Hamas' locations are. This is where they are positioning themselves. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=175.0s)]
*  And we approach these positions within the realm of the laws of armed conflict, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=179.0s)]
*  exactly in order to minimize the civilian casualties, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=185.0s)]
*  but to maximize the damage on Hamas as a terrorist entity, as a governing authority, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=188.0s)]
*  and as a terrorist organization that has no regard for life, Israeli or Palestinian. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=193.0s)]
*  Well, no doubt. I mean, they are happy to exploit the West's way of fighting war [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=197.0s)]
*  by using civilians at every aspect. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=202.0s)]
*  We're now hearing reports that the IDF says six of the hostages have died [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=204.0s)]
*  while being held captive in Gaza. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=209.0s)]
*  How do you keep the pressure on while also creating the incentive [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=211.0s)]
*  for Hamas to give up these hostages? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=217.0s)]
*  So all of the hostages were released due to one thing, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=220.0s)]
*  due to the imposing, impending military power that we displayed and implemented [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=223.0s)]
*  in the six weeks prior to the operational pause. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=230.0s)]
*  So now we are increasing the pressure. We are engaging Hamas. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=234.0s)]
*  They know we are coming. We intend on delivering the hostages home. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=238.0s)]
*  We intend on removing Hamas from controlling the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=242.0s)]
*  And it's very clear that those that were released would not have been released [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=247.0s)]
*  were it not for the IDF's operational actions. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=251.0s)]
*  This is why the pressure is increasing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=256.0s)]
*  This is why we are targeting Hamas. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=258.0s)]
*  This is why we are targeting their leaders and seeking out from, I would say, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=260.0s)]
*  from Yekhiya Sinwar, the mastermind of the massacre of the 7th of October, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=265.0s)]
*  all the way down to the last terrorist, the Nukhba terrorist [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=269.0s)]
*  that came into our communities on the 7th of October. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=272.0s)]
*  So we are seeking out the entire organization as a governing authority, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=276.0s)]
*  as a terrorist entity, but also as the people that are holding our civilians hostage. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=282.0s)]
*  So it goes hand in hand. Those two goals of the war go hand in hand. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=288.0s)]
*  And we intend on implementing them both. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=293.0s)]
*  Yeah, continue to pray for the hostages, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=295.0s)]
*  and I hope you kill every last one of those Hamas terrorists. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=297.0s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, thank you very much, sir. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=300.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=303.0s)]
*  You got it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1TVNa8rovg&t=305.0s)]
