# Tulsi Gabbard: This should be disturbing to all Americans
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E)
*  Yesterday, a historic day in our nation's capital, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=0.0s)]
*  nearly 300,000 right there on the National Mall, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=2.7s)]
*  showing their solidarity for the Jewish state [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=5.84s)]
*  at the March for Israel rally. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=8.28s)]
*  Somewhere out there, I can't see her right there, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=11.28s)]
*  but she's live in her studio. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=14.64s)]
*  Our next guest, former Democratic Congresswoman [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=16.28s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, taking this video and saying [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=18.2s)]
*  the absence of Biden and Harris was felt among thousands, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=21.28s)]
*  and she joins us right now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=25.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=26.44s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=27.28s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=28.12s)]
*  Why'd you have to go? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=28.94s)]
*  It was critical to me to be, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=29.78s)]
*  take advantage of the opportunity to stand in solidarity [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=32.74s)]
*  with the Jewish people, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=35.5s)]
*  to stand up against this incredibly unprecedented level [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=37.2s)]
*  of antisemitism that's taking over the world, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=40.58s)]
*  and to stand strongly against the radical [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=43.68s)]
*  Islamist terrorists, not only in Hamas, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=46.22s)]
*  but around the world who are both the short-term [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=48.28s)]
*  and long-term threat to all of our peace, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=51.32s)]
*  security, and freedom. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=53.82s)]
*  You were right out there, and you were with some friends. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=55.38s)]
*  I'm sure the people you talked to talked a little bit about, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  and you mentioned it a moment ago, antisemitism. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=61.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=64.0s)]
*  Since the October 7th attack, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=64.84s)]
*  antisemitic assaults on Jewish Americans [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=67.04s)]
*  have gone up 400%. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  I was talking to some kids yesterday. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=71.88s)]
*  They're afraid to go to school [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=73.28s)]
*  because something bad might happen. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=76.08s)]
*  And that's what was so striking to me, Steve, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=77.72s)]
*  about being there with nearly 300,000 people. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=79.84s)]
*  I did not get that sense of fear in the crowd. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  I know you were there as well. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=88.18s)]
*  Obviously, there's a natural security concern. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=90.12s)]
*  I was wondering, okay, where are the counter-protesters [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=92.44000000000001s)]
*  gonna be, is there someone who could potentially [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=95.0s)]
*  conduct a violent attack on this mass group of people? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=98.54s)]
*  It would just take one. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=100.68s)]
*  It would only take one, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  and you would have a mass casualty incident. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  I served in a medical unit in the Army in Iraq, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  and this is the kind of thing that we prepared for. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  But what I experienced was really powerful. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  It was almost 300,000 people. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=112.62s)]
*  The feeling in the air was one of hope, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=115.56s)]
*  of love, of joy, of an appreciation for life and freedom. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=118.5s)]
*  And I think it's an important thing to take note of, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=122.42s)]
*  the contrast between that versus the violent mob [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=124.9s)]
*  of pro-Hamas protesters that we're seeing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=129.98000000000002s)]
*  all over the world who have to cover their faces [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=132.02s)]
*  as they go and graffiti walls and threaten [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=135.12s)]
*  and beat people up and even kill people [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=139.0s)]
*  as they launch their anti-Semitic attacks. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=141.62s)]
*  It's a fundamental difference between the rest of the world [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  who values life and freedom and peace [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=147.68s)]
*  versus these radical Islamists who celebrate [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  death and martyrdom and seek to kill anyone [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=152.56s)]
*  who does not adhere to their radical application of Islam. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=155.24s)]
*  I was talking to some members of Congress [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=160.08s)]
*  over the last couple of days about what's it like [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  to work in Congress where they are clearly on Israel's side, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  but there are a number of their colleagues [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=170.12s)]
*  who are on the other side. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  They are pro-Hamas for the most part. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  Also, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=176.98000000000002s)]
*  apparently this is a Fox News digital story, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=180.06s)]
*  you can read about it at Fox News Digital. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=182.54000000000002s)]
*  She is part of a secret social media group [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=184.78s)]
*  where the members have glamorized Hamas in its war, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=187.74s)]
*  in the battle with Israel. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=192.06s)]
*  That's the headline, look for it on Fox News. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=193.94s)]
*  Does that surprise you? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=196.06s)]
*  It is terrible, but sadly it doesn't surprise me. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  We have seen, go back to Ilhan Omar's statement [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=200.86s)]
*  about 9-11 as a day when some people [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=203.9s)]
*  did some things. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=206.0s)]
*  There's a group of people within Congress [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=207.39999999999998s)]
*  who are blatantly and openly [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=209.72s)]
*  Islamist terrorist apologists, period. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  That shouldn't surprise any of us [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=214.48s)]
*  because they have made themselves known. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  What should be surprising and disturbing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=217.76s)]
*  to the American people is how many people [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=219.72s)]
*  in my former party, in the Democrat party, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=222.76s)]
*  which is one of the main reasons I left, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=224.48s)]
*  are also Islamist apologists [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  or who are so afraid of being labeled as Islamophobic [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  that they won't stand up and say what is necessary [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  to speak the truth about the threat [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=235.68s)]
*  that Islamist terrorists, whether it's Hamas, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=237.62s)]
*  Al-Qaeda, ISIS, or al-Shabaab and other groups [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=239.58s)]
*  pose to freedom and peace loving people everywhere. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=242.86s)]
*  But now is the time to stand up. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=246.3s)]
*  And while yesterday was fantastic [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=247.86s)]
*  with 300,000 people who showed up, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=249.66s)]
*  yesterday can't be the end. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=252.18s)]
*  It's gotta be continued. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=253.34s)]
*  I hope that they do these kinds of rallies [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=254.46s)]
*  for peace and love and freedom and life [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=257.26s)]
*  in cities across America and around the world. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=259.18s)]
*  And we all need to stand with the Jewish people [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=261.66s)]
*  and with each other right now. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=263.96s)]
*  It's critical. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=265.08s)]
*  Thank you very much for stopping by, Tobi. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3E8FzcCe0E&t=265.98s)]
