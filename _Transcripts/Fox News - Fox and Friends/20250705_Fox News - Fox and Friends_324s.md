# 'FEAT OF DIPLOMACY': Devine says signing of 'big, beautiful bill' a 'remarkable victory'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc)
*  President Trump celebrating the Fourth of July by signing the big beautiful bill into [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=0.0s)]
*  law while noting this was merely the latest in a long line of victories. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=4.72s)]
*  I think had probably the most successful almost six months as a president and the presidency. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=11.66s)]
*  I think they're saying it was the best six months and I know for a fact they're saying [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  the last two weeks there has never been anything like it as far as winning winning winning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=23.12s)]
*  Joining us now to discuss is Fox News contributor Miranda Devine. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  Great to see you this morning Miranda. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=34.0s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=35.0s)]
*  So this is a pretty big deal, huh? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=40.56s)]
*  It's certainly considering what a narrow margin the Republicans have in Congress. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=42.0s)]
*  It was quite a feat of diplomacy, internal diplomacy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  There was a lot of antagonism towards the bill from many Republicans who feared that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=51.48s)]
*  it didn't cut spending enough. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=57.76s)]
*  But this is all of Donald Trump's signature moves and he certainly sort of attached his [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  credibility and his presidency to it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=67.66s)]
*  So if it had not gone through it would have been a disaster. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  But between him twisting arms and Speaker Johnson's sort of whispering of his colleagues [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=72.96s)]
*  very well and I think people like Suzy Wiles even behind the scenes, they pulled it off [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=79.16s)]
*  and that is really a remarkable victory. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=84.72s)]
*  You know it is interesting the degree to which I feel like President Trump has taught Republicans [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=88.0s)]
*  to fight including going after the press and doing everything he can to help shape the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=93.17999999999999s)]
*  narrative of stories. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=102.88s)]
*  And so my hunch is that going forward President Trump is not going to just let the media portray [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=105.48s)]
*  this legislation the way they're going to portray it which is always in favour of Democrats. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  I think they're going to do, the selling job is not over just because he signed the bill. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  He's going to lead the effort for all Republicans to sell this bill to the American people. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  And you saw how hysterical the Democrats were talking about millions of people were going [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=132.08s)]
*  to die and people were going to lose Medicare. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=138.16000000000003s)]
*  They do that, it gets amplified by the left wing media and then of course half the country [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=142.12s)]
*  or probably less but they get terrified and they believe it all still and they get hysterical [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=149.08s)]
*  themselves. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=156.0s)]
*  I think it's just like with all these things, it's just a steady chip chip chip with Trump [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=157.32s)]
*  like a bullet at a gate defending his policies, defending himself and now unlike in his first [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=163.2s)]
*  term he has people around him who really do believe in him and they're going out, they're [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=169.4s)]
*  young, they're energetic and they're just as fierce really, at least some of them as [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=174.64s)]
*  he is. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=179.44s)]
*  Yeah and so as he's going to be, and Republicans are going to be pushing this bill and they're [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=180.44s)]
*  going to be defending it as a very pro-America first agenda. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=185.64s)]
*  You have Democrats on the other side who are stuck having to defend now in New York City [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=189.84s)]
*  their nominee for mayor of New York City who is a full blown unapologetic communist in [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=197.84s)]
*  the free press, a former support or present supporter of AOC telling the free press, I [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=206.68s)]
*  helped AOC win, I understand the fantasy that Zerran Mamdani is selling, quote, their hearts [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=216.68s)]
*  are in the right place but sadly the promises that charismatic people like Mamdani and AOC [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=223.24s)]
*  are selling are not the solutions that young people are seeking whether from lack of life, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=229.68s)]
*  or just pure ignorance, they fail to realize that programs offering free everything have [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=235.72s)]
*  to be paid for and nothing is free. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=240.67999999999998s)]
*  So Democrats are going to have to be defending these people and these socialist policies [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  while Donald Trump and Republicans are promoting an America first patriotic agenda. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the Democrats are in just a death spiral and all they have are these attractive [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=257.68s)]
*  holograms and Mamdani being the latest who are complete frauds and phonies. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=265.08s)]
*  I mean you saw the other day that his application to Columbia had his ethnicity as African American. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=271.12s)]
*  You know, he just in every sense is a construct and nothing is real and you know if any of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=281.4s)]
*  these young people voting for him knew anything about history they would know the bloody toll [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=288.4s)]
*  of communism around the world, millions, hundreds of millions dead. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=294.8s)]
*  A hundred million in a hundred years dead. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=298.12s)]
*  Right, there you go. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=301.32s)]
*  Miranda Devine, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=304.32s)]
*  Sorry we have to keep it rolling. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=308.16s)]
*  That's alright, thanks Charlie. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=311.16s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qMmVdibKc&t=312.16s)]
