# 'America first!': Chicago residents confront far-left mayor at fiery city meeting
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8)
*  Great. So let's talk a little bit about what is going on across the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=0.0s)]
*  And we've been talking about this for a while, where, you know, for the last [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  during the entire Biden administration, for the most part, it does appear to many [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=8.56s)]
*  people that there are southern borders wide open. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=12.32s)]
*  You come to the southern border, you get in, you go, you mill about the country. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  We've got problems here in New York City, a lot of sanctuary cities, a lot of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=18.96s)]
*  sanctuary states. And one of the places where it has kind of hit the fan [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=22.96s)]
*  finally is Chicago. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  And you know all about this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=31.2s)]
*  Yeah. So I've been talking with the residents of Chicago for a while when it [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=32.56s)]
*  was just once my home state of Texas. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=37.12s)]
*  But Greg Abbott decided, look, if you guys want to be sanctuary, I'm going to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=39.04s)]
*  bust these migrants to your communities. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=43.32s)]
*  And it really put a damper on the message of we just want to be loving of all [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  people and everyone come in our community. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=51.28s)]
*  Well, one resident is upset. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=53.72s)]
*  She spoke out at the meeting the other day. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=56.440000000000005s)]
*  She's been multiple, right? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=58.64s)]
*  Multiple showed up to the city council and they really left the mayor have it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=60.68s)]
*  Let's watch it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=65.56s)]
*  Here you are with another really popular tax hike. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=68.12s)]
*  Trying to push the have lots to house your president, illegal immigrants. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=70.88s)]
*  You told Trump you ain't going to blink. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=75.16s)]
*  Well, we ain't either. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=77.36s)]
*  You are. You are going down in history as the roast mayor in America. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=78.76s)]
*  Typically, I'm here and I'm fussing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  I want to say thank you to the city council. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=85.56s)]
*  Our mayor is embarrassing us all around the world. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=87.76s)]
*  And you all took the power back from him to say the city of Chicago is out of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=91.56s)]
*  the business of funding illegals. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  They want the option to get sanctuary cities off the books. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  They want their entire Chicago doing it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  The tightest seeing the illegal immigrants in their, in their airports, at [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  their police stations, overwhelming the cops who are unrespected and they're [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=109.48s)]
*  dramatically understaffed. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=113.2s)]
*  And this mayor thinks he's speaking for the people, the African-American [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=114.56s)]
*  community, by saying that we are not going to cooperate with ICE. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=117.56s)]
*  We are not going to build distrust between our law enforcement as well as [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=122.2s)]
*  ICE and start turning on our people as if enforcing the law is turning on your [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=127.28s)]
*  people. And these people show up to the city council and go, stop helping me. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=131.72s)]
*  You want to help me? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=135.72s)]
*  Sanctuary status, sanctuary city status. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=136.72s)]
*  Make it yesterday's news. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=139.16s)]
*  Number two, they were all saying positive things about Trump. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=140.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=143.12s)]
*  I think Trump, I just hope that he understands that people are open to him. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=143.68s)]
*  And if he goes back now and says, listen, what blocks are the problem? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=148.56s)]
*  You know, where's the, where's the crime? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=152.16s)]
*  Where's the, where's the unrest? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=153.76s)]
*  Where, where are the issues? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=155.44s)]
*  And with Tom Homan, we don't need you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=156.6s)]
*  I don't need your vote anymore. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=158.72s)]
*  I just want to help you guys out. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=159.72s)]
*  So get the momentum to force this mayor to sober up or kick them out. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=161.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=165.36s)]
*  And the thing is the Chicago is the most debt addled city in America. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=165.76s)]
*  While it's number two in its city border, second to this Gotham city that we're [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=169.8s)]
*  sitting in right now, it's number one when you factor in that those residents [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=173.16s)]
*  have to assume the Illinois debt to they're unique in that position. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=176.84s)]
*  So each resident there is responsible for per year over $43,000 of debt. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=180.0s)]
*  And you add in the liabilities. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=185.6s)]
*  That's 12% of their income. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=187.0s)]
*  So what you are asking them to do, which by the way, they have the highest sales [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=189.04s)]
*  tax and they need major metropolitan city in the country too. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=191.88s)]
*  So you're telling those residents, your crime is among the highest in the country. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=194.84s)]
*  Your sales tax is the highest. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  Your property tax is among the highest. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=199.8s)]
*  And you are responsible for the highest amount of debt in the country. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=201.52s)]
*  But hey, let me prioritize illegal immigrants. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=205.44s)]
*  Let me prioritize this community that is here illegally over your needs. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=208.48s)]
*  And let me tell you, by the way, you're not black if you don't vote. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=212.84s)]
*  Well, I think you layered on the top of you got the kids that can't read and write [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=215.56s)]
*  within the community. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=219.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=220.88s)]
*  They shut down the schools. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=221.16s)]
*  Say we have no money to fund it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=222.28s)]
*  We have zero money to fund these extra schools. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=223.88s)]
*  And then suddenly all these illegals come in and they open school back up for the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=226.56s)]
*  illegals. OK, then you got the community. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=229.8s)]
*  They say health care is a priority, but they shut down the health center. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  We go down there. They said, we're going to reopen it, put the illegals there. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=235.0s)]
*  These are criminals already in the city shootings every how many times have I [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=239.32000000000002s)]
*  done reports? And now the illegal gangs are robbing the gangs that are in [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=243.8s)]
*  Chicago already. So it's a big. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=249.0s)]
*  The gangs are fighting the American gang. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=251.52s)]
*  That's right. Well, just just just to back up. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  You did this story. You said there's no money to keep my money physicals. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=254.44s)]
*  This boys and clubs type place open and they say, you know, it gets open. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=258.04s)]
*  Well, where'd you get the money from? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=262.12s)]
*  Oh, for illegal immigrants. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=263.12s)]
*  What? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  That's why they're upset to the groin that is. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, in an hour ago, we talked a little bit about how [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=269.56s)]
*  you will find it on X, how the breakdown is of how much the illegal [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  migrants are costing each and every American. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=278.24s)]
*  And this year alone, one hundred and fifty billion dollars when you look at all [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=280.88s)]
*  the costs and taxes and stuff like that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  The cost to Americans is one hundred and fifty billion dollars. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=287.56s)]
*  That breaks down to almost a little under ten thousand dollars per illegal [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=292.8s)]
*  migrant in the country today. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=298.64s)]
*  There are that many. You you, Lawrence, were talking to a woman by the name of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=300.52s)]
*  P. Ray earlier, right? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=305.0s)]
*  And she was fired up. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=306.24s)]
*  You saw it at that council meeting. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=307.76s)]
*  She joined us earlier. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=309.2s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=310.2s)]
*  Our main issue is it affects our bottom line. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=311.92s)]
*  It is very cold in Chicago right now, and there are people all around the city [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=315.04s)]
*  getting up to go make the doughnuts. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=319.2s)]
*  We're not going to work to pay for illegals. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  They chose to come here illegally and we don't allow people to feast off of their [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  criminality. Our goal is to get this border closed and to get every [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=328.76s)]
*  unnecessary expense off of the budget lines in the city of Chicago. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=333.52s)]
*  We can't afford it anymore. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=338.48s)]
*  So what they want to do, what I believe my mayor is doing, is attempting to use [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=340.12s)]
*  the social and political capital of my community to advance the immigrant [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=344.4s)]
*  community. We are America first. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=348.79999999999995s)]
*  I am an eighth generation American, so I'm extremely invested in making this [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  country great, as is everybody else in my community. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  Please don't racialize this deportation fight. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=359.28s)]
*  Know that every American is in lockstep with this because we deserve to spend our [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=362.12s)]
*  money in better ways. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, well said. Don't racialize this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=368.67999999999995s)]
*  Well, and if you speak up, oh, wait a second, because you don't, it's something to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=371.16s)]
*  do with your race. No. In fact, the people that get hurt the most are the ones that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=374.72s)]
*  have the leave. They don't put them in the nice areas. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=378.44s)]
*  We saw what they did in Martha's Vineyard. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=381.24s)]
*  They were there at least 48 hours and they were out of there. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=383.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, they're putting them in every other community. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=386.08s)]
*  I just think this is an amazing issue, though, because part of the reason why we [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=388.92s)]
*  saw the last election, the coalition of Democrats when it came to minorities, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=392.84s)]
*  it's shattering right now. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=397.0s)]
*  They're going to Trump. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  They're going to the Republican Party, giving it a second shot. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=401.12s)]
*  Can you imagine voters telling you that this immigration issue is one of the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=404.08s)]
*  reasons why? And the mayor, they're paying absolutely no attention to it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=408.56s)]
*  It's like they want to lose. They don't want to compete for those voters anymore. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=413.36s)]
*  But the voters aren't putting up with it anymore. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  And the in Chicago, the mayor's message is tone deaf to people like P. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=419.24s)]
*  Ray right there. However, here in New York City, there's [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=424.32s)]
*  listen, there's a new sheriff in town. His name is Tom Homan. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=428.44s)]
*  He's coming into office at noon on January 20th. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=431.32s)]
*  Tom Homan, it sounds like, wants to meet with Mayor Adams. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=435.32s)]
*  Mayor Adams wants to meet with him. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=438.6s)]
*  And yesterday, after a spate of crime, the mayor of New York City [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=440.52000000000004s)]
*  made it very clear. You come into this country illegally. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=445.64000000000004s)]
*  If you're an illegal migrant, you do something where you break the law. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=449.16s)]
*  We should send you back. Listen to the mayor. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=452.84000000000003s)]
*  We're willing to take migrants and asylum seekers that are not criminals [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=455.44s)]
*  and commit crimes. We're willing to take them, but they have to be able to work. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=459.4s)]
*  So I don't understand why this wasn't clear to the previous administration. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=463.44s)]
*  Those who are here committing crimes, robberies, shooting at police officers, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=468.2s)]
*  raping innocent people have been a harm to our country. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=471.92s)]
*  I want to sit down and hear the plan on how we're going to address them. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=476.76s)]
*  Those are the people I am talking about, and I would love to hear from you. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=480.88s)]
*  I would love to sit down with the board of czar and hear his thoughts [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=484.72s)]
*  on how we're going to address those who are harming our citizens. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=488.8s)]
*  This is not a new position, you know, because in the state of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=492.6s)]
*  in the in the era of cancel culture, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=497.0s)]
*  no one's afraid to be honest about the truth. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=501.16s)]
*  Well, cancel me because I'm going to protect the people of the city. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=503.76000000000005s)]
*  Mayor Adams, he was wide open to help out. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=509.16s)]
*  And by the way, he was the one who was on the Biden train early. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=510.84000000000003s)]
*  And when he started saying, I need some federal funding for the illegal [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=513.36s)]
*  immigrants that you're letting in, they stopped returning his calls. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=515.92s)]
*  Next thing you know, his phone gets taken on the street by the FBI [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=519.24s)]
*  while he was boarding a plane to go meet with the president, with other mayors. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=522.2s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=524.88s)]
*  It was a culture and they kicked them from kicked them off [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=525.76s)]
*  of being a co-chair of the campaign. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=528.36s)]
*  Yeah. So he says, I'm not going to be a warring with this administration. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=530.76s)]
*  I'm going to be working with this administration. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=535.44s)]
*  And that's good. Look, I know it didn't pay him any good to be friends with Biden. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=538.28s)]
*  It's probably going to be a survival mechanism to be friends with Trump. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  But also, I do think his instincts was I have no money to pay for 57000 [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=546.24s)]
*  people that are here. We've covered. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=551.5200000000001s)]
*  We've closed five shelters in the last two weeks, which is relatively good news. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=553.2800000000001s)]
*  But hundreds of thousands are passing through on a daily basis. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=557.08s)]
*  The buses have stopped. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=560.44s)]
*  But the immigration, the illegal immigrants have not. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=561.88s)]
*  I disagree with him on the other thing. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=564.24s)]
*  He said, you can come here if you as long as you can work. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=566.12s)]
*  You can't kick. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=569.4s)]
*  We can't welcome people here and we can't get them jobs. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=570.6800000000001s)]
*  It's rewarding bad behavior. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=574.28s)]
*  It's all linked. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=576.28s)]
*  If you start giving them jobs, they're going to keep a magnet. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=577.12s)]
*  Yeah, I take such issue with all of that, as he stood in front of signs [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=580.0s)]
*  that said the lowest subway crime in history, except for the pandemic years [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=583.12s)]
*  that we have inherited. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=586.84s)]
*  He said subway crime down 15 percent in November. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=588.64s)]
*  While Daniel Penny awaits his verdicts right now for stepping in [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=591.6s)]
*  where the gap was left by that mayor, he says now he wants to work [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=595.24s)]
*  with the administration. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=598.4399999999999s)]
*  Where was he protecting the citizens for the last four years and more? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=599.36s)]
*  And the thing is, he says he's waiting for Tom Homan to bring solutions. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=603.0799999999999s)]
*  I wish my mayor had brought solutions when all of us were drowning. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=605.72s)]
*  I sat next to this woman at dinner recently who still bore the scars [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=609.16s)]
*  from her hundreds of stitches after being punched in the face right here [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=613.48s)]
*  in Midtown with a person with glass wrapped around his. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=616.88s)]
*  She was an elderly woman. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=620.16s)]
*  That happens all day, every day in the city. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=621.52s)]
*  And you're telling me just now you want to hear what Tom Homan has to say. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=623.56s)]
*  What about Lake and Riley's murderer that cycled through the Roosevelt Hotel? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=626.48s)]
*  What about those migrant kids that stabbed that men in Times Square [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=629.7600000000001s)]
*  you reported on earlier today? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=632.32s)]
*  And all the police officers that have borne the brunt of ambushes [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=633.7600000000001s)]
*  and crimes at the expense of laughing illegal immigrants [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=636.88s)]
*  baked into the juvenile system. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=640.1600000000001s)]
*  So they're purported to be innocent and they're called boys. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=641.84s)]
*  I mean, I'm sorry. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=644.2800000000001s)]
*  It's too little too late for Mayor Adams for the people of New York. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=645.24s)]
*  I'm worried you're going to peak now. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=649.24s)]
*  You have outnumbered to do later. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=650.36s)]
*  You've got to keep some in the quiver. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=651.5200000000001s)]
*  Emily, you are fired up. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=653.2800000000001s)]
*  You know, so Mayor that came from Mayor Adams has the opportunity [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=654.92s)]
*  to follow the footsteps of Mayor Rudy Giuliani. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=658.68s)]
*  And what Mayor Rudy Giuliani did was he had an emphasis [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=661.3199999999999s)]
*  on quality of life crimes. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=665.9599999999999s)]
*  It started out as little stuff. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=667.7199999999999s)]
*  But when you're walking around on the streets in New York City [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=669.1999999999999s)]
*  because of the migrant crime, which is substantial these days, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=672.28s)]
*  it impacts everybody and it impacts decisions of [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  am I going to go to the doctor's office today by myself? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=680.28s)]
*  Do I feel safe? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=683.3199999999999s)]
*  Am I going to go to the grocery store? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=684.6s)]
*  You know, the lady down the hall got robbed by those people [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=686.6s)]
*  and they never found him. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=690.36s)]
*  And the police said there's nothing we can do. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=691.4s)]
*  If Mayor Adams turns it around, he could be a great mayor. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=693.64s)]
*  And maybe he's ready. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=697.16s)]
*  So President Trump, President-elect Trump pushing to fix the border crisis [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=699.84s)]
*  that reportedly cost taxpayers more than one hundred and fifty billion dollars [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=704.36s)]
*  last year alone. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  Blue cities like Chicago feel in the pinch as its own mayor [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=710.0400000000001s)]
*  vows to keep resisting Trump. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=713.76s)]
*  The taxpayers, they're just fed up. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=716.4s)]
*  Here you are with another gritty public tax hike, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=719.6s)]
*  trying to push the half-lots to house your president illegal immigrants. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=722.4399999999999s)]
*  You told Trump you ain't going to blink? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=726.68s)]
*  Well, we ain't neither. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=728.88s)]
*  You are going down in history as the worst mayor in America. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=730.28s)]
*  Typically, I'm here and I'm fussing. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=735.04s)]
*  I want to say thank you to the city council. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=737.08s)]
*  Our mayor is embarrassing us, y'all, around the world. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=739.3199999999999s)]
*  And you all took the power back from him to say the city of Chicago [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=743.08s)]
*  is out of the business of funding illegals. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=748.84s)]
*  You just heard from Chicago resident P. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=752.8s)]
*  Ray Easley. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=754.84s)]
*  She was at that city council meeting and she joins us now. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=755.92s)]
*  So P. Ray, a couple of months ago, I went to Chicago and I saw a community center, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=758.52s)]
*  a health center and some schools that were shut down because of funding. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=762.52s)]
*  But magically, they were reopened for legal. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=765.56s)]
*  Is that why residents are so frustrated right now? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=769.72s)]
*  Well, that's a portion of it. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=773.76s)]
*  Our main issue is it affects our bottom line. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=775.2s)]
*  It is very cold in Chicago right now. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=778.32s)]
*  There are people all around the city getting up to go make the donuts. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=780.8000000000001s)]
*  We're not going to work to pay for illegals. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=784.6800000000001s)]
*  They chose to come here illegally and we don't allow people [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=787.2s)]
*  to feast off of their criminality. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=790.52s)]
*  Yeah. So your mayor had a different thought. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=792.96s)]
*  This is what he said back in November. Let's watch. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=795.36s)]
*  We're going to defend the people of this city because look, his attack, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=799.84s)]
*  let's be very clear, the president elect, former President Trump, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=804.28s)]
*  his threat is not just towards new arrivals and undocumented families. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=809.52s)]
*  His threats are also against black families. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=815.32s)]
*  A threat against black families. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=818.6s)]
*  How would you respond? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=820.48s)]
*  I think it's very disrespectful for him to say that. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=822.32s)]
*  I am an American Negro woman [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=825.52s)]
*  and our people are not immigrants. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=828.36s)]
*  We are migrants, of course, in the very literal sense, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=830.5200000000001s)]
*  because our grandparents came here during the Great Migration. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=834.0400000000001s)]
*  This is why we're really pushing for an end to race, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=836.88s)]
*  because when you say black, that can mean anybody. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=841.0400000000001s)]
*  They told us the Kamala was black. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=843.2800000000001s)]
*  And yes, there are black people who will be deported, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=844.88s)]
*  but that has nothing to do with the American people. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=847.6400000000001s)]
*  Our goal is to get this border closed and to get every [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=850.5200000000001s)]
*  unnecessary expense off of the budget lines. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=854.44s)]
*  In the city of Chicago, we can't afford it anymore. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=858.0s)]
*  Well, it's a matter of affordability, but then it's just common sense. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=861.52s)]
*  So our kids can't read and write within our communities. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=865.32s)]
*  You got people that are living in poverty. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=870.32s)]
*  So we have real issues in our community. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=872.64s)]
*  And it seems like they continue to say they can't fix it because of a strain. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=875.68s)]
*  But yet they find the money magically to fund all these other programs [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=880.44s)]
*  for the migrants, right? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=884.84s)]
*  So what they want to do, what I believe my mayor is doing, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=886.52s)]
*  is attempting to use the social and political capital of my community [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=889.4399999999999s)]
*  to advance the immigrant community. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=893.36s)]
*  And we've been seeing this since the 1800s. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=895.92s)]
*  Frederick Douglass warned us about this years ago. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=898.28s)]
*  And so now we're here. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=901.1999999999999s)]
*  We're a much more informed and enlightened people. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  And we are America first. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=906.04s)]
*  I am an eighth generation American, so I'm extremely invested [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=908.4399999999999s)]
*  in making this country great, as is everybody else in my community. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=912.0s)]
*  Please don't racialize this deportation fight. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=916.04s)]
*  Know that every American is in lockstep with this [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=918.76s)]
*  because we deserve to spend our money in better ways. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=922.36s)]
*  Christmas is coming. Why should we have to pay extra in taxes? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=925.12s)]
*  Yeah, over 50% of the country are for mass deportations. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=928.28s)]
*  You would think that the mayor would change after such a mandate [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=932.08s)]
*  as the last election. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=935.04s)]
*  I haven't seen people in Chicago so fired up until this issue right here. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=936.16s)]
*  I think it's going to be a game changer. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=942.0s)]
*  P. Ray, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=943.88s)]
*  Thank you for having me this morning. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=946.12s)]
*  You got it. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdzcy8tNwT8&t=947.56s)]
