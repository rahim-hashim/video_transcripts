# Elon Musk calls out Dem's $2 BILLION in NGO funds uncovered by DOGE
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0)
*  Elon Musk sitting down for an exclusive interview alongside seven members of the Doge team, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=0.0s)]
*  giving a peek behind the curtain of President Trump's cost-cutting department. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=6.08s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=10.0s)]
*  You've got to watch the whole thing. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=11.0s)]
*  The team consists of a wide range of experts, including a former rocket scientist. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=12.48s)]
*  You think he'd be qualified to fix the government, and I believe he is. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=16.72s)]
*  And one of the co-founders of the runaway success Airbnb, a billionaire who's donating [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=19.88s)]
*  his time. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=25.96s)]
*  The Doge team also consists of engineers, and they all have the same goal, to slash [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=27.02s)]
*  wasteful government spending. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=32.1s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=33.74s)]
*  Well, this is a revolution. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=34.74s)]
*  And I think it might be the biggest revolution in government since the original revolution. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=37.379999999999995s)]
*  But at the end of the day, America is going to be in much better shape. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=41.74s)]
*  America will be solvent. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=46.7s)]
*  The critical programs that people depend upon will work. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=48.9s)]
*  And it's going to be a fantastic future. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=53.36s)]
*  Are we going to get a lot of complaints along the way? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=57.78s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=59.26s)]
*  You know, one of the things I learned at PayPal was, you know who complains the loudest and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=60.26s)]
*  with the most amount of fake, righteous indignation? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  The fraudsters. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=68.53999999999999s)]
*  That'sâ€”it's a tell. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  You understand. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=70.53999999999999s)]
*  You understand. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  NGOs that are crazy, like the $2 billion to Stacey Abrams NGO that basically didn't [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  exist, and suddenly gets $2 billion awarded from the federal government. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=77.38s)]
*  She says, why? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=81.06s)]
*  And there are many such cases like that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=82.74s)]
*  I love that he brought that up. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=84.3s)]
*  But it's true because, you know, the more and more we discuss this, I'm like, do these [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=87.02s)]
*  people think we're stupid? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=89.74s)]
*  I mean, they've been spending all this money. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=90.74s)]
*  Meanwhile, we've kind of highlighted all the tragedies that are happening in this country [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=92.74s)]
*  as it relates to different communities. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=96.74s)]
*  You've got homeless veterans. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=98.74s)]
*  You've got a crisis when it came to the wildfires in California. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=100.13999999999999s)]
*  You got a crisis in North Carolina. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=104.02s)]
*  And all these people are like, we have no money. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=105.89999999999999s)]
*  We have no money. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=107.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, they have found all of these other programs to give money to. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=108.5s)]
*  And somehow they all link back to Democrat organizations or Democrat donors or politicians. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=112.62s)]
*  So Doge savings so far, they say, and you can go on the website doge.gov.com, $130 [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=119.06s)]
*  billion. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  Their goal is to save $4 billion a day, and they are doing it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  They're talking about systems. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=129.9s)]
*  And when it comes to talking about modernizing systems, think about it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=131.9s)]
*  You come in, you're there two years, maybe four years as Treasury Secretary. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=135.66s)]
*  Once in a while you stay the whole time. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=139.34s)]
*  There's no motivation to reform things. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=141.06s)]
*  And as soon as you get on a roll, it makes them suggest somebody else is in charge. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=143.54s)]
*  So what you do is you continue with that system, which explains why manually Social Security [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=147.26s)]
*  is handled, why it takes so costly to explain to people how to retire, let alone to actually [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=151.78s)]
*  retire, and there's fraud within the system. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=158.26s)]
*  So with every taxpayer so far has saved $807. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=160.94s)]
*  But what he's doing different that's caused controversy, it's not one of those typical [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  things like Simpson-Bowles and says, we studied for two years and here's how you save. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=169.9s)]
*  And at the end of it, no one did it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=173.62s)]
*  He's saying, I'm cutting it in real time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=175.54s)]
*  Catch me if you can, but you can examine what I'm doing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=178.22s)]
*  But just know I'm doing it to make the government not cut back on services. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=181.84s)]
*  If you look at how many people have been fired, they say .05. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=186.26s)]
*  Many people have decided I'm taking the payout, I'm going to leave on my own. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  Here's a little on Social Security. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=194.66s)]
*  He said this over and over again. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=197.1s)]
*  I am not cutting Social Security. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=198.5s)]
*  I'm changing the way Social Security is done and cutting out the fraud. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=200.73999999999998s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=204.45999999999998s)]
*  The two improvements that we're trying to make to Social Security are helping people [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  that legitimately get benefits, protecting them from fraud that they experience every [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=209.94s)]
*  day on a routine basis, and also make the experience better. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=215.1s)]
*  And I'll give you one example is at Social Security, one of the first things we learned [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=219.62s)]
*  is that they get phone calls every day of people trying to change direct deposit information. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=225.3s)]
*  So when you want to change your bank account, you can call Social Security. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  We learned 40% of the phone calls that they get are from fraudsters. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=234.9s)]
*  40%? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=239.70000000000002s)]
*  Almost half. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=241.38000000000002s)]
*  What we're doing will help their benefits. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=242.38000000000002s)]
*  Legitimate people, as a result of the work of Doge, will receive more Social Security, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=244.82000000000002s)]
*  not less. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=249.14000000000001s)]
*  I've heard a lot of news about rifts, about people getting fired. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  At this moment in time, less than .15, not 1.5, less than .15 of the federal workforce [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=256.58s)]
*  has actually been given a rift notice. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=264.78s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=267.09999999999997s)]
*  Who could be against this, you guys? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=268.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, who could be against reforming these systems? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=270.38s)]
*  And by the way, didn't you also, when they were explaining the whole Social Security [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=272.65999999999997s)]
*  thing, there's this giant mine and there's paperwork and there's carts and people are [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=276.02s)]
*  going through files and they're ancient like us and they have manila folders. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=280.18s)]
*  For the retirement. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=284.58s)]
*  For the retirement stuff. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=285.58s)]
*  And you're going, and this is the same system we had in 1950, it's like, what's everybody [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=287.06s)]
*  been doing until now? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=291.58s)]
*  But Rachel, did you hear what he said? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=292.58s)]
*  You have to, in the federal government, to retire. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=295.21999999999997s)]
*  You have to take a course to be able to retire because the process is so complicated. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=297.53999999999996s)]
*  I've never heard of anything like that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=303.5s)]
*  In the private sector, when you retire, you know, HR gives you the paperwork, it's digitized, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=305.58000000000004s)]
*  and you leave, everybody does a victory lap and that's it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=310.5s)]
*  Apparently with the federal government, they found some way to make your last days complicated. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=314.42s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=318.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, if people come in and they're defrauding the government and they're able [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=320.78000000000003s)]
*  to change the direct deposit for your family and all of a sudden you're not getting your [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=323.98s)]
*  checks, even if they restore your checks, that money is still going to that person's [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=328.1s)]
*  account. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=332.02000000000004s)]
*  They're defrauded most likely by people outside the country. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=333.02s)]
*  Now HHS is turned into Pentagon. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=336.02s)]
*  HHS is going to cut, according to RFK, is going to announce cutting of 10,000 employees. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=339.14s)]
*  Now why would he do that? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=343.46s)]
*  Well the three largest Medicaid insurers receive more than $200 billion in duplicate payments [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=345.09999999999997s)]
*  between 2019 and 2021. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=349.5s)]
*  Why does that happen? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=351.5s)]
*  Because there's people doing the same job, answering the same questions, paying out with [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=352.5s)]
*  taxpayer dollars. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=356.29999999999995s)]
*  If it was their money, they would not be doing this. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=357.85999999999996s)]
*  So they want to have all the computers talk to each other. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=361.1s)]
*  And the way I understood it is this. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_V8ftOWGU0&t=363.98s)]
