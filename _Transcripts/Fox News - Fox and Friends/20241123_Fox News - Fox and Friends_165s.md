# ‘DAMAGE CONTROL’: Gavin Newsom ‘did not see this coming,’ Brenberg says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y)
*  And no Democrat in the country has been more open borders than, of course, Gavin Newsom, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  governor of California. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=4.76s)]
*  And he's making sounds like he might be kicking off his presidential campaign for 2020, what [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=6.68s)]
*  is it, 2028. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=14.36s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=15.36s)]
*  Add four. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=16.36s)]
*  I care about people. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=17.36s)]
*  I don't care who you voted for. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=18.36s)]
*  I care about people. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=22.32s)]
*  I care about Trump supporters. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=23.76s)]
*  I care about R.F.K. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=25.64s)]
*  Jr. supporters. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=26.64s)]
*  I care about Tucker Carlson supporters. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=27.64s)]
*  I care about Charlie Kirk supporters. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=29.64s)]
*  I care about Ben Shapiro supporters. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  I care about all people. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=33.4s)]
*  I care about protecting them, their public safety and their public health. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=36.04s)]
*  So after a couple of years of conservatives being fascists and following Hitler, he's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=40.0s)]
*  now going around these red counties and red districts in California and trying to make [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  nice with conservatives. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=52.08s)]
*  Right, because the Democrat Party saw a lot of losses in that central valley of California. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=53.6s)]
*  So listen, I don't know how sincere Gavin Newsom is. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=58.98s)]
*  He doesn't strike me as the most sincere guy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=61.98s)]
*  I can assure you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=63.78s)]
*  But I can say that he's doing better in the post-Trump election environment than say, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=65.98s)]
*  Kathy Hochul, who's digging her heels in. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=73.38s)]
*  And so that is somebody who at least is saying the right stuff, whether he actually means [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=75.7s)]
*  it or doesn't. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=82.42s)]
*  But at least he recognizes what just happened in November. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=84.02s)]
*  Well, I think he's shocked. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=88.7s)]
*  I just think he's shocked that his state moved so red in this last election. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=90.58s)]
*  I don't think he saw that coming. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=97.86s)]
*  And so that's why he's out touring saying, I've got to do some damage control here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  And I agree it's in response to Trump winning. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=104.66s)]
*  And in response to the fact that he wants to be the next president. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=107.25999999999999s)]
*  He wants to be the next president and he sees an open lane there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  But he's also kind of saying at the same time, we're going to Trump-proof California, you [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=112.94s)]
*  know, when it comes to the environment, when it comes to the border. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=116.74s)]
*  So, you know, which of those two messages is going to win out? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=119.74s)]
*  I don't think it's the I care about people message that's probably going to win out. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=122.46s)]
*  I think it's what he actually does, which, by the way, is why people in California said [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=126.46s)]
*  we don't like what's happened. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=130.74s)]
*  We don't like what you do. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=131.98s)]
*  We want to see something else. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=133.02s)]
*  And it is interesting to compare Hochul to Newsom because, of course, both New York and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=134.18s)]
*  California moved a full 12 points towards Trump between 2020 and 2024. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=138.9s)]
*  And so you are seeing two opposite reactions. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=145.22s)]
*  And I guess you should give him credit. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=148.7s)]
*  But but I can I can assure you he means none of it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=150.62s)]
*  Well, I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=154.02s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade and I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlRoMB1E6Y&t=155.57999999999998s)]
