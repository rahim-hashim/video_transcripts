# Harris faces criticism over resurfaced 2019 remark
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg)
*  So after the Brazilian Supreme Court upheld the country's ban on Elon Musk X, many are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=0.0s)]
*  wondering if something like that could happen here in the U.S. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=8.38s)]
*  Well, it wasn't long ago. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump was banned from the platform, and Kamala Harris vocally supported [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=12.52s)]
*  the watch. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=17.76s)]
*  We're talking about a private corporation, Twitter, that has terms of use. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=18.76s)]
*  And as far as I'm concerned, and I think most people would say, including members of Congress [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=24.16s)]
*  who he has threatened, that he has lost his privileges and it should be taken down. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=28.38s)]
*  There has to be a responsibility that is placed on these social media sites to understand [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=34.06s)]
*  their power. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=40.1s)]
*  OK, so George Washington University law professor, Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley is here [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=41.1s)]
*  to react. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=46.18s)]
*  So Professor, you know, I wouldn't put much stock into this if it weren't for politicians [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=47.64s)]
*  now wanting the policies of some of the leaders in Latin America. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=54.1s)]
*  No, I think that's right, although we have to take this far more seriously than that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  You know, in my new book, The Indispensable Right, I talk about this anti-free speech [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=65.98s)]
*  movement that's been growing around the world. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=70.76s)]
*  That wave is now reaching our shores. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  And they have largely been unsuccessful in convincing people to give up freedom, right? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=76.34s)]
*  This is a hard sell. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=81.8s)]
*  You got to get free people to give up some freedom. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=82.8s)]
*  And it hasn't worked. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  Facebook even did a commercial campaign to get young people to embrace censorship. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  So this is plan B. You know, you have in Europe threats against Musk for arrest. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=92.92s)]
*  They've already arrested another CEO of a platform. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=98.56s)]
*  But it's really Brazil that I think many in the anti-free speech movement are watching [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=102.64s)]
*  carefully. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=107.6s)]
*  If Brazil can succeed in banning Twitter from the entire country, it will be replicated, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=109.04s)]
*  because many hold the view of what you just heard from Vice President Harris. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  They view speech as a privilege. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=121.16000000000001s)]
*  It's like a driver's license that they think that can be rescinded if you're reckless. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=122.84s)]
*  And this is the ultimate destination for this movement, where if they can convince people [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=128.68s)]
*  to give up their own freedoms to embrace censorship, they're going to start to take [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=135.3s)]
*  sites offline to prevent people from hearing opposing views. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=139.38000000000002s)]
*  You know, Professor, I'm just curious, what's the solution for this? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  I mean, we already have a constitutional amendment. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=147.62s)]
*  You don't think you need more than that when it comes to an issue like this, but it seems [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  like we may. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=155.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good question, Lawrence. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=156.06s)]
*  And by the way, there's a movement to amend the First Amendment. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, my colleague is leading that, who says that the First Amendment is aggressively individualistic, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=162.38s)]
*  which is sort of the point. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=167.7s)]
*  But no, we need more protection through Congress. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=170.38s)]
*  And this should be the issue of this election. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  In 1800, Thomas Jefferson defeated John Adams in the only presidential election where free [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=176.94s)]
*  speech was the central issue. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=183.2s)]
*  Free speech is on the ballot, not democracy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=185.9s)]
*  Free speech is on the ballot. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=188.64s)]
*  Because quite frankly, Harris-Waltz administration would be a perfect nightmare for free speech. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=190.48s)]
*  Well, Professor, I wish I had more time to talk about this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  I do think it's a big issue facing the country. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  Brian has forced me to toss it to him for headlines. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=202.28s)]
*  Now, against your will, you can't press charges even though you have retained Jonathan Turley. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=205.92s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=211.44s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=212.6s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvNpKw8Gtg&t=213.6s)]
