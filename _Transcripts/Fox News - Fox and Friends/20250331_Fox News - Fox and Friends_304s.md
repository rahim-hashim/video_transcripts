# Musk heads to CIA for government efficiency talks
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU)
*  So here we go. Elon Musk is heading to the CIA today to meet with Director John Radcliffe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=0.0s)]
*  about his government efficiency program. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=6.44s)]
*  And Madeline Rivera joins us from Washington with all the details. Good morning to you, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Maddie. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=12.96s)]
*  Hi, guys. Good morning. CIA Director John Radcliffe said at a threats assessment hearing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=13.96s)]
*  on Capitol Hill last week that Doge has not been on the CIA campus. That appears to be [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=17.64s)]
*  changing. A CIA spokesperson tells Politico Musk is heading to the agency today at Radcliffe's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=23.32s)]
*  invitation. This would seem to be Radcliffe's most substantial meeting yet with Musk, as [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=28.84s)]
*  the director previously said. His interactions with Musk have been limited to Cabinet meetings. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=33.92s)]
*  The point of today's conversation is reportedly to talk about government efficiency. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=39.88s)]
*  National security agencies were exempt from that federal buyout employee program that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=45.0s)]
*  President Trump unveiled in January, but the CIA, under Radcliffe's direction, offer the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=49.6s)]
*  buyouts to its workforce anyway to align with President Trump's priorities. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=54.68s)]
*  Musk is pushing ahead with his efforts to cut costs as people around the country continue [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=59.92s)]
*  their protests against him. There were several Tesla takedown demonstrations across the U.S. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=64.88s)]
*  and Europe over the weekend. This comes as vandalism and attacks targeting Tesla property [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=70.72s)]
*  grow. Authorities say they'll be ramping up their actions against these incidents. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=75.44s)]
*  Musk, though, is pushing for law enforcement to go further, saying it is time to arrest [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=81.56s)]
*  those funding the attacks. Arresting their puppets and paid foot soldiers won't stop [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=86.04s)]
*  the violence, he says. The FBI has a task force aimed at cracking down on these attacks, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  which Attorney General Pan Bondi labeled as domestic terrorism. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=96.68s)]
*  Lawrence Ainsley and Brian. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=101.08s)]
*  All right. Thanks so much. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=102.08s)]
*  Thank you so much, Maddie. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=103.08s)]
*  It was happening right here in New York City. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=104.08s)]
*  Yeah. Happening in Canada and in Europe as well. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=105.68s)]
*  I like this meeting that's happened amongst Director Radcliffe, who used to be over all [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  of intelligence in the past administration. He also used to be a U.S. congressman and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=114.28s)]
*  U.S. attorney. When you're talking about intelligence, you know, there's so many funds that you [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  don't want our enemies tracking because we have assets all over the world. But there [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=123.0s)]
*  is a safety part of this conversation I think is necessary. Right now, the best app on the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=128.12s)]
*  market right now, and I want to re litigate this because we talked about it last night, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=135.04s)]
*  is Signal. That's why they're using Signal, our assets. If Elon Musk can help our director [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=138.72s)]
*  create something internally that is more secure, I think it would be great for our intelligence [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=143.68s)]
*  officials. Hopefully they get to the bottom of today's meeting. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. He was also in Wisconsin over the weekend because there's that big Supreme Court election [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=152.56s)]
*  because there's a liberal running against a conservative and they will be hearing a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=157.76s)]
*  lot of different court cases that are crucial to our country. So there's a very important [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=162.52s)]
*  election tomorrow. It's on Fox Nation right now, but if you want to know exactly what [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=166.68s)]
*  Elon Musk is going to be doing there, he's going to the Pentagon too, these guys got [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  about what, 130 days, six months to do it. What they are doing with Doge, might go down [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=173.68s)]
*  is one of the most successful operations ever, despite what you've been hearing. And a lot [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=180.36s)]
*  of this because they haven't been communicating effectively what they're doing, but getting [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=184.08s)]
*  to talk to each other, having invoices, people explain what an invoice is before they're [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=188.4s)]
*  being paid, is going to save us billions of dollars. It's going to get very close to a [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  trillion. And as he said in Wisconsin last night, if we can cut a trillion and we could [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=198.44s)]
*  make it through efficiency, we could actually, we can cut a trillion out of spending and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=203.4s)]
*  then cut a trillion using efficiency. We get very close to getting an equal, even budget [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=211.34s)]
*  and then start working on the deficit. You have all these people talking about, we have [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=216.2s)]
*  four payroll processors, 259 departments. They estimate 500 billion in fraud. If we [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=220.16s)]
*  could just get computers to talk to each other, and the example best given is a nine month [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=226.28s)]
*  old gets a small business loan. How do they do it? It's through fraud. Well, how could [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=231.72s)]
*  you stop it? If Social Security was able to talk to small business, as soon as you typed [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=235.6s)]
*  it in, it would come up that that person with the ID that was stolen is a nine month old. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=240.04s)]
*  So when you have Medicare payments, well, we're not cutting Medicare. He's saying, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=244.94s)]
*  look, you can't get Medicare payments in New York and Connecticut. Well, how are you getting [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=249.06s)]
*  that now? New York doesn't talk to Connecticut. So can we get the computers to talk to each [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=252.62s)]
*  other? Is anyone offended? Is that a Republican idea or a Democrat idea? No. Our computer [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=256.66s)]
*  system is 50 years old. By just doing these efficiency things, using technology quickly, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=261.54s)]
*  we can immediately, even Social Security, they talk about that big vault where all of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=267.54s)]
*  our stuff is. Twenty two million documents are there. He thinks they can document all [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=271.42s)]
*  this stuff and put it computerized in about three, four, three more weeks. You do that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=276.1s)]
*  automatically when you have a chance to retire or you're 120 years old. You don't get payments. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  You're under 62. You get payments. This will be a way to wipe things out without hurting [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  payments. If he could do that, this would be great for our country. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=290.86s)]
*  and most compelling analysis. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aBFJMqnjpU&t=301.42s)]
