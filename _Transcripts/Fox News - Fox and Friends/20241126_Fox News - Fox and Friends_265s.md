# Peter Doocy on Harris staffers' fury as campaign faces massive debts
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM)
*  All right, today, former VP nominee Tim Walz is set to finally address [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=0.0s)]
*  Democratic donors amid reports that the Harris campaign spent themselves into [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=4.28s)]
*  debt, leaving staffers high and dry. Meanwhile, Trump's new super team is [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=8.48s)]
*  assembling and falling more into form by the day. Senior White House [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=13.44s)]
*  correspondent Peter Ducey joins us live from the White House. Hey, Peter. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=17.02s)]
*  Good morning. The Harris campaign remains in debt after the Harris walls [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=21.5s)]
*  ticket failed in November. And now Tim Walz is going to hit up wealthy [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=26.12s)]
*  Democratic donors to ask for some money to help repaying all of the vendors [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=30.6s)]
*  that they still owe and staff members that they stopped paying months before [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=35.52s)]
*  they were supposed to. We don't know yet because we haven't seen excerpts [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=40.6s)]
*  whether or not he plans to take accountability for what happened in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  November or if he plans to share his own road map for the next few years. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=47.56s)]
*  And as Tim Walz addresses the party's elite rank and file DNC staff are going [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=51.199999999999996s)]
*  grassroots with a go fund me after saying they were blindsided by being [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=56.8s)]
*  fired suddenly with no severance. They're about $16,000 towards a $25,000 [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=61.12s)]
*  goal. The organizer of this DNC Union Go Fund Me says we are heartbroken to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=67.44s)]
*  see our colleagues who dedicated countless hours to electing Democrats [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=73.32s)]
*  up and down the ballot depart under these circumstances. And we are furious [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=76.88s)]
*  with DNC leadership for failing to provide severance to those affected as [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=81.44s)]
*  they fundraise. The Trump team is filling out their cabinet. The president [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  elect is reportedly trying to place cash Patel in a high ranking DOJ or FBI [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=89.92s)]
*  job. And Elon Musk, who is hiring right now with Vivek Ramaswamy for the Doge [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=96.28s)]
*  government waste project, is said to be on the lookout for an AI czar. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=100.96s)]
*  Back to you, Peter got a quick question for you. Given the fact that the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=106.88s)]
*  Democrats had an epic loss in the race for that building behind you, the DNC [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  Union people didn't see layoffs coming where they were going to get one day's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=116.6s)]
*  notice. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=122.8s)]
*  Doesn't sound like it. No. And they are about $16,000 of a $25,000 goal. It [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=124.44s)]
*  doesn't seem like there that people who donated a lot of money for months, even [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=131.0s)]
*  just $10, $15 at a time on those recurring payments that you get the text [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=136.84s)]
*  messages about constantly in an election season. It doesn't seem like there's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  much of an appetite for people to open their wallets again for that or for the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=144.28s)]
*  Harris campaign that now needs Tim Walls to go out and ask for help. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=150.52s)]
*  You know how many people were fired? I know it was two thirds. Do we know the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=154.68s)]
*  exact number? Because I feel like $25,000 to help people pay their rents [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=157.6s)]
*  and their bills is not that much if it's hundreds of people. You've got to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=161.36s)]
*  split it. They're saying that the $25,000 is temporary because they still [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=164.56s)]
*  think they're going to be able to get some kind of money out of the DNC or [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=168.2s)]
*  some kind of unemployment assistance. And so it's temporary. They had a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=172.88s)]
*  protest at Union Station yesterday. It was pretty small. Peter, why'd you wear [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  that necktie today? Did you see me do the tease at 555? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=181.88s)]
*  This is the necktie that Gentle Ben used to wear. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=188.52s)]
*  Can we kill the audio until we toss two of that in? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=194.56s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=198.56s)]
*  The bear never wore a tie. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=200.56s)]
*  This is true. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=202.56s)]
*  On TV. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=204.56s)]
*  Back to this GoFundMe. I think the GoFundMe is a PR move to show how dire things are there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=206.56s)]
*  Because the $25,000 is not going to do much, but it does make them look bad and it does shame the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=213.56s)]
*  party officials to do something for the union. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=221.56s)]
*  You could exactly be right. It's like, okay, if you guys don't help us, we're going to go public with this. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=225.56s)]
*  Well, it hit the fan. They went public with it. But it does speak to the larger issue. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=231.56s)]
*  Why do you belong to a union if the union is not going to protect you when your boss fires you? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=235.56s)]
*  You know, I don't know about their health care situation in that particular union, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=242.56s)]
*  but it doesn't sound like there's any severance that they are automatically entitled to. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=246.56s)]
*  They are going to fight for it, however. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=250.56s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SJi6ojussM&t=252.56s)]
