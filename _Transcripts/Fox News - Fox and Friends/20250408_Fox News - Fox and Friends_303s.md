# Peter Doocy: Trump is DUG IN
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE)
*  All right, let's talk about your money and trade and the trade battle between the United States and China is ramping up with Beijing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=0.0s)]
*  promising to quote fight to the end whatever that means [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=8.0s)]
*  Meanwhile dozens of other countries have already reached out to the Trump administration to begin the trade negotiations as the president orders talks now [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=12.18s)]
*  With Japan well, which is good news the market seemed to like that Peter Ducey joins us from the White House Peter [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=19.64s)]
*  Yes about a third of all countries on the planet that are dealing with at a minimum this new 10% baseline [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=25.0s)]
*  Tariff are calling folks in the West Wing here asking for the way down [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=31.6s)]
*  That there are [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=38.68s)]
*  5060 maybe almost 70 countries now who have approached us [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=40.2s)]
*  So it's it's gonna be a busy April May maybe into June [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=44.96s)]
*  President Trump is gonna be personally involved in these negotiations and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=49.72s)]
*  He believes as many of us do that there's been an unfair playing field. So the negotiations are gonna be tough [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=54.24s)]
*  Well, nobody tougher than China where officials are warning today [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=61.64s)]
*  The US threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the US [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=65.14s)]
*  China will never accept this if the US insists on its own way [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=73.92s)]
*  China will fight to the end and this is what Beijing is worried about [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=77.6s)]
*  So there's the possible tariff announced Monday 50% you add that to the reciprocal tariff announced last week 34% [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=81.12s)]
*  Add that to the tariff over fentanyl trafficking that was announced in February. That's 20% you get to a hundred and four percent [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=88.0s)]
*  Tariff on Chinese goods that says the Israelis came here yesterday to show that Trump is willing to work with [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=95.68s)]
*  friendlies on trade this way [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=102.44s)]
*  We will eliminate the trade deficit with the United States [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=106.4s)]
*  We intend to do it very quickly. We think it's the right thing to do and we're going to also eliminate [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=110.56s)]
*  Trade barriers a variety of trade barriers that have been put up unnecessarily [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=117.64s)]
*  And I think Israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  And so Israel came all the way to the White House [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=128.28s)]
*  BB-9 now came all the way to the White House yesterday [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=132.12s)]
*  To talk about being a model for other countries not to announce some kind of a grand bargain [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=134.32s)]
*  President Trump is still dug in on these Liberation Day tariffs and we expect to hear a [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=139.04s)]
*  Full defense of that from the trade representative Jameson Greer testifying before the Senate Finance Committee at 10 a.m [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=145.4s)]
*  Today, so stay tuned for that. So Peter did Netanyahu leave without a deal [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=152.16s)]
*  Did he have a verbal agreement a handshake agreement? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=156.88s)]
*  Do you sense a he they came to agree some type of I guess [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  Some type of big beautiful deal. Yeah, I mean is there anything done [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=166.52s)]
*  It seems like it's more of a gentleman's agreement as soon as there is something that they can put out that would show other countries [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=170.36s)]
*  In fact, this is the model. This is the way we will take the tariffs down [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  We would expect to hear about that right away because President Trump has been telling us stuff with very little delay for the last three months [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=181.76s)]
*  Basically right away [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=188.48s)]
*  But that is not what happened yesterday some kind of a gentleman's agreement [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=191.04s)]
*  You know hold on a little bit longer [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=194.64s)]
*  friend [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=197.0s)]
*  And we'll see you next time [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=198.2s)]
*  Yeah, so Peter part of the one of the reasons the market has been selling off like crazy [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=199.68s)]
*  Although today it looks like it's we're gonna have a good day to start [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  Is the president's men and women have not all been on the same page some are talking about permanent tariffs [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=208.8s)]
*  Which means forever as long as this administration has a say to it or [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=215.36s)]
*  It's just a starting point for a negotiation and we just heard in that sound bite you played with these Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=220.56s)]
*  He was talking about, you know, it could be a very busy April and May so it sounds like that's the runway [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  They're given the president tell or at least the president's targeting a tell June to get it all [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=234.60000000000002s)]
*  You know everybody whipped into order [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=241.28s)]
*  Yes, and if you look at what President Trump has been saying there won't be a need for these reciprocal tariffs if more stuff [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  More valuable stuff is being produced in the United States. And so once there are commitments to start doing that from big companies [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=250.88s)]
*  We would expect that to be part of the part of the deal to get the tariffs down or gone. All right [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=259.64s)]
*  All right. Well Peter we added a new word to our vocabulary [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=266.16s)]
*  Panikin he said don't be weak. Don't be stupid. Don't be a Panikin, which is a new party based on weak and stupid people [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=269.64s)]
*  He says to be strong courageous and be patient you take panic and then you add an a panikin [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=276.12s)]
*  And Peter never panic ins so that's Peter Panikin. Yep only pelicans panic in that's we're here and don't bring up penguins [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=282.24s)]
*  All right. Thanks so much Peter. I'm Steve juicy [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ust75gBjJgE&t=290.56s)]
