# This is fantastic news for Donald Trump: Kerri Urbahn
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM)
*  Will you accept the jury's outcome, their verdict, no matter what it is? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=4.24s)]
*  And have you ruled out a pardon for your son? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=5.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=7.68s)]
*  I said I'd fight by the jury decision. I will do that and I will not pardon him. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=8.18s)]
*  Huh. Not true. Fox News alert this morning. Fallout. Fallout over President Biden's big reversal [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=13.6s)]
*  as his pardons, as he pardons his son Hunter after Peter Lee claiming he would never pardon [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=19.52s)]
*  his son Hunter. Fox News legal editor Kerry Urbahn joins us now. Kerry, your reaction to something [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=24.16s)]
*  we all knew was coming and the letter that followed to explain. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=29.68s)]
*  Yeah, we knew this was coming. We knew that he wasn't telling the truth. We knew he was [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=34.32s)]
*  going to do it one way or the other. But I have to say, Brian, my takeaway from all of this is [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=37.44s)]
*  that this is actually fantastic, politically speaking, for Donald Trump. Joe Biden has lowered [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  the bar so much here in offering this pardon to Hunter Biden that I think Donald Trump will be [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  able to pardon a whole host of people, including January 6th, without necessarily the pushback he [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=54.16s)]
*  would have received otherwise. Of course, the people in the media will complain because they [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=60.0s)]
*  always do. But what can they point to at this point? So you have that. Maybe he could even [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=64.08s)]
*  explore preemptive pardon for himself. And then, of course, he doesn't just now have a mandate from [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  the American people in cleaning up the justice system who are sick of lawfare. Now he has it [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  from President Biden too. They're all on the same page. So they all agree that there is a problem [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=78.64s)]
*  in the justice system. The pardons are going to become a lot easier. And also, Joe Biden just [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=83.52s)]
*  pulled the ultimate move in overriding the DOJ, which, of course, in the past, people would go [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  crazy if Donald Trump had anything to say about what the Department of Justice was doing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=93.52s)]
*  So I personally think President Biden just made things a whole lot easier for Donald Trump going [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=97.44s)]
*  to term two. I think that's a good point too. And it's the first time I can remember Democrats [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=101.92s)]
*  coming out blatantly against him. You have Governor Jared Polis says, you know, I understand it's his [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=105.52s)]
*  son, but he thought he can't support this action. It's a bad precedent that you could be abused by [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=110.08s)]
*  later presidents. Case in point. And Congressman Greg Stanton, a Democrat from Arizona, I respect [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=115.2s)]
*  Biden, but I think he got this wrong. This wasn't a politically motivated prosecution. Hunter [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=120.4s)]
*  committed felonies and was convicted by a jury of his peers. What I find stunning and must really [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=124.64s)]
*  bother you as somebody who lives in the law world is that he says, I trust the justice system, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=129.76s)]
*  the justice system, but not now, not here. But I still trust it. Also, he lied on something so [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=135.68s)]
*  unfair. I thought over the weekend I decided to make the decision. Why wait? We know you didn't [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=142.88s)]
*  decide over the weekend. So why do these? Why would someone, if you were his attorney, why put [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=148.4s)]
*  all these things that are so easily exploited in a letter to explain something so controversial? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=154.4s)]
*  Because I don't think he cares. He's trying to have it both ways on his way out. What does he [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=159.84s)]
*  have to lose at this point? Nothing. You know, there'll be a 24 hour, 48 hour news cycle on this [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=163.28s)]
*  if that maybe a line in his Wikipedia page. But what kind of ramifications is Joe Biden [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=168.96s)]
*  face for this? Nothing. He really doesn't. And so I think that again, politically, it's good for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=173.36s)]
*  Donald Trump. It's not bad for Joe Biden. And I will say this, Brian, I thought it was interesting [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=179.44s)]
*  in his statement about them treating Hunter differently. I actually agree with him a little [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=186.32s)]
*  bit on that because they did give him special treatment up front. And the only reason we know [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=190.0s)]
*  that they did is because of those whistleblowers. And then when the political pressure was so [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=193.68s)]
*  intense as to what they had done, and then we saw it all fall apart in court, that's when they [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=198.96s)]
*  changed. So they made a deal with Hunter. They never should have made in the first place. So that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=202.8s)]
*  was bad. That's special treatment. But then they pulled the deal, which by the way is also not fair [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=206.64s)]
*  once you've done something like that. So they messed up this entire case. He's not wrong in [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=212.24s)]
*  that he was treated differently. I just have a little bit of a different perspective on how [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=217.04s)]
*  differently he was treated. Right. This is very just real quick on the plea deal. He said they had [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=219.92s)]
*  a carefully negotiated plea deal agreed to by the department, you know, unraveled in the courtroom, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  unraveled in the courtroom because the judge said, I've never seen anything quite like this. Can you [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=230.88s)]
*  explain it? And both sides go, no. So I think we'll start again. Right. But I think he's, I think [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=235.11999999999998s)]
*  that's a point of truth in this statement. I think that Hunter Biden and his lawyers were genuinely [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=241.27999999999997s)]
*  surprised. I think that DOJ had worked out this plea deal of a lifetime was hoping it would go away, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=245.68s)]
*  was giving him the special treatment and then they got caught. They were exposed [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  and then they leaned in really heavily. So that's what happened there. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=254.88s)]
*  Carrie, I know there's so much more we could talk about, but I appreciate you putting their [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=258.56s)]
*  perspective and the one person smiling lives at Mar-a-Lago. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dpGPmT8RM&t=261.2s)]
