# Gen Z voter says Kamala’s campaign is ‘all vibes, no policy’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY)
*  From TikToks to podcasts to inviting influencers to the conventions, both the Harris and Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=0.0s)]
*  campaign are getting creative to reach the more than 41 million Gen Z voters that are [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=7.96s)]
*  eligible to cast a ballot this year. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=14.3s)]
*  Everybody, Tim here with Scout at the dog park along the Mississippi doing our first [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=17.0s)]
*  entry into TikTok or as he and I say, Tim Talk. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  JD, you want to welcome you to TikTok? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=26.44s)]
*  Some gifts? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Thanks, man. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=29.400000000000002s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  Madam Vice President, are you on TikTok? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, I've heard that recently I've been on the For You page, so I thought I'd get [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=33.4s)]
*  on here myself. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=37.92s)]
*  The president is now on TikTok. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=38.92s)]
*  It's my honor. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=41.92s)]
*  By the way, that Trump video showing his entrance into TikTok got 174 million views. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=44.84s)]
*  What's really important to the youth vote joining me now, three Gen Z voters, former [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=56.08s)]
*  Democrat turned Republican Grace Gunsell, independent voter and former RFK Junior campaign [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=61.16s)]
*  adviser and TikTok influencer, Link Lauren and Democrat Henry Huschke. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=67.32s)]
*  Welcome to all three of you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=73.96s)]
*  I'm so fascinated to have you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=74.96s)]
*  I want you to take a look at this poll. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=76.08s)]
*  This is a Fox News poll. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=78.64s)]
*  It's registered voters under the age of 35. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=80.24s)]
*  This was before RFK got out of the poll. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=83.8s)]
*  So 46% for Harris, 41 for Trump, 5% for RFK, 3% for West. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=86.44s)]
*  So I'm going to go to you, Grace, because, Grace, you were Democrat. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=92.72s)]
*  You're starting to lean. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=96.92s)]
*  You were starting to lean Republican, but you were debating with RFK Junior. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=97.92s)]
*  So now how does this new endorsement by RFK Junior, him dropping out of the race and endorsing [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=104.2s)]
*  Trump, impact your vote? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=109.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=112.76s)]
*  So I think for me, originally it was a toss up between RFK Junior and Trump. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=113.76s)]
*  But after RFK Junior dropped out, I think I'm ultimately going to have to vote for Trump [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=123.0s)]
*  just because the disaster that has been wrecked by this current administration and the fact [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=130.88s)]
*  that there are no policies currently listed on Kamala's website or that she has even really [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=137.48s)]
*  talked about has kind of shown to me that it really is for them all vibes, no policy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, that's an interesting take. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=154.67999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to go to you, Henry. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=155.67999999999998s)]
*  You're a Democrat. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  That's been sort of the beef with the Kamala campaign, at least from the pundits. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=157.92s)]
*  But I'm hearing it from another Gen Z-er. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  Tell me what you think about that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=164.28s)]
*  Is it all vibes? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=165.6s)]
*  There is nothing on our website with policy, and it's very social media heavy and TikTok [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=166.72s)]
*  heavy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  And what do you say? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think I would respectfully disagree with Grace and say that the Harris campaign [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  has put out some really excellent policies, actually, for my generation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=182.56s)]
*  One that I think you can point to is her housing policy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=186.76s)]
*  She wants to cut red tape and build three million new homes, as well as give us first-time [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=189.2s)]
*  home buyers a twenty five thousand dollar bonus for down payments. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=195.24s)]
*  So this alone is just a huge policy for my generation, getting us on the housing ladder [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=200.56s)]
*  and helping us achieve the dream of American homeownership. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=205.4s)]
*  Yeah, you know, that's that alone is one huge policy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=207.84s)]
*  You know, it's been really interesting to me. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  I have children who are in part of your generation and housing has become this huge issue. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=212.68s)]
*  Who knew? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=219.32000000000002s)]
*  Because if you remember, they were saying, you know, you'll rent and you'll be happy. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  But it turns out young people actually do want to own their own home. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  Link, talk about that policy. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  And also, since you're an influencer, how much of social media emphasis these candidates [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  should have? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=237.0s)]
*  How much is that going to actually help them versus the substance as we've been talking [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=238.0s)]
*  about? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=241.16000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  Well, first off, it's great to be with you bright and early this morning. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=243.16000000000003s)]
*  The one thing I can say about young voters is we are not monolithic. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=246.4s)]
*  But when you look at every single poll, the top concern for young Americans right now [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=250.64s)]
*  is how can I afford a home? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=255.23999999999998s)]
*  How can I keep a roof over my head, have equity in an asset like that, in the way that my [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=257.88s)]
*  parents did and the way that my grandparents did? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=261.88s)]
*  So for any politician out there looking to bring young people into their coalition, it [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=264.6s)]
*  is not rocket science. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=268.88s)]
*  Identify their top concerns and then use social media, use influencers to reach them and show [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=270.84s)]
*  how you're going to enrich their lives with policies. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=275.78s)]
*  The one thing I haven't seen from Kamala Harris yet is how is she going to get any of this [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=278.68s)]
*  past? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=282.64s)]
*  She's promising 25,000 to first-time homeowners. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=283.64s)]
*  She has no path to getting this past. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=286.36s)]
*  And Kamala Harris, it's about 40 days without an interview. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=288.2s)]
*  She won't answer questions. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=291.26s)]
*  If you're not willing to sit down and answer questions from voters, you really shouldn't [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=292.52s)]
*  be in charge of the nuclear codes. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=295.88s)]
*  Can I? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=297.44s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=298.44s)]
*  Go ahead, Henry. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=299.44s)]
*  Oh, I just I would put the challenge back to President, former President Trump and what [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=300.44s)]
*  how he's going to get anything that he wants passed. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=306.76000000000005s)]
*  The only policy that I've seen from him is a plan to personally dictate interest rates, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=309.68s)]
*  which is something that has never happened in the history of this country and would greatly [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  destabilize our financial system that we've had. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  The Independent Federal Reserve has been a cornerstone of keeping our economy stable. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=321.92s)]
*  So I don't really see what's coming from the Trump side on this either. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=328.76000000000005s)]
*  So I want to ask you guys about this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=329.76000000000005s)]
*  I was really surprised to hear at the DNC, for example, they winded down the influencers. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  They had boat parties, rooftop lounges. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  They had they stocked their private rooms with food and beverages. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  They had access to the candidates. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  Both parties are trying to do the social media route. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=344.8s)]
*  How important is that grace that they actually get in this game? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, Kamala is obviously doing better than Donald Trump in terms of followers. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  But tell me your thoughts on that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=358.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think social media is incredibly important just because the young voters are spending [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=362.16s)]
*  so much time on social media nowadays. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=368.12s)]
*  But I think a lot of times the politicians underestimate social media as it can be a [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=371.08s)]
*  great tool to inform and spread policy and really show us what you want to do in the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  next four years instead of just using memes and templates just to like get your name [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=385.12s)]
*  out there. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=391.16s)]
*  I think, you know, a lot more could be done with social media. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=392.16s)]
*  Really quick links and you're an influencer. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=395.56s)]
*  I got to get your thoughts on this. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=397.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's nothing that's ever going to beat retail politics. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=398.92s)]
*  But if you're trying to reach these young people, you got to go to social media. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=403.04s)]
*  Only nine percent of Gen Z watch traditional TV news on a daily basis. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=406.24s)]
*  They're not going to see these new shows. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=410.16s)]
*  You got to get them on TikTok, X and Instagram. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=411.8s)]
*  But you got to have content that answers their questions and top concerns. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  Less vibes, less coconut memes, more policies and more substance. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhTQ0bm3rnY&t=418.88s)]
