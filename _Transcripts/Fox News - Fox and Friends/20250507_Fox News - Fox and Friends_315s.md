# India strikes Pakistan after terror attack, raising fears of nuclear exchange
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w)
*  Fox News alert India launching military strikes into Pakistan after more than two dozen civilians [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=0.0s)]
*  were killed in a terror attack in Indian administrative administered area of Kashmir last month. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=6.9s)]
*  President Trump responding to the move. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=12.9s)]
*  It's a shame we just heard about it just as we were walking in the doors of the oval. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  Just heard about it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  They've been fighting for a long time. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=26.66s)]
*  You know, they've been fighting for many, many decades and centuries actually, if you [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=28.06s)]
*  really think about it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=34.06s)]
*  No, I just hope it ends very quickly. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=35.42s)]
*  We know this terror activity there. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=40.18s)]
*  We're no strangers to that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=42.38s)]
*  Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying, quote, India acts of aggression has resulted [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=44.22s)]
*  in a martyrdom of civilians, including women and children. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=47.94s)]
*  India's reckless action has brought two nuclear armed states closer to major conflict. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=50.94s)]
*  Pakistan reserves the right to respond appropriately at a time and place of its choosing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=55.74s)]
*  Hillary Act former Secretary of State Fox News contributor Mike Pompeo and Mr. Secretary, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=59.74s)]
*  I'd also add that they said they shot down two Indian planes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=64.3s)]
*  We've been unable to confirm that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=67.66s)]
*  Your thoughts about this long time friction. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=69.26s)]
*  Brian, good morning. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=72.94s)]
*  Yeah, this long time friction since the division was created back in 1947, there's no doubt [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=75.74000000000001s)]
*  about that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  They've been at this across this so-called line of control in the north of India where [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=81.74000000000001s)]
*  the border between India and Pakistan exists and Jammu and Kashmir. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=85.22s)]
*  I dealt with this in 2019. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=89.1s)]
*  We had a very similar situation. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=91.02s)]
*  Both countries thought the other was moving towards rolling out their nuclear weapons. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=93.3s)]
*  We were able to use really good diplomacy, American military influence to shape it and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=97.5s)]
*  deescalate. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=102.1s)]
*  I hope the Trump administration and frankly others in the region, India needs support [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=103.1s)]
*  from China, so does Pakistan. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=108.5s)]
*  There are others in the region who have the ability to shape and influence this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=109.98s)]
*  We do not need escalation in this fighting with two nuclear armed nations. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=112.54s)]
*  Do you think we should get involved right away? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, get involved. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=121.78s)]
*  We should be talking to both sides, making clear to them that it is unacceptable to continue [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  this. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=128.82s)]
*  We should help them identify what happened. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=129.82s)]
*  There were terror attacks into India. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=131.1s)]
*  No nation's going to allow that to happen in their own country without a response. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=132.94s)]
*  We wouldn't let that happen here, so that's appropriate, but we need to let cooler heads [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=136.82s)]
*  prevail and we have the diplomatic capacity and the capacity to shape how they're thinking [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=141.73999999999998s)]
*  about this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=146.5s)]
*  Do I think encourage them to keep a lid on this thing? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=147.5s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about the news. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=150.05999999999997s)]
*  It was pretty surprising when President Trump said this about the Houthi rebels who we've [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=151.73999999999998s)]
*  been bombing now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=156.33999999999997s)]
*  We have 500 separate bombing runs, excuse me, 800 strikes at targets amongst the Houthi [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=158.14s)]
*  rebels in Yemen. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=166.61999999999998s)]
*  Listen to what the president said yesterday. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=168.01999999999998s)]
*  The Houthis have announced that they are not, or they've announced to us at least, that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=170.94s)]
*  they don't want to fight anymore. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=175.34s)]
*  They just don't want to fight and we will honor that and we will stop the bombings. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=177.46s)]
*  They say they will not be blowing up ships anymore and that's what the purpose of what [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=186.94s)]
*  we were doing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=191.74s)]
*  He said Steve Witkoff worked out this ceasefire over the weekend in Oman. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=192.74s)]
*  Are you to believe it? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=198.9s)]
*  Who wants to be the first merchant ship through the waterway? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=199.9s)]
*  Distrust but verify, Brian. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=205.70000000000002s)]
*  We've seen this movie before. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=207.82s)]
*  I hope it's true. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=209.58s)]
*  I hope it lasts. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=210.58s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=211.58s)]
*  Who wants to be the first merchant vessel? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=212.58s)]
*  We'll see what happens to insurance rates as ships decide I'm going to take a run through [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=214.34s)]
*  this thing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=218.46s)]
*  But look, President Trump got this file right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=219.9s)]
*  He came in, he undid President Biden's silly policy with respect to Iran, he designated [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=221.82s)]
*  and it began to exert real power against not only the Houthis in Yemen but against the Iranian [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=227.46s)]
*  regime itself. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  So it doesn't surprise me that the Houthis are at least for the moment backing down, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=233.98000000000002s)]
*  slowing down, being less aggressive. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=238.18s)]
*  That's important. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=240.58s)]
*  We have US service members in the region that are at risk. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=241.58s)]
*  I hope the Houthis are serious about this and I hope Houthi leadership gets the joke. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=245.06s)]
*  This is not a nation that you want to travel with, the United States of America under President [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=249.5s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=253.54000000000002s)]
*  So quick, do you think this is related to talks with Iran? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  Because we said every time the Houthi rebels go after one of our vessels, we consider that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=257.42s)]
*  an attack from Iran. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=262.26s)]
*  Do you think it's related to the talks that were on pause last week? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=263.26s)]
*  Oh, Brent, undoubtedly there's a connection, right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=267.42s)]
*  This all emanates from Tehran. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=271.3s)]
*  You and I have been talking about this for goodness sake a decade now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=272.84s)]
*  It's, by the way, it's related to what's going on in Gaza with Hamas, but the Houthis are [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=275.7s)]
*  basically an Iranian proxy force funded solely by the, excuse me, the Houthis are funded [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=280.42s)]
*  solely by Iran. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=285.26s)]
*  So yes, I think these are deeply connected. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=286.26s)]
*  I think the pressure on Iran is real. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=287.90000000000003s)]
*  So perhaps there is real progress at reducing instability in the region. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=290.06s)]
*  That'd be a great thing. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  Former, he ran the CIA, he ran the State Department, and now he's a professor at Columbia who I [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=294.78000000000003s)]
*  think should keep his job. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=300.06s)]
*  Mike Pfopow, thanks so much. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=302.34000000000003s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=303.58000000000004s)]
*  We'll catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_cRZebvZ6w&t=310.42s)]
