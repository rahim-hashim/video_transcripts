# Trump surprised as Elon Musk reveals moment he decided to back him
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps)
*  In other news, we were all up late last night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=0.0s)]
*  You might have been, too, watching Sean Hannity's [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=1.92s)]
*  exclusive interview with Elon and with President Trump. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=3.92s)]
*  You know that they're working on Doge together, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=7.96s)]
*  saving us a lot of money. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=9.6s)]
*  They're saying, what, $55 trillion? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=10.64s)]
*  Billion. Billion. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=13.16s)]
*  That's what they say. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  $55 billion they have saved so far, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=14.96s)]
*  and that's just been in the first month. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=17.36s)]
*  Here's a portion of that interview. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=19.0s)]
*  I think the way you think of me is, like, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=22.48s)]
*  I'm a technologist, and I try to make technologies [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=24.04s)]
*  that improve the world and make life better. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=26.72s)]
*  You sure? Yeah. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=29.12s)]
*  And that's why I like my T-shirt says tech support, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  because I'm here to provide the president [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=32.08s)]
*  with technology support. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=34.2s)]
*  Now, that may seem like, well, is that a silly thing? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=36.92s)]
*  But actually, it's a very important thing, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=39.96s)]
*  because the president will make these executive orders, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  which are very sensible and good for the country, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=44.96s)]
*  but then they don't get implemented. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  One of the biggest functions of the Doge team [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=49.56s)]
*  is just making sure that the presidential executive orders [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  are actually carried out. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=54.24s)]
*  And this is, I just want to point out, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=55.84s)]
*  this is a very important thing, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=57.64s)]
*  because the president is the elected representative [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=58.88s)]
*  of the people, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=62.88s)]
*  so it's representing the will of the people. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=64.28s)]
*  And if the bureaucracy is fighting the will of the people [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=66.72s)]
*  and preventing the president from implementing [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=69.76s)]
*  what the people want, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=73.2s)]
*  then what we live in is a bureaucracy and not a democracy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=74.64s)]
*  You write a beautiful executive, and you sign it, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=78.44s)]
*  and you assume it's going to be done, but it's not. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=81.68s)]
*  What he does is he takes it, and with his hundred geniuses, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=83.68s)]
*  he's got some very brilliant young people working for him [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=86.68s)]
*  that dress much worse than him, actually. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=90.16s)]
*  They dress in just T-shirts. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=92.36s)]
*  You wouldn't know they have 180. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=94.28s)]
*  So he's your tech support. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=96.36s)]
*  I literally am tech support, though. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=98.6s)]
*  But he gets it done. He's a leader. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=102.6s)]
*  He is a leader, and you know, his companies have been leaders [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=105.0s)]
*  in software development as well, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=107.64s)]
*  and one of the things that President Trump signed yesterday [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=110.0s)]
*  was about the Software Modernization Initiative, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=113.48s)]
*  and that is something this federal government [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=116.72s)]
*  has needed for a while. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=118.52s)]
*  I mean, how many times have you heard in the last week or two [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=119.48s)]
*  when Elon Musk has talked about, you know, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=122.64s)]
*  there are a bunch of, according to the Social Security Database, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=124.32s)]
*  there are a bunch of 150-year-old people [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=126.96s)]
*  who would be eligible for Social Security. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=129.0s)]
*  It's simply because the way the federal government [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  technology is set up, it's antiquated, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=134.28s)]
*  and it's time to get to 2025 rather than using systems [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=136.68s)]
*  that date back into the 80s. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=140.72s)]
*  Yeah, so they're both talking about the roles they're going to play, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=143.0s)]
*  and what he's doing, too, is leaning out every division. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=146.24s)]
*  Now he's focused on the IRS. He's just got off of education. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=149.12s)]
*  He's going to be jumping into the Pentagon. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  So hopefully everyone understands they've got to go... [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=154.08s)]
*  What he does with his organization, he'll fly in, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=157.12s)]
*  and he'll say, everyone gets 15 minutes of FaceTime with the CEO, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=160.16s)]
*  at which time you describe what you're doing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=163.08s)]
*  A lot of people get raises on the spot. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  A lot of people say, I think I'm going to let you go. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  He will let you go right there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  So that is jarring a lot of the federal workforce. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=170.32s)]
*  And this was one moment, one lighter moment from their exchange, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=173.68s)]
*  that people are taking serious as if Donald Trump [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=177.28s)]
*  was looking for someone smarter. Watch. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=180.12s)]
*  You know, I wanted to find somebody smarter than him. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=182.84s)]
*  I searched all over. I just couldn't do it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=185.84s)]
*  I couldn't. I couldn't. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=188.84s)]
*  You really tried hard. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=190.0s)]
*  I couldn't find anyone smarter, right? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=191.0s)]
*  So we had it for the country. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=192.8s)]
*  But this is the thing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=195.68s)]
*  We settled on this guy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=197.48s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=198.2s)]
*  I'm just trying to be useful here. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  I think President Trump is a good man, and he's, you know... [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  That's nice the way he said that, you know? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  There's something nice about him. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=208.0s)]
*  There really is. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, because, I mean, the president's been so unfairly attacked in the media. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  It's truly outrageous. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  And I've spent, at this point, spent a lot of time with the president. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=218.96s)]
*  And not once have I seen him do something that was mean or cruel or wrong. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  Not once. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=230.2s)]
*  You know, I've known him for 30 years. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=232.92s)]
*  And I've never seen anybody take as much as he's taken. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=233.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=237.68s)]
*  And we've discussed this, and I'm like, how do you deal with it? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  Did I have a choice? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=241.2s)]
*  Well, you would say that to me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=242.64s)]
*  I'm like, what am I going to do? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=243.72s)]
*  Worry about it? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=245.68s)]
*  And, you know, and then culminating in two assassination attempts, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=246.32s)]
*  which resulted in your endorsement. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=249.68s)]
*  Well, I was going to do it anyway, but that was a precipitating event. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=251.84s)]
*  That speeded it up a little bit. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=256.64s)]
*  The day of the assassin. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=257.16s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=258.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=259.0s)]
*  I just sped it up, but I was going to do it anyway. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=259.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it is truly—there's so much that has happened under Trump's tenure, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=262.56s)]
*  even before he ran. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=267.44s)]
*  I mean, it was just months ago. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=268.32s)]
*  Ainsley, you and I were here on—was it Sunday or Saturday, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=269.88s)]
*  covering his first assassination attempt? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=272.88s)]
*  And I think there was something to Elon saying, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=275.52s)]
*  I think you're a good man, you know? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=278.76s)]
*  You haven't asked me to do anything unethical or anything like that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=280.6s)]
*  You're trying to serve the American people. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=283.8s)]
*  And when you get to the bottom of Doane and his relationship with Elon Musk, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=285.92s)]
*  this should be no surprise to anyone. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=289.6s)]
*  He campaigned on it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=292.36s)]
*  He said he was going to send Elon in there. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  I guess we should only be surprised that it's working, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=296.24s)]
*  but in the amount of waste that he's found, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=299.56s)]
*  but we shouldn't be surprised that it's happening. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=302.04s)]
*  I thought the interview really humanized them. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=303.48s)]
*  I liked when they were laughing together. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=306.16s)]
*  They seemed very relaxed with each other. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=308.20000000000005s)]
*  But they're actually just doing exactly what he promised when he ran. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=310.36s)]
*  And Democrats have run on the same message to save Americans money, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  to get rid of all the waste, but they never did it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  So Donald Trump comes into office and he exposes how much money is being spent on DEI programs, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  how much we're giving to other countries, wasteful spending. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=327.64s)]
*  So it's not a constitutional crisis when you're saving Americans money [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  and it's becoming more clear what the Democrats were doing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=334.88s)]
*  And this is not a hard sell. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=337.8s)]
*  They're saving $55 billion and then Elon is showing an interest in the idea [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  that would guarantee a $5,000 payment to every American, the Doge dividend. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=344.44s)]
*  Well, we're $2 trillion over budget. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  He's got to get to the point where he's got to cut a trillion. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  And when you cut, it definitely hurts. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=354.76s)]
*  But if you explain to people what you're doing in the big picture, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=357.08000000000004s)]
*  if the number one expenditure can be on our country and not on debt, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=359.88s)]
*  everyone understands that because we all took out mortgages. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=364.68s)]
*  You know you spend your first 15 years just paying off the interest on your mortgage. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  And sometimes, I know I did, you have situations where you have a credit card debt [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=371.8s)]
*  and a lot of your money goes to paying the minimum payments. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  You can't get ahead. That's the mindset. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=380.20000000000005s)]
*  So if the president could just put together a call-rove, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=382.16s)]
*  I know him and Carl don't get along great, but a call-rove whiteboard, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=386.32s)]
*  just say, here's the expenditures, here's our record revenue, and here's the interest. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=389.12s)]
*  Ron, I believe this is our only shot. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=393.88s)]
*  You got Elon Musk, who's the richest man in the world. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=395.96s)]
*  So he can't be bought. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=399.0s)]
*  You got a president of the United States that this is it for him. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  He doesn't need to be re-elected. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=402.91999999999996s)]
*  All of the rest of the people in Congress knew that we needed to cut. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=404.52s)]
*  All the former presidents. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=409.28s)]
*  They okayed the money. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  They knew this whole time, but they were too cowardly. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=411.56s)]
*  Because no one wants to be the bad guy. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=414.0s)]
*  You got two people that are okay with being the bad guy. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=416.35999999999996s)]
*  Here's the thing, ultimately, I know the Democrats' hair is on fire right now about Doge, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=419.12s)]
*  but expect in the future, Democratic presidents in the future, following Donald Trump, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=423.56s)]
*  are going to do exactly the same tactics and have the same legal interpretation [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=429.56s)]
*  of their constitutional duty to do exactly the same thing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=434.24s)]
*  So it might, it's new to all of us, but look for essentially the presidency [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=438.24s)]
*  being Trump-ified going forward. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=444.35999999999996s)]
*  People are going to do this for generations. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=446.12s)]
*  Programs that the Republicans like. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=449.68s)]
*  Really quickly before we move on to your great interview that you just had, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=450.48s)]
*  he also said NeuroLink, he's going to help work on the blind to see [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  and spinal cord injuries so that you can walk again. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=458.28s)]
*  They've already implanted in three different quadriplegics to use this computer [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=461.04s)]
*  to help control their thinking and help them all, help these quadriplegics. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=465.52s)]
*  For the record, for people out there, when it comes to being the bad guy, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=469.36s)]
*  that we are the good cops and Ainsley's the bad cop. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=472.36s)]
*  So you're always the bad cop. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=474.72s)]
*  I'm not jumping on that. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=476.24s)]
*  I'm not doing that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=477.4s)]
*  I commend the good cops. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=477.8s)]
*  I'm not doing that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=479.0s)]
*  That could be your own. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=479.76000000000005s)]
*  That's the way it works. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=480.68s)]
*  You're your own with this analysis. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=481.48s)]
*  Me and Steve aren't signing up. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SqQaYlsKps&t=483.40000000000003s)]
