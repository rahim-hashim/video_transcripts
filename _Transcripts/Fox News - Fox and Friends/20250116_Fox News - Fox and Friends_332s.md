# 'DISAPPOINTED': Jill Biden reveals true feelings on Pelosi's role in replacing ticket
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U)
*  In this latest CNN poll, looking back at Joe Biden's four years, his presidency has been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=0.0s)]
*  what? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=5.44s)]
*  61% said a failure, 38% said success. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=6.44s)]
*  Ainsley, who are those 38%? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm wondering. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  I'm wondering. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Biden's job approval is at 36%, according to this CNN poll. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  And it's not like he has the ability, you know, during this time that he was talking [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=18.32s)]
*  to the press. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=22.44s)]
*  He kept, gave everyone the Heisman, the press, not even friendly press for the most part, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=23.44s)]
*  until he was about to lose the candidacy and he ultimately lost it where he did seven network [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=28.44s)]
*  interviews in ten days. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=32.44s)]
*  But overall, people would point out that, hey, Truman left office, he was about 28% [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=34.72s)]
*  approval rating. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=39.28s)]
*  Now almost everyone puts him on the near-great level. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=40.28s)]
*  He'll never reach this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=42.96s)]
*  Much different because Truman goes through a war. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=44.92s)]
*  But I would also add that Joe Biden, every time he brings up what he did for green energy, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  all I hear is lie. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=51.88s)]
*  Because he called it the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=53.44s)]
*  Now he brags that it was a new green deal. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=55.68s)]
*  Well, he's not just bragging about that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=58.24s)]
*  Not only did he have his wife there, but he had Hunter Biden sitting there listening to [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=60.72s)]
*  the speech. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=64.76s)]
*  It's been reported that they are very active, pretty much running things at this point. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=65.76s)]
*  The Washington Post puts it this way, Jill Biden still hopes for a good ending. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=71.04s)]
*  This is the quote. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=74.4s)]
*  I've been thinking a lot about relationships. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=75.4s)]
*  Is it about Nancy Pelosi? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=78.2s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=79.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=80.68s)]
*  We were friends for 50 years. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=81.68s)]
*  She is using her teacher's voice now. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=83.0s)]
*  It was disappointing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=85.64s)]
*  So there's a lot of bitterness right now in the White House because Nancy Pelosi asked [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=86.68s)]
*  him to step aside. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=92.4s)]
*  The control room, could you put up that wide shot, shot through the window once again [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=95.2s)]
*  at Joe Biden giving the speech? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=99.36s)]
*  He's at the resolute desk. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  And then you see his family and the vice president. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  They are all dressed in black right there, as you can see. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  The next slide right there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=109.64s)]
*  If you look carefully and the New York Post points this out, it might actually be behind [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=111.32s)]
*  our logo. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=115.8s)]
*  Joe Biden is sitting on a pillow. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=116.8s)]
*  We don't know if it's just, it was a rough four years or whatever, but apparently he [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=119.8s)]
*  has taken now to sitting on a pillow. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=124.63999999999999s)]
*  Apparently he needs all the support he can get. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  So in that article from the Washington Post, they interviewed Jill Biden and it was at [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=129.84s)]
*  the beginning of January and it was just released. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=133.76s)]
*  There's a pillow. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=135.72s)]
*  And she said she's, where's the pillow? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=136.72s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=138.2s)]
*  Right there on the left. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=139.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=140.2s)]
*  So she said she's at peace with this ending, disappointed on how it all unfolded. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=141.2s)]
*  And then the reporter said, you are the keeper of family grudges. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=147.72s)]
*  And she said, you said that, I didn't. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=151.11999999999998s)]
*  But then the reporter says in her book, in her memoir, she said, Joe has the capacity [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=153.2s)]
*  to forgive. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=157.04s)]
*  He's incapable of holding a grudge, but that means I end up being the holder of grudges. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=158.04s)]
*  And then she went on to talk about Nancy Pelosi. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=162.48s)]
*  She thinks that he could serve for another four years. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=164.6s)]
*  She said when he stepped down, it was really hard that week in June. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=168.08s)]
*  And after the debate, she praised him, said, you did a great job. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  You knew all the facts. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  And then the next night when all of the press said he did a terrible job, she said, look, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  Joe, we're not going to let 90 minutes define the four years that you've been president. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=181.72000000000003s)]
*  And then with pardoning Hunter, Joe really wrestled with that decision. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=185.4s)]
*  He wasn't going to pardon Hunter, but things changed. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=189.12s)]
*  It became quite apparent and obvious that the Republicans weren't going to stop. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=191.84s)]
*  You're missing the point. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=196.52s)]
*  Joe Biden couldn't do the job. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=198.24s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi did a hatchet job, stabbed him in the back. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=200.36s)]
*  Absolutely, because she has no ethics, no values. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=203.56s)]
*  Friendship means nothing to her. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=205.96s)]
*  I mean, she barely having said that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=206.96s)]
*  So she got rid of him. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=209.56s)]
*  But she was just saying what Barack Obama and George Clooney and everyone was saying, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=211.44s)]
*  Jill Biden should be honest with herself and said a good spouse who cared about her husband [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  after 2022 and saw that he couldn't do the job would have said, this is the time to get [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=221.28s)]
*  out. We did well in the midterms. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=225.6s)]
*  You won the election, more votes than any Democrat in history. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=227.32s)]
*  So we got to get out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=230.72s)]
*  But instead, she's met at Nancy Pelosi for saying the truth. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=232.04s)]
*  She, if she really had good instincts, would have said, he can't do the job. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=235.76s)]
*  I got the same reports you do and you should get out of the 2022. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=239.4s)]
*  And the worst thing to happen, the Democratic Party was success in the midterms, because [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=242.96s)]
*  then they said Joe can stay. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=246.8s)]
*  No primary. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=249.12s)]
*  Brian, I want to take you to two years ago. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=250.36s)]
*  Rachel Campos Duffy was sitting on this couch and she called Jill Biden out and she said [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=252.64s)]
*  she needs to do something as a wife that was once married to a legislator because Sean [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=259.6s)]
*  was in Congress. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=264.52s)]
*  She should be doing more right here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=265.84s)]
*  It's clear that his and the White House, the first lady's press shop went after her so [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  hard went after this network where it's all been true. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=271.96s)]
*  It's all true. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=275.48s)]
*  An apology from Rachel. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=276.48s)]
*  And we all see it now. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=278.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=279.96s)]
*  And that's the story that's got to be written. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=280.96s)]
*  It's already come out in the Wall Street Journal, been expanded on. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  He couldn't work a full day. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=284.52s)]
*  And America got hurt by that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, Jill was just steamed that Nancy just wouldn't because she was a friend, wouldn't [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  just lie. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=292.32s)]
*  But Nancy is a politician. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=293.44s)]
*  Lives are on the line. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=294.44s)]
*  He's the commander. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=295.44s)]
*  100%. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=296.44s)]
*  Look at what happened in Afghanistan. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=297.44s)]
*  Lives are on the line. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=298.44s)]
*  This is not just like you were saying, some of these politicians like Karen Bass, they [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=299.44s)]
*  want just to be at the dinners and to travel around the world. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=302.32s)]
*  This is a serious job. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=306.02s)]
*  It is the highest job in our land. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=307.02s)]
*  America is very important and our soldiers are important. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=308.6s)]
*  So by allowing him to run and say that he could serve for another four years, put lives [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  in danger. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=315.88s)]
*  So true, Ansel. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=317.0s)]
*  Read all about it in the Washington Post. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  It's an eye opener. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=320.20000000000005s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEmLbnJ-Z2U&t=321.56s)]
