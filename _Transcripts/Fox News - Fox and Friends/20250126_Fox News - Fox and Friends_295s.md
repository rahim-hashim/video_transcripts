# 'Goya Cares' is helping locate trafficked migrant children
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE)
*  Goya Cares is teaming up with Border Czar Tom Holman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=0.0s)]
*  and investigative reporter Sarah Carter [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  to launch an initiative aimed at locating over 325,000 [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=5.66s)]
*  missing illegal migrant children [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  for Human Trafficking Awareness Month. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=13.14s)]
*  Here to discuss is Goya CEO Bob Yunnanwe [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=16.1s)]
*  and Fox News contributor Sarah Carter. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=18.34s)]
*  So back in the summer, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=21.22s)]
*  myself and Will and Pete interviewed Donald Trump. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=24.62s)]
*  I asked him directly, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=27.32s)]
*  will you find these children who are missing? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=28.34s)]
*  And he said, yes, of course. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=31.08s)]
*  And I was so heartened to learn [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=33.28s)]
*  that he was already starting on this right away, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=34.76s)]
*  as soon as he won, he got Tom Holman on it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=38.22s)]
*  So Bob, I'll start with you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=40.46s)]
*  What is Goya doing to help Tom Holman [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=41.96s)]
*  in the search for these children, which is so tragic? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=45.66s)]
*  Well, what a difference an election makes, right? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=48.0s)]
*  And people who care about, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=50.36s)]
*  this past administration has been active [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=52.58s)]
*  in bringing in people, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=54.980000000000004s)]
*  not just from the Northern Southern border, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=57.26s)]
*  but a parole system where we're flying people in [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=59.46s)]
*  from Nicaragua, Haiti, Venezuela and Cuba. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  But we were involved in the movie Sound of Freedom, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=66.5s)]
*  where we became aware of this tremendous evil [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=69.9s)]
*  of trafficking. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=74.1s)]
*  And so with that awareness, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=75.54s)]
*  we formed the coalition of different people, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=79.04s)]
*  organizations that to raise awareness, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=81.62s)]
*  we're going into schools with people like Monique Bear, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  Crime Soppers, different groups, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  to bring awareness to this problem. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  Because before that we weren't aware that this, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=94.08s)]
*  again, this last administration [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  was actively bringing this in. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=98.36s)]
*  We've gone from 85,000 children missing to 340,000, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=100.92s)]
*  but they're not missing, they've been sold. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=105.32s)]
*  They're purchased basically, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=107.66s)]
*  and then handed off to sponsors, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=109.24s)]
*  40 children at one address. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=111.8s)]
*  That's not a home, it's a business. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=114.66s)]
*  You're absolutely right, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=117.1s)]
*  and I love that you're going into the schools, Bob, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=118.3s)]
*  because so many of these kids [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=119.9s)]
*  are ending up in the school system. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  And you're able to give the signs [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=123.94s)]
*  and let them know that there's help for them [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=126.34s)]
*  and resources should that happen. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  But obviously this is going to take law enforcement, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=131.12s)]
*  right, Sarah? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=133.42s)]
*  Oh, it's gonna take a huge cooperation [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=134.66s)]
*  with federal, local, state law enforcement officials, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=136.26s)]
*  as well as I think our partners in the Western hemisphere. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=139.72s)]
*  There's no way to stop this kind of crisis alone. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=142.62s)]
*  I mean, everybody has to be working together. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=146.32s)]
*  Bob's right with Goya Cares, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=148.62s)]
*  we're able to get out there [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=150.2s)]
*  and educate students in the schools. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=151.45999999999998s)]
*  We're able to find within the communities [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=153.5s)]
*  those kids that may be trafficked, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=156.06s)]
*  that may be afraid, they can go to someone, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=158.06s)]
*  feel safe, and report what's happening. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=160.06s)]
*  And then, but it's the aftercare [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=162.54s)]
*  that's gonna be the most important. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=164.14s)]
*  That's what I wanna know, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=164.98s)]
*  what happens after you find them? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  What is happening to these children? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=166.74s)]
*  The Biden administration, Tom Holman, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=168.57999999999998s)]
*  you guys find them and then what happens? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=171.24s)]
*  Well, I think that the very first thing is mental health. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=173.64s)]
*  I mean, a lot of what we're dealing with now [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=176.74s)]
*  and finding their parents, their actual guardians, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=178.34s)]
*  because a lot of these children have come into the country, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=180.52s)]
*  have disappeared into homes where they're being sold, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=182.98s)]
*  as Bob has stated. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=187.08s)]
*  So we need to locate their guardians. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=188.06s)]
*  One thing I can say, Rachel, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=190.26s)]
*  I spoke with President Bukele, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=191.56s)]
*  I've been to El Salvador a number of times. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=194.16s)]
*  We know that children have been trying to contact relatives [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=196.6s)]
*  HHS has a hotline. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=201.22s)]
*  Some of these children have called that hotline. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  These children are gonna find their way back to safety [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=206.02s)]
*  because Tom Holman is gonna be leading that effort [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=208.88s)]
*  with President Trump. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  And the people who are trafficking these children [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  in the United States need to be held [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=215.32s)]
*  to the full extent of the law. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  They absolutely have to be punished. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=219.52s)]
*  There is no way that we can allow this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=221.32s)]
*  to continue to happen. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=223.86s)]
*  We're a nation that is based on principles and morals [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=224.98000000000002s)]
*  and we can't sit around and we can't accuse anyone else [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=228.44s)]
*  of doing anything if we're not willing to take care [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  of the problem that has happened in this country [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  because of a wide open border under President Biden. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=236.1s)]
*  Well, Bob, as you know, we were complicit in this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=239.2s)]
*  Congress, the Democrats refused to do DNA tests [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=242.32s)]
*  on these children. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=244.61999999999998s)]
*  And then they handed them off to people we don't know. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=245.76s)]
*  They're telling me I have to wrap [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=247.88s)]
*  one last sentence from you, Bob. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  This is the biggest industry in the world. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=251.39999999999998s)]
*  It's the money and the power that we seek. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=253.72s)]
*  This administration who cares about our kids, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=257.54s)]
*  they're gonna solve this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=260.66s)]
*  We've already not one week into this administration [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=262.16s)]
*  and we're already saving thousands of people. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=264.7s)]
*  It's unbelievable and it's remarkable [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=267.62s)]
*  what you've done, Sarah. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=270.26s)]
*  And Bob, there are very few CEOs who wanna take on [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=271.56s)]
*  an ugly issue like this. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=274.44s)]
*  God bless you for putting your efforts [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=276.18s)]
*  and your money behind something like this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=277.86s)]
*  Very few presidents. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=280.26s)]
*  And very few presidents. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=281.68s)]
*  Amen to that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04-ft07I6pE&t=283.06s)]
