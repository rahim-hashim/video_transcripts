# Dana Perino: 'What was Joe Biden talking about?'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY)
*  Joe Biden in his final TV interview was indoors and he had this warning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=0.0s)]
*  I really am concerned about, uh, how fragile democracy is. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=5.36s)]
*  That sounds corny, but I mean, I really, or I really am concerned because, uh, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=11.92s)]
*  you've heard me say it a hundred times. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=18.8s)]
*  I really think we're in an inflection point in history here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=20.52s)]
*  It came just a day after he sent a message in his farewell speech. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Uh, one fan of the speech said this, former White House press secretary, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=27.639999999999997s)]
*  Jen Psaki, who praised her old boss for putting the Trump team on notice. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=31.0s)]
*  Uh, because one thing she said is we are in danger of being run by oligarchs, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=35.64s)]
*  tech titans, Dana Perino is here now. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=41.08s)]
*  Do you also praise Joe Biden for putting America on notice? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  I really tried the other night in listening to the speech, I was there to do [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=49.32s)]
*  the commentary that I, I usually can find something complimentary to say. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=52.76s)]
*  And plus it's his last speech. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=57.04s)]
*  So you want to say, nice job, sir. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=58.44s)]
*  Um, I know you love your country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=61.12s)]
*  You served it well. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=62.68s)]
*  It must hurt really a lot that the country rejected you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=63.36s)]
*  And then I'm listening to the speech and I'm like, what is he talking about? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=67.36s)]
*  And one of the things about putting the tech people on notice, what did Mark [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=72.68s)]
*  Zuckerberg, for example, just come out and say about this particular White [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=76.36s)]
*  House when Jen Psaki was president, uh, press secretary, that the team over at [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=79.36s)]
*  the White House was calling up and screaming at Facebook executives saying [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=84.08s)]
*  you must take all of this down. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=88.64s)]
*  Like for example, COVID, COVID vaccine information. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=90.4s)]
*  And now that actually went all the way up to the Supreme Court. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=93.48s)]
*  And so now all of a sudden they don't like the tech giants, but the tech [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=96.56s)]
*  giants are one, is their self-interest? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=99.96s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=102.32s)]
*  But also they're responding to the will of the people. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=103.12s)]
*  And I also think that they believe that free speech needs to be protected. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=105.24s)]
*  That's the danger to democracy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=108.72s)]
*  I just encourage everyone to understand that Mark Zuckerberg, whatever you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=110.2s)]
*  think their motives are, they were forced out of that party. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=113.36s)]
*  Uh, they were, they were blistered. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=115.88s)]
*  They had really no choice today. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=117.16s)]
*  Uh, the mayor of New York city will be in Mar-a-Lago this after he's already [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=119.56s)]
*  met, uh, mayor Adams with Tom Holman about some way to cooperate, even though [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=123.36s)]
*  we're in a sanctuary city, how significant is this? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=127.6s)]
*  Well, I think if you think about Mark, uh, Eric Adams wanted to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=130.52s)]
*  do more on the migrant front. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=134.48s)]
*  He's got a sanctuary city, but also remember he was there shaking [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=136.28s)]
*  hands, welcoming the migrants. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=139.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=140.32s)]
*  It's complicated. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=140.76s)]
*  But could president Trump help New York the way that Biden refused to? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=141.83999999999997s)]
*  Yes, maybe. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=146.04s)]
*  And so I think a meeting face to face, having a relationship, having the power [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  to be able to go down and convene a meeting, I think that's all important. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=150.88s)]
*  I don't think that necessarily leads to a pardon for him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=154.44s)]
*  I think he's got a lot of problems outside of just the ones that we've heard about. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=157.6s)]
*  Ruby, very interesting because he's got nowhere else to turn it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  And he did get the, he was given the Heisman, the stiff arm by the current [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=164.72s)]
*  administration for two and a half years. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  No, it'll be great to see if the city can do something. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  One about the migrants, the hotels, lots of things have been degraded. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=172.88s)]
*  Quality of life has come down. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=176.4s)]
*  We have to fix that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=178.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  What's coming up on your show? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=179.6s)]
*  Well, Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota is the nominee for the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=180.68s)]
*  department of Homeland security and her hearing starts at nine o'clock. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=184.32s)]
*  So we will have that all the hot button issues for that one as well. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=187.88s)]
*  Is there any cabinet nominee that should be worried about so far getting [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  confirmed that's already testified in your mind? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=194.92s)]
*  That's already testified. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=197.56s)]
*  No. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=198.56s)]
*  What about the ones coming down the pike? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=199.08s)]
*  Possibly. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=200.68s)]
*  But for me, like the Democrats and Josh Holmes, the other night on Bret [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=201.28s)]
*  Bear show said he's never seen the Democrats this unprepared for any of the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=204.96s)]
*  hearings, the only person who is more unprepared for things is you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=209.28s)]
*  And that's a shot because you took a shot at me in the commercial break to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=214.04s)]
*  the Fox and friends people. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=218.04s)]
*  They said, he said he'd prefer to have Bill Hemmer. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  Chris, would you ask, would you, you have to escort Dana out of this. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=221.68s)]
*  How dare she? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  When Dana turns on you. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=226.92s)]
*  Hey, meanwhile, okay, Dana, six, I'm not worthy. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=231.2s)]
*  Why don't you go out and tell us what's next? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=233.88s)]
*  Well, Deuce is on the loose getting the pulse of the people ahead of the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  inauguration. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  I think he might be out there now if we continue to roll the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=240.2s)]
*  prompt. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=242.0s)]
*  There it was. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=242.32s)]
*  It was the inauguration. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=242.76s)]
*  Oh, well, yeah, we're going to take a break. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=243.83999999999997s)]
*  Let's just zoom out and then they don't apologize. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV10byRFfSY&t=245.23999999999998s)]
