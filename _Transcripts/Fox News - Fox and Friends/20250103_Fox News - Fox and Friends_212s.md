# Trump UNLEASHES on Biden's 'nonexistent leadership' following terror attack
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU)
*  As investigators search for the link between the New Orleans attack and Las Vegas explosion, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=0.0s)]
*  President-elect Trump is reminding Americans he will soon be back in the White House. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=5.26s)]
*  Saying on True Social, our country is a disaster. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=9.72s)]
*  This is what happens when you have open borders with weak, ineffective, and virtually non-existent [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  leadership. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=17.88s)]
*  Only strength and powerful leadership will stop it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=19.36s)]
*  Fox and Friends Weekend co-host Rachel Campos-Duffey, I mean, he's right. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=23.22s)]
*  We know what was happening with ISIS when he was in office. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=28.02s)]
*  They were on the run. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=31.3s)]
*  He destroyed them. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=32.38s)]
*  Right now it looks like they're emerging stronger and we have no response right now, Rachel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=34.1s)]
*  Yeah, our foreign policy is also dysfunctional. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=41.66s)]
*  Just think about it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=44.82s)]
*  We're still funding the Taliban through NGOs in Afghanistan. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=45.82s)]
*  We're funding Islamist rebels in Syria. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=49.66s)]
*  And what we need to do is focus on security here at home. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=53.28s)]
*  For me, Lawrence, it's really personal. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=58.14s)]
*  Donald Trump is about to assume office on January 20th. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  I'm bringing my family, my children, over to the inauguration because as you know, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=64.5s)]
*  Sean is nominated to be a Secretary of Transportation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=69.06s)]
*  And we have an FBI, a DOD, and a Homeland Security that has given us zero confidence. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=73.98s)]
*  They've said nothing with the border open and terrorists flowing over our borders. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=83.02000000000001s)]
*  They've been directing agents to go after political dissidents from January 6th instead [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  of going after terrorists. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=94.62s)]
*  We know that within the military, they were flagging Pete Hegseth as a white supremacist [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=96.62s)]
*  because of a tattoo. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=103.34s)]
*  The ultimate patriot. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=104.34s)]
*  And meanwhile, we have this guy who was a veteran who turned to ISIS. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=105.34s)]
*  So this is so dysfunctional. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  Right now, you know, Lawrence, Donald Trump and senior and senators are calling for Donald [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=111.34s)]
*  Trump's national security team, Tulsi, Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, Pete Hegseth, and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=117.78s)]
*  Cash Patel to be confirmed immediately because they don't trust this current administration's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=124.14s)]
*  FBI, DOD, and Homeland Security. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=131.74s)]
*  And I don't blame them. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=136.5s)]
*  Lawrence, we still don't know anything about the two people who tried to assassinate Donald [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=137.86s)]
*  Trump this summer. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=142.46s)]
*  We know nothing about this situation. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=143.62s)]
*  These are not crimes that have been solved. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=147.14s)]
*  And yet I'm supposed to feel okay taking my kids to an inauguration on January 20th with [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=149.06s)]
*  this team in place for national security. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=154.34s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=157.28s)]
*  Well, it also goes back to if you can't keep the president-elect, the former president, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=158.28s)]
*  of the best security apparatus, this is what we were told. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=164.14s)]
*  And they let a 21-year-old shoot him literally in the ear, almost got him in the head. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=168.5s)]
*  So I mean, how do we expect to be safe, especially when the threats of Iran and so on? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=174.77999999999997s)]
*  So we'll be following. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=181.1s)]
*  Hopefully Congress will get some act right, confirm the folks so we can get this show [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=182.7s)]
*  on the road. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=186.38s)]
*  We'll be watching though, Rachel. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=187.38s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=188.54s)]
*  Lawrence, one last thing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=189.54s)]
*  I'm down with getting to the bottom of Islamic threats in America and abroad. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=191.94s)]
*  But those two individuals that tried to shoot Donald Trump, those were Democrats. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=197.5s)]
*  Those were Americans. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=201.7s)]
*  And we need to talk about that as well. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=202.7s)]
*  And so is the guy that did this in New Orleans as well, American citizen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  We'll be following it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=209.26s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH-dM_v74hU&t=210.54s)]
