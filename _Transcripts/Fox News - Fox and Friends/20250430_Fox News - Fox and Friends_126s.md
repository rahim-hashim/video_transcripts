# 'It's a video!': AOC confronted on possible 2028 presidential bid
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g)
*  And then you have AOC. AOC released that social media video that we've been talking about. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=0.0s)]
*  And then she was asked by Fox News whether or not she would run for president. Watch both of these. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=4.48s)]
*  You know, Idaho, I am so touched being here. I'm a girl from the Bronx. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=11.52s)]
*  Don't let them trick us into thinking we are enemies. We are one. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=17.92s)]
*  So, running for president after the campaign style video you put out? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  You thinking about running for president? Or Senate? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=27.84s)]
*  I mean, listen, it's a video. And frankly, I think what people should be most concerned about [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=30.8s)]
*  is the fact that Republicans are trying to cut Medicaid right now and people's health care [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=38.96s)]
*  is in danger. And that's really what my central focus is. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=43.2s)]
*  This moment isn't about campaigns or elections or about politics. It's about making sure people [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=46.0s)]
*  are protected. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, she's a great speaker and she's got a lot of buttons. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=52.64s)]
*  Sounds like a yes, but the problem is she has not won over her party. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=55.44s)]
*  Has she written any legislation? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=58.0s)]
*  Not yet. She opened up with the New Green Deal, which she actually wrote, I guess, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=59.84s)]
*  as a bartender. Because the first day she's like, oh, I have this 2,000 page document [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=63.36s)]
*  to revolutionize our economy. Anybody else? So, who wrote that? I don't know. But Senator [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=68.4s)]
*  Markey was right over her shoulder. And since then we haven't heard much. And you know who [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=72.56s)]
*  doesn't see her? The people of Queens that elect her. Doesn't really let go in there that much. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=76.16s)]
*  Can I defend AOC, though? I mean, think about this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=81.12s)]
*  At least she answered questions. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=83.12s)]
*  She answers questions. At least she can put a sentence together. Her ideas are crazy, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=84.24s)]
*  but at least she has ideas. Imagine watching Kamala Harris, the last election, and saying- [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=88.88s)]
*  What do you stand for? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=95.28s)]
*  What do you stand for? She doesn't do any interviews. At least AOC will talk to Fox News. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=96.24s)]
*  I mean, at least she did the interview with our Fox Digital team. She has a policy [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  prescription. It's crazy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=105.52s)]
*  Would she sit down with Lawrence Jones? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. AOC, will you come on the program? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=109.28s)]
*  There you go. Now you're talking. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  Are you going to ask her out in front of us? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=112.56s)]
*  I'm going to ask her right now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvxZctvXO6g&t=114.0s)]
