# New poll shows liberal women are unhappy and lonely in 2025
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM)
*  Okay, so we have a new poll out that shows liberal women are the most unhappy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=0.0s)]
*  Lonely and conservative women ages 18 to 40 are married at rates that are 20% [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=5.82s)]
*  Percentage points higher than liberal women in the same age group. Look at these numbers you guys [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=12.0s)]
*  So liberal mayor liberals are married at 31% [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=17.1s)]
*  Moderates at 37% conservatives 51% of them are married [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  So some so some people saying with this study that that might be an indication of why they're they're happy to say [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=25.32s)]
*  So this study has been done for 20 years [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=32.92s)]
*  It used to be or more than that you think it's a more like 30 years [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=36.38s)]
*  It used to be that liberal men were the most unhappy and now things have switched and liberal women are now the most unhappy [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=39.56s)]
*  And so the question that people so this even compares men to women as well [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=46.96s)]
*  Yeah, it does but we're looking at we're comparing moderate liberal and conservative women conservative women just [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=51.0s)]
*  Markedly more happy. I am not married. I'm conservative, but I'm still happy but she's working [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=58.92s)]
*  But I will give a piece of advice to liberal women dye your hair a normal color shave your arm [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=65.12s)]
*  Get the cardio I don't know I don't know I that might scare a guy [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=72.56s)]
*  And the armpits [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=81.0s)]
*  That's terrifying cuz they're all like even um, what is it Doug? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=83.08s)]
*  I'm off starter. She's like all under that. I think she has like an oil to help. Oh, yeah [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=86.16s)]
*  She was on though. This is such a great story. She's on Instagram selling an oil for her armpit hair [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA9RXQlZqxM&t=90.28s)]
