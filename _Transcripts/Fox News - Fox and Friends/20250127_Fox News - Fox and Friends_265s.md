# Tom Homan puts migrants on notice: 'If you're here illegally, you're on the table'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM)
*  This is Trump border czar Tom Horman putting illegal immigrants on notice after overseeing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=0.0s)]
*  agents in Chicago carrying out targeted enforcement operations. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=4.48s)]
*  If you're in a country illegally, you're on the table because it's not okay to violate [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=8.56s)]
*  laws of this country. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=15.52s)]
*  You've got to remember, every time you enter this country illegally, you violated a crime [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=16.52s)]
*  under Title 8, United States Code 1325. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=19.56s)]
*  It's a crime. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=21.88s)]
*  So if you're in a country illegally, you've got a problem. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=22.88s)]
*  This coming as the DEA arrested 49 in Colorado, many connected to the Venezuelan gang, Tundere [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=25.84s)]
*  Agua, senior advisor to U.S. Customs and Border Protections, Ron Villatello joins us [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=30.88s)]
*  now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=35.8s)]
*  So, Ron, I want to get your, good morning to you, sir. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=36.8s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to the latest number we received. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=38.84s)]
*  There's been 23, 2,373 detainers logged. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=41.4s)]
*  There has been 1,797. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=47.8s)]
*  Tell me about these operations. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=52.0s)]
*  When I start seeing WIN codes from the DEA, ATF, as well as ICE, that tells me that's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=53.6s)]
*  a joint task force. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=58.2s)]
*  That's absolutely right. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=61.08s)]
*  Good morning, Lawrence. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=62.08s)]
*  This is what winning looks like. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=63.08s)]
*  This is the handcuffs being taken off the front line. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=64.74s)]
*  My former colleagues in ICE who are now out looking for the worst of the worst criminals [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=67.24s)]
*  all over the country, who are in the country illegally and have committed crimes in the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=71.82s)]
*  jurisdictions in which they live. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=76.32s)]
*  And so the front line of ICE, the enforcement removal operations, with the support of the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  White House, who has taken a historic political victory and turned it into winning on the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=83.72s)]
*  front line, are going out and knocking on the doors of people who are in the country [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  illegally who have committed other crimes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=92.36s)]
*  And 2,300 is a great number. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=94.88s)]
*  But let's see where we're at. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=96.48s)]
*  This is just beginning. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=98.4s)]
*  And so, again, the handcuffs are off. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=99.64s)]
*  They're going to be allowed to do their jobs in ways that they've never done before, just [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=101.76s)]
*  like we are doing on the front line at CBP. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=105.84s)]
*  Historic, unprecedented support from our heroes in the military, a declaration from the president [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=108.36s)]
*  that gives CBP new authorities to protect our borders so that we can make America safe [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=114.68s)]
*  again by having a secure border and safe streets in the interior. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=119.68s)]
*  One of the things that illegal migrants do that make it difficult for ICE agents to do [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=124.04s)]
*  their job is some of them have children in America where they become citizens, but they [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  aren't citizens. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=132.24s)]
*  JD Vance took on this issue on Sunday. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=134.32000000000002s)]
*  Let's watch it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=137.72s)]
*  If you're an illegal alien and you come here temporarily, hopefully your child does not [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=138.72s)]
*  become an American citizen by virtue of just having been born on American soil. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=144.44s)]
*  It's a very basic principle in American immigration law that if you want to become an American [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=149.4s)]
*  citizen and you've done it the right way and the American people and their collective wisdom [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=154.52s)]
*  have welcomed you into our national community, then you become a citizen. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=159.36s)]
*  But temporary residents, people who come in here whether legally or illegally and don't [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=163.48s)]
*  plan to stay, their children shouldn't become American citizens. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=168.56s)]
*  So Ron, obviously this is going to be litigated in the courts now, but for our audience that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=172.12s)]
*  don't know, how do y'all handle those situations when you have an illegal migrant that's here [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=176.0s)]
*  in the country, but suddenly their children are American citizens because they had them [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=180.32s)]
*  through the process, what do you do when you arrive at their door? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=185.0s)]
*  Most men and women, the frontline at ERO, handle this situation with the utmost professionalism [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=190.72s)]
*  and compassion. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=196.2s)]
*  They understand that when they knock on that door, they are at great risk. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=197.2s)]
*  They don't know what's on the other side of that door, but in some cases that turns into [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=201.2s)]
*  a situation in which they have to compassionately adjudicate what goes on on the other side [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=205.12s)]
*  of that door. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=209.88s)]
*  So they take somebody into custody. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=210.88s)]
*  If kids need to be cared for, they call the right authorities. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=212.24s)]
*  They place them with other family members. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=215.26s)]
*  We've done this throughout time and they continue to do it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=217.56s)]
*  They're very good at it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  And so compassion and professionalism is the word of the day, if you will, the words of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  the day, if you will. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=227.08s)]
*  And so they know how to do this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  They will do it each and every day. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  And I'm proud to watch it happen. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=232.0s)]
*  And we want to do more of it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=234.24s)]
*  We want to make America safe again. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=236.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=238.28s)]
*  And you guys are having the cameras in there to see exactly what's happening. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=239.28s)]
*  So there's no ambiguity at the end of this. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=242.12s)]
*  You're seeing the ICE professionals, DEA, ATF, do the right thing. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=244.92s)]
*  And it's for the whole public to see. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=249.28s)]
*  Ron, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=250.44s)]
*  Be safe out there. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=252.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=253.48s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x953D8MSuTM&t=254.48s)]
