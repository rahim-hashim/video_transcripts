# Trump, Melania arrive at St. John's Episcopal Church ahead of inauguration
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg)
*  Let's bring in Kellyanne Conway. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=0.0s)]
*  Eight years after she helped Donald Trump beat all the odds [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=2.94s)]
*  and win the presidency, he's now back in office. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=6.9s)]
*  And you're back with this famous red, white, and blue outfit [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=9.78s)]
*  like you were eight years ago. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=12.82s)]
*  Just missing the hat. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=14.58s)]
*  On our show. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=15.42s)]
*  Putting this historic day in context. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=16.26s)]
*  What's the main difference as we watch [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=18.22s)]
*  the traditions and the popular circumstances play out, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=20.5s)]
*  Kellyanne? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=22.94s)]
*  The main difference is that this still political outsider [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=23.42s)]
*  insurgent has also been an incumbent. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=26.34s)]
*  He knows Washington. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=28.56s)]
*  I think Washington is bending to his will. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=29.72s)]
*  Also, I want to make a comment given the fact [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=32.12s)]
*  that Chad Program had a conversation with you [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=34.32s)]
*  about the House majority when we got there. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=36.44s)]
*  I was in the Oval Office today. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=38.6s)]
*  Paul Ryan ushered in and said, we don't have the votes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=42.32s)]
*  To repeal and replace Obamacare. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=42.68s)]
*  This was after two months of solid work. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  And months before that, in transition [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=46.32s)]
*  with President Trump, working the phones, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=47.86s)]
*  hosting the Tuesday group, hosting the House Freedom [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=49.8s)]
*  Caucus. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=51.68s)]
*  I think that 40-plus seat margin was distorting. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=52.44s)]
*  It allowed there to be factions and for very little [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=56.38s)]
*  to get done. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=59.02s)]
*  Now with the slim margin, you saw the speaker vote. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=59.82s)]
*  Not a squeaker vote. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  I mean, is a squeaker a speaker vote? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=63.54s)]
*  But they all came together. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=65.3s)]
*  And what did President Trump say to them? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=66.34s)]
*  I think that's going to be the theme here, Brian. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=67.62s)]
*  He said to them, look, it's disrespectful to the people. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=69.1s)]
*  They gave us this mandate for security, prosperity, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=72.22s)]
*  safe streets, peace, et cetera, affordability. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=75.3s)]
*  We have to get this done for them. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=77.78s)]
*  And I think, look, as much as what's different, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=79.98s)]
*  there's a lot that's the same. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=82.22s)]
*  When I went to the Blair House the morning, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=84.82s)]
*  eight years ago this morning, that's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  when it all became real to me. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=88.6s)]
*  Sitting in the Blair House, recognizing [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=89.72s)]
*  that we were about to go to the church, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=91.72s)]
*  and then looking at the schedule for everything after that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=93.44s)]
*  But after the inauguration, the luncheon, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=95.55999999999999s)]
*  we got ready to work. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  He called us on the. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=98.08s)]
*  I didn't even go to my office for hours. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=98.8s)]
*  I never saw it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=100.41999999999999s)]
*  Because he had us in the Oval Office. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=100.96s)]
*  He called the press into the Oval Office [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=102.83999999999999s)]
*  so America could see what was happening in real time. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=104.63999999999999s)]
*  Brian, I think tomorrow America wakes up, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=107.96s)]
*  and things do feel differently. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=109.89999999999999s)]
*  They can say we're out of the Paris climate, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=111.28s)]
*  the DEI nonsense is as gone as a president can [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=113.7s)]
*  do through the executive pen. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  Energy security, if not dominance on our way. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=118.86000000000001s)]
*  Deportations. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=121.06s)]
*  Things are just going to look measurably different. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=122.26s)]
*  But Kellyanne, right now, because we're [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=124.26s)]
*  waiting for the president-elect to leave Blair House, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=125.9s)]
*  what is he doing? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=128.68s)]
*  Is he reviewing the speech? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=129.86s)]
*  What type of guy is he? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=131.78s)]
*  Is he making phone calls still? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=133.10000000000002s)]
*  Because he likes to have personal contact [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=135.02s)]
*  with the people. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=137.3s)]
*  Is he working on those executive orders? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=138.22s)]
*  What does he like to do? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=140.18s)]
*  Well, if it's anything like eight years ago, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=141.38s)]
*  he's probably now in the breakfast room, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  beautiful breakfast arranged with his family [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=144.72s)]
*  and senior staff, ready to go to church. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  Probably has the hard copy of the speech [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  in a Sharpie in each of his hands. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=150.8s)]
*  And yes, he's maybe taking calls, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=153.32000000000002s)]
*  looking at the TV, probably watching Fox News. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=156.24s)]
*  I think we think that's gonna be J.D. Vance. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  That's great, wonderful. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=160.4s)]
*  And anyway, we all know that he takes that Sharpie Lawrence [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=161.84s)]
*  and makes his own personal flourish last minute, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=165.88s)]
*  moves the things around. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  So that could possibly be the case. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=169.54000000000002s)]
*  But it's really nice to wake up at the Blair House [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=171.24s)]
*  on the day you're going to become the president [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  of the United States and see your family members all there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=175.54000000000002s)]
*  And the senior staff is gonna come in with you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=178.26000000000002s)]
*  So that's the scene eight years ago. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  I'm gonna bet that's the scene exactly right now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=182.22s)]
*  Yeah, Kelly and Tim Scott reiterated what you said. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=184.58s)]
*  He's gonna be working all day. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=186.78s)]
*  The senators will be working. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=188.10000000000002s)]
*  What's going through their mind [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=189.66000000000003s)]
*  and what's happening at the White House? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=191.14000000000001s)]
*  Because the Bidens are leaving now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=192.78s)]
*  Do you think they're emotional saying goodbye to the staff? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=194.74s)]
*  Or do you think we're ready for this to be over with? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=197.26000000000002s)]
*  Well, America's ready for that to be over with respectfully. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=200.58s)]
*  This man is leaving office as sort of like a blip [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=203.08s)]
*  between the two Trump presidencies. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=206.36s)]
*  Folks will forget it with a semi-call. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=208.4s)]
*  I don't mean to be rude. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  The man has had a 50-some year career. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=211.24s)]
*  That's part of the issue here. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  It is emotional because Joe Biden thought [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  he would run successfully for a second term. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=218.3s)]
*  Donald Trump, indicted, impeached, all of that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=221.16000000000003s)]
*  Really thought he could coast through. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  And he's not just being turned out of the White House [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=225.84s)]
*  because of President Trump. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=228.0s)]
*  Seven months ago, he was turned out of his own party [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=229.54000000000002s)]
*  because of that debate performance. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=231.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=233.3s)]
*  But I have to say, Joe, there's Vice President, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=234.3s)]
*  one of the youngest we've ever had in our nation's history. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=236.34s)]
*  And Usha Vance's lovely wife as well. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=239.62s)]
*  They've been all over the inaugural circuit. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  Walking into the church. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=243.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=244.22s)]
*  They are running 40 minutes late as they walk in. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=245.22s)]
*  They were supposed to, on theory, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=247.06s)]
*  walk in at about 8 o'clock. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=249.34s)]
*  And now we also expect the President-elect, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=250.98000000000002s)]
*  Jim Melania, to follow 15 minutes after. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=252.94s)]
*  They're coming. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=255.34s)]
*  You know, Kellyanne, as we look at the last number of weeks [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  since the election, this has been probably [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=258.74s)]
*  the most consequential pre-presidency [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=264.12s)]
*  in modern history. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=267.72s)]
*  I mean, just by virtue of his social media [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=268.8s)]
*  and his public appearances, he's been [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=272.54s)]
*  able to shape not only how the world looks at America, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=274.64s)]
*  but has gotten the world to do stuff. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  The stock market has reacted. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=280.48s)]
*  Social media has reacted. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=283.12s)]
*  And he knows so much more about what he's about to do [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=285.4s)]
*  than he did eight years ago, because he's been there. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=289.14s)]
*  And now, you know, everybody's behind him. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=291.23999999999995s)]
*  You've got business behind him. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  He's more popular in the polls. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  That's the presidential motorcade right there. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  There they are. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=297.28s)]
*  They're leaving Blair House. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=297.67999999999995s)]
*  It's just about a two-minute drive around the block. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=299.44s)]
*  So this is going to be pretty quick. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  But he's stacked the deck in his favor. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=303.44s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  And look, that list of campaign promises [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=308.12s)]
*  is actually a governing blueprint as well. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=310.23999999999995s)]
*  So it's not difficult to understand [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=312.0s)]
*  what his priorities are, what he believes [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=313.5s)]
*  is mandated. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=314.96s)]
*  Sorry to interrupt you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=315.46s)]
*  This is the president's president-elect's motorcade. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  He departed from the Blair House, we're being told. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so you're not going to see the president come out [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=320.35999999999996s)]
*  directed for security measures where [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=323.08s)]
*  you see that little flap, that green tint that they have now [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=324.64s)]
*  for the president. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=327.88s)]
*  So if you're looking to rent a black SUV, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=328.88s)]
*  you're going to have trouble today. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=331.08s)]
*  It looks like he's quartered the market on it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=332.41999999999996s)]
*  But they're going to be heading down the road. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=334.32s)]
*  Pretty soon, he'll be in the beast. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=336.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=336.96s)]
*  You mentioned, Lawrence, they have this deceptive SUVs [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=339.28s)]
*  to make sure. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=343.67999999999995s)]
*  Kellyann, you know this area. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=344.96s)]
*  What are we seeing? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=346.32s)]
*  So that's the neighborhood. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=347.47999999999996s)]
*  You're looking at aerial shot right across there [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=349.2s)]
*  is St. John's. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  I want to make two comments about St. John's Church. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=352.64s)]
*  This obviously is a tradition for presidents [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=355.24s)]
*  to go there for mass, attend that with family and close [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  friends and allies. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  Remember, this is the one that the protesters put on fire. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=361.64s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=366.03999999999996s)]
*  I remember talking to President Trump that Sunday night. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  It was late on a Sunday night. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=369.32s)]
*  And of course, he walked over there with some others [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=370.84s)]
*  the next day or two days later, held up the Bible. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=372.92s)]
*  But this is a man who's been shot in the face. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=375.92s)]
*  This is a man who's been through so much. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  And that changed him, Kellyann. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=380.04s)]
*  That changed him. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=381.04s)]
*  I think that this is an incredibly important moment [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=381.56s)]
*  for President Trump to begin his day, three short, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  three hours in change before he becomes our 47th president, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=387.16s)]
*  to go and truly reflect in this house of worship. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  We've all talked to him about that experience. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=394.04s)]
*  We know what he has said publicly many times about it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=396.36s)]
*  I think that he's going to reflect and respect [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  this aspect of this presidential tradition. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=402.52000000000004s)]
*  This is also, as we know, he's a guy who always says, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=405.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm superstitious, I'm a suit. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=407.20000000000005s)]
*  I like things to be the same. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=408.44s)]
*  He's also someone who loves tradition. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  And today is filled with tradition. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  And one other thing that is different about eight years ago, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=415.08000000000004s)]
*  and given the fact that, and you brought it up, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=418.12s)]
*  the guy's been shot. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  There have been two assassination attempts on him. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=421.8s)]
*  Security is different. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=424.76s)]
*  Security is just different. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=426.44s)]
*  Certainly is. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=427.48s)]
*  Period. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=428.0s)]
*  It feels that way. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=429.6s)]
*  We're always worried about his supporters. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=430.52s)]
*  They don't have security. Look at them. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  There's throngs in them. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  They drive here through the night just to be a piece of this, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=434.64s)]
*  even though they know there's no public event. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  They still came. They stayed. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=441.0s)]
*  They want to be a part of this. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=442.4s)]
*  There's the president right there, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=443.2s)]
*  Donald Trump right there walking out. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=444.35999999999996s)]
*  There you go. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=447.0s)]
*  Quick pause. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=447.52s)]
*  Going to wait for Melania Trump as well. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=448.08s)]
*  So think about what he must be thinking to himself. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=450.0s)]
*  How distant this seems a year and a half ago [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=452.28s)]
*  was he's dealing with an array of indictments [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=454.52s)]
*  and legal challenges, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  the field was building up to challenge him [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=458.32s)]
*  for the Republican nomination. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=461.79999999999995s)]
*  I think he's thinking it's a worthwhile. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=463.47999999999996s)]
*  And he would think to himself, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=464.59999999999997s)]
*  the comeback's about to happen. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=465.52s)]
*  I'm hours away from returning to a place [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=466.96s)]
*  I never thought I should have left. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=469.52s)]
*  Melania's wearing a hat. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=470.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=471.76s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=472.03999999999996s)]
*  Talk to the Reverend. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=474.44s)]
*  That must be the rector, Reverend Robert Fisher, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=475.88s)]
*  who will preside over the service. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, this is a full circle moment, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  Kellyanne, for the president-elect. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  The last time he was in that church [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=485.52s)]
*  was when he was preparing to take the oath of oath [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  the first time. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=490.28s)]
*  Yes, I was there. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=491.2s)]
*  It was quite remarkable. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=491.96s)]
*  And then, of course, they went right across [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=493.4s)]
*  to have the traditional tea with President and Mrs. Obama. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=494.84s)]
*  I saw Mrs. Obama in the press recently [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=498.24s)]
*  saying that she was emotional that day [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=500.56s)]
*  because she didn't see anybody look like her up in the dais. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=502.12s)]
*  At the time, she said she was emotional [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=504.56s)]
*  because, to your point, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=506.56s)]
*  her daughters had spent half their lives there [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=508.28s)]
*  at the White House. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=510.76s)]
*  And that is emotional to say goodbye to that permanent staff [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=511.76s)]
*  who you've lived with for eight years. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=514.08s)]
*  I think this is a moment also to put aside partisanship. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=516.12s)]
*  The people who are prophylactically Biden [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=520.4s)]
*  pardoning these folks, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=522.76s)]
*  the folks preparing that lawfare document, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=524.0s)]
*  Brian, that you told us about with Doge, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=526.8s)]
*  they look small today. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=529.12s)]
*  I mean, always wrong, never Trumpers have been defunded, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=530.72s)]
*  denigrated, dismissed. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7kjcnJq8zg&t=533.6s)]
