# Ukraine's massive drone strike exposes 'vulnerable' Russia
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM)
*  Ukraine landing a massive blow against Russia as officials are expected to meet for ceasefire talks in Turkey today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=0.0s)]
*  Ukrainian drones targeting five Russian airfields at least striking at least 40 plus military aircrafts blowing them up in an assault [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=6.76s)]
*  It took more than a year to orchestrate and by the way [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=13.84s)]
*  We have reports at least two bridges are blown up joining us now from Kyiv as former US ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=17.06s)]
*  And the ambassador spent the last few nights in a bomb shelter [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=22.84s)]
*  Can you put in perspective how devastating and how how brilliant this attack was called Operation spiderweb [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=26.84s)]
*  This is a truly extraordinary operation demonstrating one how vulnerable Russia is to measures against Russian aggression in Russia itself and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  How adept the Ukrainians are at understanding and exploiting those vulnerabilities this operation is on par for you might say [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=45.8s)]
*  Williams with the Israeli operation against his bala last year truly extraordinary [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  So the Ukrainian used small FPV drones hidden inside wooden cabins [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=59.0s)]
*  Mounted on trucks when the trucks reached the targets the roofs opened up by remote control and the drones launched [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=65.64s)]
*  These are the bombers they're using to blow up these cities in Kyiv ruthlessly killing civilians and now [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=72.22s)]
*  They're they're blown up. This is amazing [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=79.28s)]
*  It's it's amazing it will reduce [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=82.88s)]
*  Ukrainian civilian casualties we know that many planes were hit [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=86.32s)]
*  We don't know the extent of the damage but a some planes are now out of action [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=90.04s)]
*  Be the Russians will have to move the planes they have farther away from the front [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=94.08s)]
*  Which means the planes they have will not be used as frequently and this is also a great strategic benefit for the United States [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=98.32s)]
*  because those planes that were destroyed to 22s to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=104.84s)]
*  95s are in fact nuclear capable planes [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=109.32s)]
*  They're used for Russian nuclear weapons which are look first and foremost targeting the United States or use [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=112.84s)]
*  Against the United States so we are more we are safer from Russian nuclear strikes as a result of Ukraine's action [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=119.2s)]
*  I hope people realize that our money's being put to great use and the fight we're doing against Russia [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=126.6s)]
*  Helps America and helps the West this costs [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=131.64s)]
*  $70,000 it did at least seven billion dollars worth of damage [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=135.38000000000002s)]
*  They are more innovative more resourceful more motivated than the Russians who throw nothing but bodies and some of which are even North Korean [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=139.46s)]
*  Bodies at this attack. So what does this do to talks today? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=146.86s)]
*  well first this is [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  undermines the false common wisdom that Russia would inevitably win this war if [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=155.86s)]
*  The West continues to arm Ukraine. Yes, and that means first and foremost the United States [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=161.34s)]
*  It doesn't have to be a gift from the United States. It can be paid for by Europeans. It could be alone [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=166.54s)]
*  Russia will not win this war and it's very much in American interest that Russia not win this war because Russia's designs are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=171.46s)]
*  Are against American interests. That's why the recent report put out by the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=178.06s)]
*  Director for National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard identified Russia as a major adversary of the United States [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=183.94s)]
*  So we need to provide the weapons to Ukraine [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=189.5s)]
*  But also the peace negotiations have gone nowhere because Putin believes that the United States will ultimately leave Ukraine in the lurch [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=192.85999999999999s)]
*  He's counting on that and that's why he is stalling [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=200.62s)]
*  That's why he's preventing President Trump from achieving the durable peace via ceasefire that President Trump definitely desperately wants [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=203.54s)]
*  So your cranes blow yesterday is a blow in favor of Russia eventually accepting [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=210.94s)]
*  Peace a peace fire a ceasefire and ambassador don't diminish what's coming out of the Senate [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=217.29999999999998s)]
*  Those are massive sanctions coming out of the Senate. It's got about least 80 senators [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=222.42s)]
*  It's veto proof and I think that to Senator Lindsey Graham is gonna be announcing something this week [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  And what you got to tell him is you 300 billion dollars of frozen funds [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  You don't come to a deal in the next month. That's gonna go right to Ukraine and that's what you tell him [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=234.7s)]
*  There is a timeline on [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=239.78s)]
*  Patience and Donald Trump took tremendous risk to give him an off-ramp and he's refusing to take it and he's gonna pay the price [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=241.86s)]
*  For that ambassador. Thanks so much for your courage being in the war zone and thanks for your insight today [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=249.62s)]
*  Thank you. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian kill me [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpkzslbijyM&t=254.82s)]
