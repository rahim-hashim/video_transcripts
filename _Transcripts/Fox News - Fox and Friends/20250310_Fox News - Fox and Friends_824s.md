# 'Resistance' Dems ramp up profanity, vandals target Tesla
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc)
*  So interesting that the liberals were so pro-Tesla and the EVs, and they wanted everyone to buy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=0.0s)]
*  them. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=6.48s)]
*  Remember, Joe Biden had mandates in place, so you had to buy a certain time period, you [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=7.48s)]
*  had to buy one. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=11.72s)]
*  And now they hate them, and they're protesting at the Tesla dealerships. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=12.72s)]
*  So apparently they don't really want to protect the environment anymore, because nothing has [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=15.84s)]
*  changed with the design of the Tesla. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=19.78s)]
*  It's just the person's politics that's running the country that's running the organization [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=22.44s)]
*  has changed. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=28.98s)]
*  I find it interesting though that they have been waiting for this fight to blow up with [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=30.82s)]
*  the cabinet. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=34.5s)]
*  I think it's totally okay. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=35.5s)]
*  The president is overseeing what Elon Musk is doing, and then you've got cabinet members [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=37.86s)]
*  that oversee their own organizations, and they have strong opinion as well. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=43.14s)]
*  So you need these guys to duke it out, and then the president to make the final decision. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=48.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=53.94s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=54.94s)]
*  Elon Musk is paying a big price with hisâ€”he's now in the middle of the fray. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=56.82s)]
*  And as he was saying over the weekend, he goes, they are doing to me what they do to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=61.9s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=65.94s)]
*  They are using the media to try to put the narrative together to make me seem like a [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=66.94s)]
*  Nazi sympathizer. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  And he says he's really concerned about people listening to this non-stop fake news about [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  him and his approach, and someone's going to try to kill him. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=78.9s)]
*  And what they're trying to do is hurt him and his businesses. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=82.66s)]
*  I mean, they're actually training, we want clear air, we don't want musky or something. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=85.3s)]
*  You idiots, it's an electric car. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  It's your best bet for clean air. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=91.74s)]
*  And now they have to worry about his charging stations. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=93.66s)]
*  Because it's all this type of Nazi stuff spray-painted on. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=96.7s)]
*  From my understanding, Brian, they have to deputize. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=101.78s)]
*  He uses a security company called Gavin the Becker, famous security organization. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  They have a lot of former military operators that work there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=110.66s)]
*  But the Trump administration, the U.S. Marshals Service, which they do sometimes, have to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=115.66s)]
*  deputize his security detail to protect him now so they can have more authority like the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=119.3s)]
*  federal government to travel with their firearms everywhere. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=124.94s)]
*  That shows you the threat. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=127.69999999999999s)]
*  Elon says it's the most American-made car out there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=129.1s)]
*  Every part of the Tesla is American-made, or the majority of it, more so than any other [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=132.74s)]
*  car, he says, in our own country. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  He's going to be live with Larry Kudlow on the Fox Business Channel today at 4 o'clock [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=140.85999999999999s)]
*  in the afternoon. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=145.98s)]
*  Yeah, I know they make a lot of great, a number of them in China too. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=146.98s)]
*  But China's got their own electric car that they made for cut rates because they don't [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=150.82s)]
*  pay their labor force anything. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=155.48s)]
*  And they're flooding Europe with that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=157.56s)]
*  We do not let them in here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=159.18s)]
*  I believe they might be in Mexico. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=160.54s)]
*  Meanwhile, where do the Democrats go from here? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=162.06s)]
*  That's the common refrain last week. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=164.18s)]
*  After, evidently, behind closed doors, Hakeem Jeffries told everyone, what you guys did [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=166.22s)]
*  on Tuesday really hurt us. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=171.7s)]
*  And the way the perception with the signs, I told you not to, and you did it anyway. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=174.38s)]
*  I'm not sure anyone listens to him, but it seems as though when asked that question by [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=178.38s)]
*  some friendly anchors, they have no answer. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=182.92s)]
*  And that's people like Ro Kahana and Alyssa Slotkin. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=186.82s)]
*  Just listen to what they've been saying and listen to how they're approaching it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=192.44s)]
*  Listen to the profanity. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=196.88s)]
*  Somebody slap me and wake me the f*** up because I'm ready to get on with it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=197.88s)]
*  If you could speak directly to Elon Musk, what would you say? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=203.26s)]
*  F*** off. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=206.2s)]
*  F*** Elon Musk. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=207.2s)]
*  Elon Musk and his hackers don't know s*** about what it means to run a housing program. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=208.2s)]
*  To think that Elon Musk or Donald Trump give a s*** about our public schools. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=216.44s)]
*  F*** Trump. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=222.0s)]
*  I don't swear in public very well, but we have to f*** Trump. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=223.0s)]
*  What are you guys doing? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=230.44s)]
*  I mean, this seems childish. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=234.24s)]
*  There's nothing about policy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  And I just remember, what was it, 10 years ago when President Trump got involved in politics, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  the narrative was a guy that uses this language. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=244.04s)]
*  We cannot elect him as the president. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=247.6s)]
*  We need decorum. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=249.44s)]
*  We need a return to normalcy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=250.44s)]
*  And then you hear these people. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=252.72s)]
*  And Brian, you were talking about the report about Hikings Jeffries. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  Apparently that didn't work because the next day during the committees, you have representatives [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=257.96s)]
*  almost being thrown out of the committees because they did not conduct themselves. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=262.32s)]
*  So I don't think he has any control of his party right now. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=265.68s)]
*  I just think it's so low class. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=269.6s)]
*  It's trashy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  It doesn't sound, where's the civility? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=272.92s)]
*  Where's our grandparents party? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  Where's our grandparents Congress? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=276.82s)]
*  Where people, they had differences, but they didn't go on national television and shout [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  things like that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=284.2s)]
*  Where's the respect? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  And at the end of the day, we're all Americans. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, they should have stood for the little boy with cancer. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=287.36s)]
*  They should have stood for the moms who lost their children or for the military or the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  young man who was accepted into the military academy at West Point and yet lost his father. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=295.64s)]
*  They should be standing for that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=302.44s)]
*  And some of the Democrats are saying we recognize that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=303.6s)]
*  We realize we handled it wrong on Tuesday when the president was addressing the joint [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=306.48s)]
*  Congress. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  That was not a good look. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=315.32s)]
*  We should have stood for the boy with cancer. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=316.52s)]
*  You stand for the president of the United States and a respect for the American people. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=319.64s)]
*  I agree with Senator Fetterman that it's really about showing our heart. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=324.56s)]
*  There's so much concern that what you saw was sort of the emotion and wanting to be [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=329.52s)]
*  visible. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=334.52s)]
*  It's not personally the way I reacted. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=335.52s)]
*  We are still finding our footing. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=337.44s)]
*  And I think you can't get better until you admit you have a problem. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=339.88s)]
*  And for me, that's one of the things that I think some of the new voices in the party [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=344.94s)]
*  have really been agitating about. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=348.36s)]
*  I think the lack of a coordinated response to the State of the Union was a mistake. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=350.12s)]
*  That's why we lost the last election because we weren't razor focused. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=354.12s)]
*  We instead focused too much time on disruptive behavior and the conduct of the Democrats. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=358.8s)]
*  That was a strategic mistake. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=364.32s)]
*  Let's not make the story about us. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  Let's make the story about what President Trump says and how we disagree with it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=368.08s)]
*  And we squandered that opportunity. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=370.8s)]
*  Tom Swazi, who's right here in Long Island, who won that seat that was vacated by Santos [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=373.0s)]
*  and he wants to be strong on the border. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=379.72s)]
*  He wants to work with Brian Fitzpatrick. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=381.8s)]
*  They want to try to get a continuing resolution passed, but they're going to have to have [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=383.8s)]
*  some compromise. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=387.2s)]
*  You know you need 60 votes in the Senate and they're talking about how they need to work [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=388.2s)]
*  together. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=392.32s)]
*  I think guys like that can. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=393.32s)]
*  But Bill Maher brought this up over the weekend. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=394.44s)]
*  He's listening to Jasmine Crockett, who came out and said, hey man, dude, this blank is [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  whack. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=401.44s)]
*  He goes, can you imagine Barack Obama saying something like that? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=402.44s)]
*  The best advertisement for Republicans and Donald Trump, and he knows it, is Jasmine [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=405.32s)]
*  Crockett, is the whole left wing, is the whole squad. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=410.0s)]
*  Because they are so way out to the left, that's who's speaking the loudest, getting [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=415.82s)]
*  the most attention, who people want to say is the Democratic Party unless they are going [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=420.38s)]
*  to stand up outside Fetterman and put them, not only put themselves up, but put them, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=425.04s)]
*  put them, cast them aside. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=430.82s)]
*  Well, it looks like they're throwing a temper tantrum every single day. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=432.42s)]
*  There has been no response to the open border crisis that was under Joe Biden that Donald [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=437.26s)]
*  Trump fixed. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=443.26s)]
*  They're standing with the criminal migrants that the president is deporting. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=444.7s)]
*  They're still saying that grown men should be able to compete against women in sports. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=448.06s)]
*  They still have this position. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=454.53999999999996s)]
*  They don't want any cuts to happen to all the waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=456.06s)]
*  They continue to argue against the process, but there's been zero response to some of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=459.82s)]
*  the programs that have been funded. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=465.14s)]
*  And so it's not just a matter of their tone and their tenor and acting trashy on TV every [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=467.02s)]
*  single day. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=472.38s)]
*  But what they stand for is not relatable at all to the public. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=473.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=477.21999999999997s)]
*  And Bernie Sanders is out there. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=478.21999999999997s)]
*  He's having these rallies in different cities with bull horns and he's standing in front [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=479.7s)]
*  of large crowds and it's called the stop oligarchy tour. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=483.7s)]
*  He was in Michigan and Wisconsin. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=487.98s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=489.7s)]
*  We're up against a phenomenon that we have never seen and that is the big lie. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=490.7s)]
*  The big lie is not just stretching the truth. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=498.21999999999997s)]
*  The big lie is not just fibbing. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=502.18s)]
*  The big lie is creating a parallel universe. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=505.58s)]
*  It is not just to push his right wing ideology. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=509.78000000000003s)]
*  What they are trying to do is deflect attention away from the real issues, the very serious [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=514.3s)]
*  issues that the working class of this country is facing. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=520.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=524.0600000000001s)]
*  I know he's got his same group of socialists. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=525.0600000000001s)]
*  But I would like to say this. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=530.58s)]
*  The best strategy, it's really easy. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=531.86s)]
*  You got to do what Joe Manchin was saying, what Federman was saying. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=533.46s)]
*  Pick the issues like what Tom Swasey talked about. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=536.38s)]
*  He's pretty thrilled with what's happening at the border. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=538.84s)]
*  But he wants comprehensive immigration reform. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=540.7800000000001s)]
*  Fine. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=543.46s)]
*  What can you deal with? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=544.6600000000001s)]
*  So you go visit Trump and say great job on the border. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=545.6600000000001s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=548.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm wondering if you could put this in. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=549.1800000000001s)]
*  Have you thought about what we're going to do with the DREAMers? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=550.4200000000001s)]
*  Have you thought about that? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=552.22s)]
*  And then you start creating a dialogue. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=553.5s)]
*  Donald Trump likes creating dialogue. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=555.34s)]
*  Guts to know people, see what's going on. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=557.0600000000001s)]
*  He has so much power in the Republican Party. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=559.1s)]
*  If he sees a way forward in some of these complex bills, including the budget, I could [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=560.9s)]
*  see him working things out, changing the frame because they know he's for and done. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=566.78s)]
*  And he does have the outside Tom Massey, who I'm not sure what he's doing. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=572.02s)]
*  Most people are listening to Trump in the Republican Party. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=576.9s)]
*  I just think the Democrats, they've forgotten that they lost the last election. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=579.94s)]
*  They speak in these absolute terms as if they won. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=584.6600000000001s)]
*  And it's like the American people want this. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=589.02s)]
*  I mean, it was like it was just two months ago where you guys lost. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=590.5s)]
*  Well, what do you stand for? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=593.38s)]
*  And you said the same thing. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=594.38s)]
*  It's like all the profanity, all just screaming against Trump. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=595.38s)]
*  What do you stand for? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=598.22s)]
*  You know, I want to know. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=599.22s)]
*  They haven't changed. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=600.54s)]
*  They haven't learned the election. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=601.54s)]
*  Everything is just anti Trump. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=603.22s)]
*  Well, the rest of the country was ready to move forward. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=604.34s)]
*  And they liked what Trump was saying about the border, about trying to drive down inflation. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=606.96s)]
*  And we saw what Joe Biden brought to the table and they supported him. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=611.66s)]
*  And then we learned over the weekend that he's using auto pen. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=614.58s)]
*  Joe Biden was using auto pen to sign his name. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=617.26s)]
*  Everything. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=619.74s)]
*  What? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=620.74s)]
*  Yes, he was using an auto pen to sign a signature. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=621.74s)]
*  Someone was using someone was using it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=624.82s)]
*  Who's in who was in charge of our government for four years? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=626.58s)]
*  But I love what Senator Kennedy said to me over the weekend. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=629.46s)]
*  He said Democrats seem determined to find out what it's like to be a Jets fan. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=632.22s)]
*  That's true. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=638.38s)]
*  Just doing the wrong thing. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=639.38s)]
*  By the way, I watched your show over the weekend and the two of us are going to be on the quiz. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=641.02s)]
*  Did you see it? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=645.98s)]
*  And it was not fair. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=647.02s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=648.34s)]
*  You gave you gave Jimmy A, B, C and D answers. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=649.34s)]
*  You asked her the most blanket questions like out of all the 50 states, which is the state [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=653.34s)]
*  that Jimmy did something in? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=658.86s)]
*  And that's like there are 50 different answers. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=660.38s)]
*  Then you gave her you said, what is the what is the his best his best comedian? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=663.14s)]
*  Like, who's his favorite comedian? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=669.9s)]
*  She's like, oh, my gosh, how many comedians are there? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=672.38s)]
*  Well, you promised me you do A, B, C and D for us. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=675.46s)]
*  The thing is, my theory with the co-host quiz is how well do you know each other? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=678.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=681.9399999999999s)]
*  So you've got to figure that he Jimmy Fela and Kennedy hang out all the time. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=682.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=686.1s)]
*  So what how would you not know who his favorite comedian is? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=686.42s)]
*  But you asked like really tough, specific questions. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=690.46s)]
*  She's trying to stack the deck for no question. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=693.98s)]
*  No, no. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=696.14s)]
*  So you feel bad and then you give her the easy questions and give me the hard questions. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=697.26s)]
*  I'm trying to help you, too. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=701.9s)]
*  I'm saying make it fair. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=703.22s)]
*  Do A, B, C and D if you're going to do multiple choice. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=704.5799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=706.74s)]
*  OK. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=707.14s)]
*  OK. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=707.5s)]
*  And make it fair. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=707.86s)]
*  Not just like which of all the 50 states, which one did he perform? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=708.62s)]
*  I'm saving this tape. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=713.2199999999999s)]
*  And Brian, if you give me harder questions as a result of this conversation, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=714.78s)]
*  I'm never doing the show. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=720.66s)]
*  Give me one week. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=721.5799999999999s)]
*  Study this study, study this woman. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=722.54s)]
*  Her moves, her nuance, everything about her. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=725.26s)]
*  So I'll say, hey, Sean, can you give me some advice on [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=728.26s)]
*  I have a cheat sheet and a mentor of like, hey, so tell me all the stuff I need to know. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=734.9s)]
*  Carly, have you ever been you've done that? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=741.18s)]
*  I did it with so much fun. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=743.18s)]
*  He give you multiple choice or was it really difficult? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=744.98s)]
*  It was a mix. It was a mix. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=747.42s)]
*  It was a mix. Actually, I don't know if there were any multiple choice. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=748.86s)]
*  I have an idea, though, because Brian, you have three other co-hosts. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=751.9s)]
*  So I propose I moderate a quiz with the four of you. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=755.42s)]
*  Do you? Absolutely. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=760.3s)]
*  I would love that. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=761.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm surprised you're OK with this. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=763.34s)]
*  You need to moderate and make sure it's fair. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=765.62s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=767.5s)]
*  I'll be the moderator and the judge. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=768.8199999999999s)]
*  And he has his he has his dry erase board and he wrote, Kennedy wins. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=771.02s)]
*  We were all laughing when we were watching it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=775.18s)]
*  So you're like, of course, we can't even read his handwriting. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=777.14s)]
*  That's great. I will say this. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=779.9s)]
*  If I do do phone a friend, the bad thing is you'd call the same person. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=782.38s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=785.8199999999999s)]
*  Sean, Sean, be the person. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=787.8199999999999s)]
*  I'd call I would call Mama Jones. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=790.3s)]
*  Oh, the one that knows you best. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=792.82s)]
*  That's smart. Amazing. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=795.82s)]
*  All right. Well, you got to watch One Nation on Sunday. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om0Fbm3EYzc&t=797.94s)]
