# The battle for free speech has become a ‘full-scale war,’ expert warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc)
*  A Brazilian Supreme Court justice is now banning Elon Musk's ex in the country and is threatening [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=0.0s)]
*  a near $9,000 fine for users trying to access the app through a VPN or virtual private network. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  It's a way to go around the ban. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=12.88s)]
*  This comes as the founder of Telegram is charged with a wide range of crimes in France in an [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  attempt to hold a top technology executive personally liable for the behavior of users [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=20.68s)]
*  on a major messaging platform. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=25.96s)]
*  It would be like locking up Mark Zuckerberg for what someone posts on Facebook. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=27.88s)]
*  So what does this mean for free speech around the globe and here at home? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=32.04s)]
*  We're asking Strive Asset Manager, co-founder and president Anson Frerichs. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=35.72s)]
*  Anson, what does it mean? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=39.44s)]
*  Is this is this a one off in places like France, in places like Brazil? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=41.56s)]
*  Or is this a sign of the times of what, you know, rulers would like to do to control what [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=46.28s)]
*  we're able to say? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  Morning, Pete. I wish this was one off, but it's not. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=54.24s)]
*  You've seen that this is a battle that's been brewing over the last couple of years and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=56.36s)]
*  now it's becoming a full scale war. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=59.8s)]
*  And this war is being really two camps. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=62.04s)]
*  It's on one side. You have these global progressive elites led by heads of states of more [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  progressive countries, but then also leaders of multinational organizations like the World [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  Economic Forum that are seeing more and more pressure on their globalist programs, asking [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=72.12s)]
*  for open borders, asking to defund the police, asking oil and gas companies to be put out of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=76.8s)]
*  business. And there's a battle between them and then everyday individual citizens that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=81.08s)]
*  frankly just want to be trusted with the truth. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=85.36s)]
*  And they've seen with their own eyes the failed policies of a lot of these organizations [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=87.96s)]
*  over the last couple of years. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=91.48s)]
*  And unfortunately, they're now speaking up. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=93.16s)]
*  They're speaking up on these open platforms, on X and on Telegram and on others. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=94.96s)]
*  And unfortunately, now their speech is trying to be suppressed by a lot of those people in [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=99.08s)]
*  power that are trying to keep the keep their agenda in place. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=102.84s)]
*  Well, Anson, you said something there on free platforms. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=106.32s)]
*  So they were talking about X, which used to be Twitter, which was bought by Elon Musk and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=108.52s)]
*  turned into a true free speech platform. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=113.08s)]
*  We're talking about Telegram, which exists not to decide what you can say, but give you a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=115.36s)]
*  secure area to say it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=119.12s)]
*  So if it's not as if these autocrats, these globalists want to ban all speech, it's just [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  the speech they can't control. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=125.88s)]
*  And it's very clear right here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=127.48s)]
*  Exactly. And I think it's very clear that if speech is legally able to be made, you [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=130.0s)]
*  should be able to say it on platforms. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=135.0s)]
*  And that's one of the things that Elon Musk, he's a big supporter of, where he says, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=136.96s)]
*  listen, I might not like you, I might not agree with you, but I'm actually going to give [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=140.16s)]
*  you a platform to say what you have to say, because at the end of the day, there's something [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=144.32s)]
*  to be said about the wisdom of crowds and the online platforms of X and Telegram and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=148.12s)]
*  others. Those are becoming sort of the places where citizens come together. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  They debate ideas. They should be doing it in the open. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=155.04s)]
*  And that's what's actually going to get us to better policies and better ideas and move [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=157.76s)]
*  the way forward. Not this idea of sort of controlling speech, controlling narrative, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=161.56s)]
*  which we saw clearly under the Biden administration. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=165.28s)]
*  Even last week, Mark Zuckerberg came out and he said, man, I need to apologize for [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  working with the government to essentially suppress the Hunter Biden story, suppress [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=171.12s)]
*  some of the covid information. It was great that Mark came out and he said that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=175.36s)]
*  So I think that's a path forward. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=178.4s)]
*  Now, hopefully it'd be great if some of the politicians actually listen to folks like [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  Mark and others and say that, hey, let's have more free speech. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=183.16s)]
*  Let's have a platform where people can talk to one another once again. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=185.44s)]
*  That's going to be better for us as citizens of this country. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=187.96s)]
*  You brought it home for us. By the way, Elon Musk posted on X about this ban in [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  Brazil saying free speech is the bedrock of democracy and an unelected pseudo judge [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=194.52s)]
*  in Brazil is destroying it for political purposes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=199.64s)]
*  They're shutting down the number one source of truth in Brazil. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=202.6s)]
*  How far away from are we one election away, the wrong president away, the wrong [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=208.44s)]
*  Supreme Court away from similar developments in our own country? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=213.16s)]
*  I mean, you mentioned what happened in the 2020 election, the pressure that was put [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=216.27999999999997s)]
*  on flat platforms. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=219.64s)]
*  Is America immune from this kind of stuff? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=221.88s)]
*  No, Pete, we're right here. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  It was just last week that Tim Walz essentially said that there is no right to free [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=226.2s)]
*  speech as it relates to misinformation. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=230.4s)]
*  But just two months ago, the New York Times and others were saying anybody that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=232.0s)]
*  questioned Joe Biden's mental acuity and ability to be president, that was [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=235.56s)]
*  misinformation just two months ago. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=239.0s)]
*  So we're at this point where this current potentially VP is saying that there is no [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  right to free speech as it relates to misinformation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  But he wants to be the one that controls what misinformation is. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=247.16s)]
*  Misinformation can be is there a border crisis going on? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=249.92s)]
*  What should we be doing about gender identity politics? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=252.92s)]
*  What should we be doing with oil and gas companies? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=255.4s)]
*  They are trying to control the narrative because they want to stay in power. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=257.64s)]
*  But unfortunately, a lot of the policies have obviously clearly failed. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=260.92s)]
*  And the only way to stay in power is now can try and control the narrative. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=264.44s)]
*  And that's what you're seeing right now. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=267.24s)]
*  Exactly right. The words misinformation and disinformation are two of the most [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=268.6s)]
*  dangerous in our lexicon and wielded by wannabe autocrats to control us all. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=272.68s)]
*  Anson, Ferrix, thank you so much. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoSy8LnX5Sc&t=278.28s)]
