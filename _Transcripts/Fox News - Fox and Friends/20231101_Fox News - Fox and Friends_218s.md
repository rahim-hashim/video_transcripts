# Iranian hackers waging sophisticated espionage campaign
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews)
*  Meanwhile, Israel now being forced to defend itself on another front. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=0.0s)]
*  Cyberspace, a leading cyber intel company, has revealed that Iranian hackers are conducting [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=3.96s)]
*  an extensive espionage campaign on Israel and other Mideast rivals that is, quote, the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=10.44s)]
*  most sophisticated and stealthy Iranian cyber attack they've ever seen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=16.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, in China, two powerhouse tech companies have removed Israel from their online maps. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=21.04s)]
*  Since there, they just don't put the name there. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=28.04s)]
*  Here to weigh in is the director at the Center for National Defense at the Heritage Foundation, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=30.32s)]
*  Robert Greenway. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  Robert, good morning to you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  Okay, so we know that Iran has been firing rockets, you know, their proxy forces over [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  the Mideast at us, and now it turns out behind the scenes we've got Iranian-based hackers [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=44.92s)]
*  trying to bring Israel's infrastructure to a standing halt. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=52.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's really the same story, two sides of the same coin. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=57.08s)]
*  They've been developing the cyber capabilities since 2015, and since really 2021 and the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=62.2s)]
*  Biden policies of appeasement, we've seen an acceleration of these attacks, not just [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=67.8s)]
*  against Israel, but against all of Israel's Arab neighbors and against the United States. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=72.5s)]
*  In May of this year, we had a report from Microsoft indicating the scope and scale of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=77.8s)]
*  attacks against the United States. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=81.64s)]
*  Last year, FBI Director Wray testified that Iran had conducted an attack against Boston [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=83.92s)]
*  Children's Hospital, and apparently that wasn't enough to elicit a U.S. response. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=88.84s)]
*  All we've done is ensure that we've paid the government, and they've got more than enough [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=93.6s)]
*  resources to launch these kinds of attacks. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=97.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=100.16s)]
*  The FBI director was talking a little bit about attacks on our infrastructure and cyber [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=101.16s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=105.16s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about, as much as you know, about Lion Tail. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=107.16000000000001s)]
*  It sounds like that's the name of the Iranian group that's trying to whack everybody. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=110.92s)]
*  So the company called Checkpoint, the report you indicated, identified Lion Tail as an [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=117.12s)]
*  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Ministry of Intelligence and Security, two arms of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  the Iranian state that have been known to conduct terrorism, assassination, and cyber [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  attacks against dissidents, against Israeli groups, and against American groups for quite [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=132.88s)]
*  some time. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  This group is the most recent, but last two years we've identified other organizations [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=138.64s)]
*  like the Mabna Institute, where Iran develops hackers for hire to conduct attacks against [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=143.56s)]
*  the U.S., Israel, and its allies. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=148.76s)]
*  And so this attack is just the most recent and the most sophisticated in a string of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  attacks against Iran's enemies. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=154.72s)]
*  And again, it grows undeterred. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=157.2s)]
*  So long as we don't respond, they'll continue. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=161.24s)]
*  So, Robert, we know that their targets are obviously infrastructure for companies, big [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  companies, big countries as well, the United States, banks. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=168.56s)]
*  Does the average person watching right now have to worry about them hacking into, you [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=173.8s)]
*  know, their Wells Fargo account? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=178.56s)]
*  Well, probably not. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=181.84s)]
*  The Iranians aren't terribly interested in individuals, with the exception of dissidents [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=182.88s)]
*  and former U.S. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=186.68s)]
*  government officials, including myself. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=187.44s)]
*  But for most people, no. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=189.76s)]
*  And banks have the resources to defend themselves. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=191.24s)]
*  The real threat is the public infrastructure and industrial control systems Iran likes [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=194.0s)]
*  to target. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=198.8s)]
*  And that could create civil disturbances and disruptions which would impact individuals, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=199.68s)]
*  but not their bank account, more like their public services and utilities. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=203.48s)]
*  So they'd turn off the lights. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=207.12s)]
*  That's a very real risk. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=210.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=212.24s)]
*  Robert, glad they didn't turn out the lights during that interview. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  Great information. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=216.0s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSdR_BDtews&t=216.84s)]
