# Expert sounds off on ‘shocking’ rise of aggression against free speech in UK, Australia
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg)
*  Misinformation legislation is taking off around the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=0.0s)]
*  Australia becoming the latest country to crack down on social media, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=3.94s)]
*  introducing a bill that could find platforms for failing to prevent, quote, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=7.92s)]
*  misinformation. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=12.72s)]
*  Could a law like that happen here under Harris? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=14.22s)]
*  Back in 2019, she made her thoughts pretty clear. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=18.26s)]
*  We will hold social media platforms accountable. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=22.72s)]
*  If you act as a megaphone for misinformation or cyber warfare, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=26.7s)]
*  if you don't police your platforms, we are going to hold you accountable as a community. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=33.1s)]
*  There has to be a responsibility that is placed on these social media sites. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  And that has to stop. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=55.379999999999995s)]
*  Our next guest has been following this from the beginning in his Twitter files probe of Brazil, Michael Schellenberger. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=57.7s)]
*  He is the CBR chair of free speech at the University of Austin, and he joins us now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=64.14s)]
*  Michael, it's great to have you back. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=68.86s)]
*  So are you surprised that censorship, even surveillance, that these issues aren't taking more of a center stage in this election? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=70.7s)]
*  Because it's very clear that from what we're seeing abroad in some of these Western countries, that it's coming here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=78.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. It's great to be with you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=87.66s)]
*  It's already been here, Michael. I apologize. It's already been here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=89.18s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. For me, it should be the number one issue, because if you do not have free speech, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=93.26s)]
*  then you cannot have free and fair elections and you don't have democracy. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=97.98s)]
*  Our country was founded on the idea that the government doesn't give us permission to have free speech. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=102.06s)]
*  Free speech is an inalienable right given to us by God, and it comes before the government. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=106.78s)]
*  So we have free speech to decide what the government is. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=111.98s)]
*  We're seeing it around the world. It's quite shocking. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=114.86s)]
*  We're seeing it in the European Union, Ireland, Brazil, Britain, and now in Australia, Canada. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=117.1s)]
*  Both Australia and Canada have taken very aggressive actions. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=123.34s)]
*  You may recall that earlier this year, the Australian government had attempted to ban [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=127.34s)]
*  not just in Australia, but around the world content that it didn't like. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=133.5s)]
*  Now we're seeing this new attack. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=138.22s)]
*  I think where this is headed is that they want to ban X in Australia and that this is the first [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=139.9s)]
*  step towards doing that. It's terrifying because they're attempting to censor us in the United [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  States, in part by getting censorship in other countries that then would ban content in the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=150.3s)]
*  United States. And as you just saw there, both Kamala Harris and her vice presidential candidate, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  Tim Walz, have both endorsed government censorship. I mean, it's shocking to say [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  government censorship of what we're allowed to say online. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=165.82s)]
*  It's really—I'm so glad you make that connection between censorship, democracy, our elections, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=170.06s)]
*  in so many ways. I just think Elon Musk, at least the state of things right now in the United States, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=175.9s)]
*  I think we'd be having a different election right now if we didn't have the freedom of X, right? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=181.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. I think it's important for people to understand that they're trying to censor [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=188.3s)]
*  X, formerly Twitter, not because there's misinformation there, but because there's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=192.46s)]
*  information there, there's truth there that governments don't want us to see. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=197.02s)]
*  One of the tells that you know that these are government people trying to censor us is that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=202.46s)]
*  they never talk about the misinformation that the governments have been putting out. The governments [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  put out misinformation about so many different things, whether it's the idea that the vaccines [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=212.70000000000002s)]
*  will prevent you from getting COVID or that it did not come from a lab. We've seen hoax after hoax [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=217.58s)]
*  from government officials spreading disinformation. They're trying to shut [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=224.54s)]
*  down the social media platforms not because they're sources of misinformation, but because [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=228.78s)]
*  they're sources of accurate information that contradicts the propaganda and the disinformation [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  that the politicians themselves and these government officials are putting out. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=238.45999999999998s)]
*  It's so true. One person's misinformation is another person's inconvenient truth, right? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=242.29999999999998s)]
*  They just don't want it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=248.14s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=249.1s)]
*  The social media has been used as a source of propaganda both to push what they want us to see [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  or keep us from seeing what they don't want us to see. So Mike, you're just such a great voice on [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=256.38s)]
*  this. You've been a fighter for freedom of speech here and abroad and I think doing a really good [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=263.02s)]
*  job of warning us that it certainly could come here in even greater form than we've seen in the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=269.5s)]
*  past, which was bad enough. Michael, thanks for joining us. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KnZqxdMOpg&t=275.58s)]
