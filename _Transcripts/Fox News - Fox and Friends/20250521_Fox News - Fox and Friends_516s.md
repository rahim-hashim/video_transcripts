# Bombshell claims surface in new book: 'Five people were running the country'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4)
*  Let's get back to what Joe Biden was doing and not doing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=0.0s)]
*  Number one, since 2014, he has not had a prostate exam, a PSA test, which requires a blood test. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=2.72s)]
*  That according to his—I don't believe anything coming out of there. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=10.72s)]
*  But now their official spokesperson said this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=13.48s)]
*  As you know, he's got devastating prostate cancer. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=15.72s)]
*  President Biden's last known PSA test, 2014. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=18.76s)]
*  Prior to Friday, President Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=22.52s)]
*  Well, if you don't test for it, how are you going to be diagnosed for it? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=26.12s)]
*  So they say there is some medical recommendation that says, after the age of 69, don't do it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=29.3s)]
*  You shouldn't really do it because they consider—because it's typically slow-growing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=36.02s)]
*  The potential benefits also have some harms. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=42.22s)]
*  And they say if sometimes false positives happen, and also the screenings include—can [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=45.82s)]
*  cause unnecessary biopsies or treatments or patient anxiety. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=52.34s)]
*  But it's a national security thing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=56.78s)]
*  Forget about Joe Biden's health. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=58.74s)]
*  If you're the president of the United States, it's national security to see if you are healthy or not. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=60.34s)]
*  How could you not take a simple blood test? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  We're treating him like he was just some other individual when he's the president of the United States. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=67.78s)]
*  And for all the people in the Democratic media or the Democrat strategists that are saying [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=73.26s)]
*  that we should not be questioning the statement here, you've been lying to us. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=78.42s)]
*  Apparently, since 2016—I'm sorry, I don't believe the statement. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=82.98s)]
*  I want to hear more evidence that you guys didn't test him until 20— [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=87.86s)]
*  He's got probably the worst doctor in America, by the way. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=91.42s)]
*  I was shocked to hear that his last PSA test was nine years ago. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=93.7s)]
*  He was the vice president then. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=97.34s)]
*  He was 72 years old. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=98.94s)]
*  I know that the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends that it's really for men 55 to 69. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=100.74s)]
*  But if there's any example, if the president of the United States, you should be tested for everything. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=106.98s)]
*  And I'm sure he is so upset right now because it's spread, it's stage four. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=112.58000000000001s)]
*  All of this could have been prevented with one blood test. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=118.66000000000001s)]
*  So I'm sure he's had blood work done over the last nine years. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=121.62s)]
*  They should just test for everything, especially if you're president. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=126.34s)]
*  So here's some of the— [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=129.1s)]
*  It's getting worse. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=129.94s)]
*  Yeah, here's some of the claims that have emerged from this book that we pretty much know are noteworthy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=130.74s)]
*  Also noteworthy that Jake Tapper in particular decided he wanted this story after he already was out of office. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=135.62s)]
*  He said five people were running the country and Joe Biden was at best the senior member of the board. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=143.06s)]
*  Who were those five people? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=147.62s)]
*  Not even cabinet members who couldn't see him over the last year. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=148.74s)]
*  They were probably Mike Donilon is remember one. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=153.3s)]
*  You have his son— [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=156.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, there's allegations that Hunter Biden was the de facto chief of staff as well. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=158.66s)]
*  But here's another quote. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=164.26s)]
*  The weekend before Hunter's trial began, Biden again offered to testify— [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=165.7s)]
*  the president of the United States offered to testify or come to court despite his packed schedule. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=169.98s)]
*  I'm sure his people said, no way are you getting on the stand to testify. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  That's why they sent Jill. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=179.5s)]
*  Yeah, we saw what he's like in public during the debate. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=180.82s)]
*  They also wrote in the book, the Biden campaign and White House operatives now had a modus operandi for attacking any journalists who covered any questions about the president's age [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=183.94s)]
*  enlisting a core of social media influencers, progressive reporters and democratic operatives to besmirch as unprofessional and biased those in the media investigating this line of inquiry. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=193.66s)]
*  Well, this— [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=205.1s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=206.02s)]
*  The one thing I'd like to bring up, number one, is that Joe Biden was bad when he took office. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=206.94s)]
*  He didn't just get bad. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=213.1s)]
*  Number one. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=214.46s)]
*  Number two, his story is not about running for reelection is who was running the country, not somebody we elected. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=215.18s)]
*  And number three is in 2020, they talked about how he couldn't get through and do one minute off the cuff into the camera. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=221.58s)]
*  A seventh grader can pick up a camera and talk about their day. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=230.3s)]
*  He couldn't do that in 2020 to the point where their professional crew said, this is all unusual. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=234.58s)]
*  It was a new stage town hall. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=240.10000000000002s)]
*  They decided that he couldn't do a real town hall. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=242.9s)]
*  So the administration got together and they did this fake town hall that they were just going to use for commercials. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=245.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, he couldn't even make it through the fake town hall that they were just going to use for commercials. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=250.7s)]
*  There's not—a town hall is supposed to be pushed back, have unbiased questions. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=254.82s)]
*  They can be supporters of yours, but it gives people, random people, the opportunity to ask the questions. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=259.3s)]
*  So in 2020, five years ago, one of the guys who wrote this book is Jake Tapper. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=264.82s)]
*  And part of the book is about the cover-up of Joe Biden's mental decline, right? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=270.98s)]
*  Five years ago, he interviewed Laura Trump and he shut down the interview because she talked about his mental decline. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=276.46000000000004s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  What we see on stage with Joe Biden, Jake, is very clearly a cognitive decline. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=285.54s)]
*  That's what I'm referring to. It makes me uncomfortable to watch somebody on stage search for questions. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=290.98s)]
*  It's so amazing to me. I think you are mocking his stutter and I think you have absolutely no standing to diagnose somebody's cognitive decline. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=296.98s)]
*  It's incredible. How do you do a book about the cover-up when you were a part of the cover-up? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=303.66s)]
*  And he said that he had called Laura Trump and apologized. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=308.22s)]
*  And he says, I'll let her characterize that opinion. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=311.06s)]
*  I also think that these guys made money. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=313.1s)]
*  This General Malley made $300,000 for the failed campaign. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=314.82s)]
*  This clown, Mike Donilon, made $4 million to get him re-elected. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=318.38s)]
*  And he said, give him the money. It's a ridiculous sum of money. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=322.86s)]
*  He still has the money and he is part of the cover-up. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=326.02s)]
*  You've got to say, the architect. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=328.82s)]
*  And if you want to know what the future of the Democratic Party is, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=330.42s)]
*  Antonio Viglorosa, who is the former mayor, is going to run for governor. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=333.06s)]
*  He called out Kamala Harris and Xavier Becerra. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=337.94s)]
*  They're all Democrats. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=340.54s)]
*  For allowing for, they say they took an oath of office and trusted to protect the American people. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=341.86s)]
*  But instead, Kamala Harris repeatedly said there was nothing wrong with Joe Biden and Becerra took a blind eye. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=348.3s)]
*  That's the future of the Democratic Party. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=353.26s)]
*  Who knew and who didn't? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=354.98s)]
*  And if you knew, you might have a scarlet letter. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  And now Jake Tapper is making money on the very thing he shut down Laura Trump for. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=360.02000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=363.94s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm all for Democrats coming on our show and coming on the program. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=364.54s)]
*  But when they continue to lie about this, you're not going to have any credibility with the audience. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=368.5s)]
*  I mean, they all just lie. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=373.14000000000004s)]
*  We bring these strategists on and these politicians on and they all say, I did not know. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=374.70000000000005s)]
*  How could you not have known? All of us saw it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=379.82s)]
*  We also wanted to share a really cute story because yesterday was Bring Your Child to Work Day at the White House. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=382.62s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, who's the press secretary, she fielded questions from the children of journalists. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=387.62s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=393.62s)]
*  How many people has he fired? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=395.62s)]
*  How many people has he fired? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=401.58s)]
*  Thus far, actually, we have not had anyone fired with the exception of one individual who did leave their job. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=407.26s)]
*  What is President Trump's favorite food? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=415.54s)]
*  Well, President Trump loves a lot of different foods, but I think his favorite is probably steak. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=418.38s)]
*  What's Donald Trump's favorite ice cream? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=424.14000000000004s)]
*  He wants to know. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=425.74s)]
*  I have seen the president eat ice cream sundaes before. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=428.90000000000003s)]
*  Raise your hand if you like ice cream sundaes. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=433.06s)]
*  What's his favorite child? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=435.66s)]
*  That is a very controversial question. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=441.18s)]
*  I am not going to answer it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=445.5s)]
*  I know he loves all of his children. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=446.90000000000003s)]
*  They're all great kids. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=449.86s)]
*  I mean, tough questions for those kids. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=452.3s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=454.66s)]
*  Another one asked, does he like to give hugs? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=455.26000000000005s)]
*  And she said, yes, I've seen him give his kids hugs, grandkids hugs and Melania hugs. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=457.94000000000005s)]
*  Someone said if he had a superpower, what would it be? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLdyVuM2sf4&t=462.02000000000004s)]
