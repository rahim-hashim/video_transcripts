# Trump Treasury secretary race becoming a 'knife fight'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54)
*  We have new Trump animation. I love it. I like it too. It's like speaking of the saints. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=0.0s)]
*  It's like glorious. It took forever to book that. Well from Saints to cabinet comes marching [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  in. President elect Donald Trump is expected to focus on filling out his economic team [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=15.8s)]
*  after making another key appointment yesterday. Bill Mollusion is live in West Palm Beach, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=20.96s)]
*  Florida. Hey Bill. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=26.32s)]
*  Ainsley, good morning to you. So obviously the economy was a huge pillar of Donald Trump's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  campaign this time around. So there's a lot of eagerness out there to find out who is [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=33.96s)]
*  he going to select as his Treasury Secretary. That's still up in the air right now, but [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=37.72s)]
*  a handful of names are being tossed out there for consideration. Take a look. According [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=42.32s)]
*  to the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, these are four of the guys they're looking [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=46.16s)]
*  at a couple of which reportedly met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in recent days. Kevin Warsh, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=49.4s)]
*  former Federal Reserve Governor, Mark Rowan, a Wall Street billionaire, Howard Lutnick, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=54.92s)]
*  the CEO of Canter Fitzgerald, and then investor Scott Besson. Now Trump did make one pick [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=59.32s)]
*  yesterday for his administration. You guys just mentioned this. He named Brendan Carr [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=66.04s)]
*  as his chairman of the FCC. Carr currently serves as the senior Republican commissioner [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=70.64s)]
*  on the FCC and in naming him, Trump said in part, quote, he will end the regulatory onslaught [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=77.16s)]
*  that has been crippling America's job creators and innovators and ensure that the FCC delivers [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=82.68s)]
*  for rural America. Now Trump made a few picks on Saturday as well. Take a look. The biggest [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=88.28s)]
*  of them was Chris Wright. He is going to serve as Trump's energy secretary. That's a big [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=93.56s)]
*  position. It oversees the stockpiles of U.S. military nuclear weapons. William Sharpe is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=97.84s)]
*  tapped to be a White House staff secretary. And then you got Caroline Levitt, who is tapped [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=104.76s)]
*  to be press secretary. She'll be sparring with the media in the coming years. She's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  27 years old. That makes her the youngest press secretary ever. As for Trump's other [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=113.56s)]
*  picks, Democrats have been throwing cold water on some of them. Take a listen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=118.64s)]
*  Is this the very best that America has to offer for a moment like this with so many [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=123.44s)]
*  challenges that we confront? Of course not. America deserves better. Republican senator [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=129.8s)]
*  who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard will be remembered [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=136.76s)]
*  by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  And guys, it was interesting. Just a short time ago this morning, the hosts of MSNBC's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=152.48s)]
*  Morning Joe program announced that they privately met face to face with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=157.32s)]
*  on Friday. They said it was their first meeting with him in seven years and that while they [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=164.08s)]
*  disagree with him on a variety of topics, they agreed to reopen lines of communication, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=169.12s)]
*  saying they don't want to just talk about Donald Trump, they want to start talking to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=174.44s)]
*  him again. We'll send it back to you. We're just hearing that too, Bill. That is probably [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=179.16s)]
*  the most magnanimous thing any individual in America has done in a long time. After [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=185.56s)]
*  all, they called him every name under the sign. For three years they called him fascist, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=190.68s)]
*  Hitler. Every day, every panel. There was nobody even to say, ever since Harold Ford [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=193.84s)]
*  left that building, there was not one person saying anything nice about Trump. And for [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=198.24s)]
*  him to take that, what is it, breakfast? It just shows you though that he does want to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  smooth things over. Maybe he is going to unite our country. And like you said earlier, everyone's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=208.44s)]
*  doing the dances out on the... Hey Bill, when Rachel Maddow shows up at Mar-a-Lago, can [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=212.88s)]
*  we make that a Fox News alert? Well, if we can get a camera down there, we'll show it [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=218.72s)]
*  to you guys live. All right, thank you very much. All right, so that's interesting. All [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=224.88s)]
*  right, well the president continues to fill out his cabinet. And I know there's a lot [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=229.88s)]
*  of high profile on like Secretary of State and National Security Advisors coming up a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=233.48s)]
*  little bit later. Keep your eye on this. It's the FCC chair and a senior Republican on the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=237.52s)]
*  He's got a great resume, first nominated back in 2017. He's going to focus on censorship, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=244.28s)]
*  focus on not censoring, but censorship, especially on the social media platforms. And what I [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  think is so significant about this, we already have the exposure thanks to Elon Musk, by [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=255.96s)]
*  Twitter. Now there's going to be a focus and all the focus is going to be on Google, on [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=261.36s)]
*  Facebook and the other behemoths and Snapchat, all the behemoths that are rising have been [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=267.64s)]
*  so dominant as well as, you know, as well as their status as a as a journalistic entity. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=272.64s)]
*  Are they going to have to give a balanced perspective when they do? Are they going to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=279.32s)]
*  have immunity from prosecution and lawsuits when they defame people? Well, he sent a letter [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  to Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Alphabet, all of the CEOs, and he's warning them for what [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=286.52s)]
*  he believes is censorship and what he's seen in the past. He said Americans have lived [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  through the unprecedented surge in censorship. Your companies played significant roles in [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=295.56s)]
*  this improper conduct. Right. And keep in mind, it's only over the last couple of years [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=300.0s)]
*  where the FCC has had some purview over social media. In addition to essentially doing battle [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=304.8s)]
*  with social media companies to try to make sure that it is a free and open place for [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=311.96s)]
*  people of all political voices to express themselves. Keep in mind, he's also going [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=318.6s)]
*  to be involved in television, which is between radio and television, two of the core jobs [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=325.04s)]
*  of the FCC. And essentially there have been a number of Republicans who over the last [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=330.48s)]
*  number of years have said that the TV networks have gotten way too liberal. They've got to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=335.68s)]
*  be back more in the middle and at least give people on the right a chance. Maybe that's [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=340.08000000000004s)]
*  why Mika and Joe went. You never know. Self preservation. Maybe so. Yeah, but I think [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=344.36s)]
*  interesting to see that when it comes to what happened at SNL, when SNL put Kamala Harris [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=350.24s)]
*  on and didn't put Trump on, what they did is they put so much heat on NBC. They say, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=357.0s)]
*  what can we do for you? And Trump said, and they said, we're going to offer you a spot [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=361.92s)]
*  on NASCAR. And he said, yes. Well, this is the guy who put the heat on. That's what I'm [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=365.8s)]
*  saying. Yeah. Blasted NBC. So it shows you they reacted and now he's got more power. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=370.2s)]
*  In the meantime, let's talk a little bit. And Bill Mollusian touched on this. We thought by [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=375.52s)]
*  now we would know who the new Treasury secretary is, who's going to sign the dollar bill. We [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=380.4s)]
*  thought it was going to be either Howard Lutnick or Scott Besant. Both of them have been on this [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=385.12s)]
*  program. But then now there are two new names. Kevin Warsh, who has been on the Federal Reserve. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=390.32s)]
*  And in fact, Trump wanted him to be the new Powell, but Powell wound up with the job and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=399.2s)]
*  he was regretful about that. Mark Rowan, a billionaire at Apollo Global. And the back story [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=405.92s)]
*  is, according to the New York Times, that apparently Howard Lutnick, screen left, who's [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=411.52s)]
*  co-chairing the transition, apparently he's getting on Trump's nerves. He's hanging around [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=417.68s)]
*  too much. And the people who talked to the Times said he's manipulating the transition to help [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=424.48s)]
*  himself. They said it's like a knife fight between those two screen left with Howard being the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=430.56s)]
*  aggressive. So now rather than pick one of those two, they're adding two more candidates. Well, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=436.88s)]
*  Scott was on with Brian. He came on our show last week and Brian interviewed him. And what's [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=442.8s)]
*  interesting is that screen right, Howard Lutnick, who's CEO at Canter Fitzgerald, he lost his [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=447.44s)]
*  brother actually in 9-11. And he is the one in charge of the transition team. And he and [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=453.84s)]
*  Linda McMahon. And they've been working on the transition team since, I think it was, was it [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=461.52s)]
*  August or was it September? We reported that the day after Trump won. But for a while they've been [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=465.2s)]
*  working on this transition team. And so he was interviewing Scott Bessett. And then I think he [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=469.67999999999995s)]
*  just said, you know what, I might want the job, right? We're right to the president. And Scott [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=473.52s)]
*  Phil is always a little bit double crossed. Obviously he was. You're interviewing me, screening me, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=477.44s)]
*  finding out what pluses and minuses and go down. I'm better. So I think Trump's in the middle of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=482.4s)]
*  it. He's going to expand it. I also heard Lighthizer, Robert Lighthizer could be somebody else, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=486.96s)]
*  a dark horse who Robert Lighthizer has this rare thing. He was saluted consistently by Chuck Schumer, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=491.35999999999996s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi and President Trump. He was unbelievable with the trade deals he pulled off. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=498.08s)]
*  Everyone focuses on China, but he did a ton of them, including redoing USMCA. So that's, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=504.08s)]
*  that's somebody to keep in mind too. So he's going to, he'll be named shortly. Also interesting, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=509.28s)]
*  Ben Carson's name's coming up again. And what is he going to do? Is he going to be HUD again? And [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=513.36s)]
*  I don't think so. Well, he said he wasn't going to, he wasn't going to be a part of the cabinet. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, no, he put out on Twitter that he will not be surgeon general, but he is apparently going to [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=521.12s)]
*  be speaking to the former and future presidents shortly about how he can help. The interesting [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=527.76s)]
*  thing about Howard Lutnick is, and this is one of the core things that Trump ran on, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  tariffs. Howard is a hundred percent behind some sort of tariff movement. Both of them are. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  Howard is, I was bigger. You think Howard's, I thought he was late to that party. I thought he was [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=547.12s)]
*  more traditional. When he was here about three weeks ago, we talked a lot about [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=552.16s)]
*  tariffs and he is completely behind them. And I was reading that both of them are for Trump's [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK97KtWqT54&t=557.9200000000001s)]
