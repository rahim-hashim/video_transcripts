# Trump meets Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince MBS: 'Historic'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs)
*  All right, let's bring in Ellie cohan. I'm served as the deputy envoy and for the same apartment during the president Trump's first term [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=0.0s)]
*  She was also on the short list to be the UN ambassador as well Ellie. Welcome to the program [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=6.28s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. Good morning [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=11.84s)]
*  Just your top thoughts of what the president is doing for his first foreign trip with the peace [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=13.68s)]
*  Aspect of this and plus obviously the economic development as well [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=19.44s)]
*  Well Lawrence, this is a historic first foreign visit for the president in his second term [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=23.12s)]
*  And I believe for President Trump and for so many of us who had the honor of serving under him [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=27.84s)]
*  There's a sense of unfinished business from the first term the president as you know left the Middle East region [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=32.88s)]
*  With peace with the Abraham Accords and if we lived in an honest world [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=38.8s)]
*  You should have received the Nobel Peace Prize for it [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=42.74s)]
*  So this is an opportunity to go back to the region [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=45.4s)]
*  Restrengthen the bilateral ties with one of our most important allies the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=48.84s)]
*  Bring prosperity to the American people because we're talking about one trillion dollars possibly of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=53.32s)]
*  Investment back to the United States and then there's also the peace part [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=59.28s)]
*  The the notion of possibly seeding the expansion of the Abraham Accords [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=64.68s)]
*  We know that the region right now with Israel and Gaza still [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=70.2s)]
*  Israel Hamas still having conflict in Gaza with Iran talks going on [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=74.68s)]
*  We know the region's not quite ready for Saudi normalization [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=79.58s)]
*  But certainly those conversations are taking place and I want to just hit on Iran real quick [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=83.3s)]
*  This gives this trip gives the president face-to-face opportunity to have very delicate conversations [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=88.82s)]
*  We know that the president is certainly giving the Iran talks a real opportunity for success [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=95.3s)]
*  But I have no doubt they're also talking about potential plan B [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=101.62s)]
*  And those are conversations against that have to take place face to face and so that's all taking place right now [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=105.3s)]
*  Oh, you're you're a refugee from Iran [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=110.78s)]
*  What do you make of Iran going to Saudi Arabia before President Trump does and what do you know about? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=113.66s)]
*  Their nuclear weapons. I watched one interview and he said a guy said they're four months away [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=120.42s)]
*  Exactly right Ainsley the Iranians and the Saudis are [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=127.1s)]
*  historical [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=131.34s)]
*  Enemies Sunni Shia rift between them [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=132.38s)]
*  Unfortunately under the Biden administration [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=136.29999999999998s)]
*  We saw China actually broker a deal between Iran and the Saudis a diplomatic return of relations between them [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  But again, this is an opportunity now with President Trump back in the White House to bring the entire region back into the American influence [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=146.66s)]
*  And distance them from China [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=153.82s)]
*  There is no trust between the Saudis and the Iranians and so I think that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=156.94s)]
*  The Saudis are in a difficult bind on the one hand [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=162.02s)]
*  They don't want to see us going to a regional war and on the other hand [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=164.9s)]
*  They certainly don't want the Iranians to have nuclear weapons capability [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=168.5s)]
*  Well, the problem is the Israelis feel kind of isolated at this moment and hopefully it's temporary [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=172.58s)]
*  communication could get reinvigorated but [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  It has to be zero enrichment. They can't you can't say well 3% 2% [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=180.62s)]
*  I'm worried about some mixed messages come from Steve Woodkoff in an interview with Sean Hannity [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=185.29999999999998s)]
*  He said we've got to make sure the enrichment is low [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=189.46s)]
*  It's got to be zero and does that worry people that sometimes there's a mixed message coming from the administration [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=191.42s)]
*  Brian, I think if you listen to the president he said it so many times [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=196.94s)]
*  He will not allow the Iranians to have nuclear weapons capability [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  He said just last week that he thinks low enrichment is not capable, but you all you have to do is increase the enrichment [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=203.94s)]
*  Yeah, but the president has said that he means business and he thinks the Iranians understand that he means business and to me that is very [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=210.62s)]
*  Clear that we're talking about full dismantling of the nuclear weapons program in Iran [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=217.78s)]
*  No centrifuges the president even said something along the lines of either we're gonna blow it up nicely or we're gonna blow it up [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=223.58s)]
*  Not nicely and we write he's talking about their nuclear [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=229.94s)]
*  Weapons program and and like the Libya model where we blow up their facilities [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=233.22s)]
*  So I don't think President Trump could be any clearer and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  And the region needs to kind of just give give him the time to go through [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=242.22s)]
*  How unpopular is the Iranian government with the Iranian people? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=247.33999999999997s)]
*  Incredibly unpopular as we've seen Brian every time the Iranian people have been given the opportunity. They've taken to the streets [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=250.94s)]
*  They've protested they put their own lives on the line. The Iranian regime has always taken very brutal crackdowns [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=257.18s)]
*  Killing over 1500 people in the last round of protests against the regime blinding others in the eyes and and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=263.74s)]
*  They commit the worst human rights abuses [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=271.02000000000004s)]
*  What? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=273.90000000000003s)]
*  Yes, they they actually shot how do they they actually have shot protesters in the eye? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=274.86s)]
*  forced, you know willingly blinding them and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=280.82000000000005s)]
*  And Ainsley they commit the worst human rights abuses to those who are wind up in political prisons in Iran [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=283.74s)]
*  So, um, this is a very brutal regime and every time the people have taken to the streets [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=289.98s)]
*  They crack down very very brutally on them [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=294.74s)]
*  But the Iranian people have shown over and again that they seek freedom they seek peace and they love America [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=297.62s)]
*  They are hoping the people want to get reunited into the nation's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=303.78s)]
*  Ellie now that we have you here we can't let you go away without comment on what's gonna happen in Turkey [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=307.74s)]
*  What do you do you see Putin come into the table? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=312.98s)]
*  Does he show up for the meeting the list gets made very clear and we may see the president United States show up [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  If there is a deal to be signed. Yeah [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=320.98s)]
*  Well, and I think that's that's the last point is exactly right if there's a deal to be signed [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=323.22s)]
*  I think the president knows these players very well his relationship with Putin now [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  We know goes back many years and he spent time now is Zelensky [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=331.74s)]
*  So I think he's got a good sense of the players and how serious they are or not [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=334.76000000000005s)]
*  I don't see the president using his own political capital to go to go to Turkey unless there is [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=339.14000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely a deal to be signed [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=345.46000000000004s)]
*  but if there is [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=346.90000000000003s)]
*  so much of that is because of the amount of time the president has invested in that process and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=348.42s)]
*  Truly if you look at the entire world we see a president who's dedicated to bringing peace to every continent [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=355.18s)]
*  But if the thing is if he shows up and everybody all the delegations are there and there's no deal done [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=360.94000000000005s)]
*  It's because Russia has impossible demands so it's on Russia and that would isolate him even more [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=366.28s)]
*  I think the president it's a no-lose situation if the other two show up and the president shows up [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=371.38s)]
*  I think he'd I think he chose that he's a part of it and he helped get them together [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=376.46s)]
*  Yeah, well with the force of his personality [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=380.0s)]
*  Yeah, he may not but if he does show up Brian to your point [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=383.64s)]
*  He's probably the only person on earth who can make a deal go through would he be able to do that though from a national security? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=386.88s)]
*  Perspective wouldn't they have to go in early his team would have to go in and make sure it's safe [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=392.24s)]
*  I think I think that they will definitely lay out all that groundwork in advance of the president going there and interestingly we see that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=396.48s)]
*  Secretary Rubio is with the president defense minister pete access [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=403.56s)]
*  So so many so many people on the president's team are with him right now and Ainsley [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=407.64s)]
*  I think they would certainly make sure that all of the the set is the stage is set for him before he would arrive [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=412.4s)]
*  Something else really interesting happened the PKK the Kurdish group that Turkey despises [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=418.76000000000005s)]
*  disbanded and I'm wondering what happened behind the scenes to make a group that [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=424.16s)]
*  Turkey does not like just suddenly disband and I'm wondering if that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=429.04s)]
*  Plays into it if they got security guarantees because the Kurds have been unbelievably loyal to Americans [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=432.68s)]
*  Yeah, they are unbelievably loyal to Americans [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=437.8s)]
*  They've been an important ally in the region as well to Israel and to other moderate states in in the entire region [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=440.44s)]
*  And so, you know, we certainly hope that the Kurds are protected in this entire process. Absolutely. Thank you so much [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=447.64000000000004s)]
*  Tim Fox News alert right now peace and trade at the top of the agenda as President Trump meets with Crown Prince [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=455.36s)]
*  MBS for a historic summit in Saudi Arabia [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=462.48s)]
*  Former Secretary of State Fox News contributor CIA director Mike Pompeo joins us now Mike your thoughts about what you've seen so far [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=466.56s)]
*  President loves the pomp and circumstance, but I understand [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=473.72s)]
*  Intentionally, he's got a lot of quality time with MBS. What do you expect them to talk about? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=476.88s)]
*  This is really important [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  I am sure they will talk about a wide wide range of things one of them will be [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  Deep connections between the US economy and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's economy. They're an important business partner [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  They're a huge producer of the energy that the world needs [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  But they'll also talk about the geopolitical challenges the challenge in the region with Israel [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=498.4s)]
*  And I'm sure it won't be far from mine that there's still a war taking place in Europe [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=502.68s)]
*  I think each of those two leaders want this resolved as quickly as possible [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=507.28s)]
*  So I'm sure that will be part of the conversation as well Brian. Do you think that? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=510.52s)]
*  Saudi Arabia wants us to play a role along with Israel to take out Iran's nuclear program with through military action [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=515.48s)]
*  Brian undoubtedly the the nations that are most at risk from the Iranian regime [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=526.48s)]
*  Aren't sitting [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=531.9200000000001s)]

*  It's the Gulf Arab states the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has had ballistic missiles land in their country directly from Iran [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=535.12s)]
*  The Houthis out of Yemen fire rockets into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia a lot [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=541.72s)]
*  No [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=546.12s)]
*  They deeply want the United States and Israel and and all rights [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=546.64s)]
*  Respecting nations all around the world to take down this regime in a way that provides security for the people that live in Riyadh [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=550.2800000000001s)]
*  And in Jeddah and all across the region [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=557.0400000000001s)]
*  Story yesterday was a Russian Iran are together trying to string out all these negotiations [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=559.76s)]
*  Because they believe this time is on their side in both situations [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=565.36s)]
*  The foreign minister of Iran met yesterday with the day before or with the time change [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=568.72s)]
*  With Saudi Arabia with MBS. So behind the scenes. Can you put this puzzle together for us? I [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=575.16s)]
*  Think so yes, that is deeply in their interest to just drag this out, right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=584.36s)]
*  You're now months into the Trump administration with only you know, dozens of months left at all time moves quickly [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=588.44s)]
*  So if you're Vladimir Putin or you're the Ayatollah or for that matter if you're Xi Jinping [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=594.0400000000001s)]
*  You're facing the most [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=599.2800000000001s)]
*  The toughest president the United States that is going to defend the United States interest everywhere and always and so delaying decisions [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=601.48s)]
*  Pushing things out creating time and space is something that's in your interest [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=608.44s)]
*  And I am confident that the three of them are all working together to make these negotiations [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=612.6400000000001s)]
*  Extend to delay so they don't have to actually do the things that the United States wants them to do [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=617.48s)]
*  How much more time do you give Iran to agree to enrich Richmond zero? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=623.12s)]
*  To dismantle their nuclear program. How much more time how many more rounds of talks or you on four rounds? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=628.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, look Brian for me the time is out [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=636.76s)]
*  There's no chance that the Iranians are going to do a full fully verifiable [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=640.08s)]
*  Denuclearization with inspections and no enrichment and destroying their missiles and missile program and then stopping terror [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=645.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean the probability of them agreeing to that Brian, you know, this it's a zero. I think the time is honest [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=652.64s)]
*  They're frankly at amongst their weakest points in an awfully long time in spite of the Biden administration not because of it [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=657.48s)]
*  The Israelis in the United States should go do everything at this moment [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=664.08s)]
*  We can to ensure that they never get a nuclear weapon and I'm confident we have the tools and skills and capabilities [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=667.6s)]
*  To pull that off and the whole world including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates all the countries in that region [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=673.0s)]
*  They'll be thankful for the work that we do [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=680.24s)]
*  Silently, they would say it publicly but behind the scenes. They'll let you know [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=682.48s)]
*  We've seen some of those cables exposed through various leaks in the background [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=686.0400000000001s)]
*  They fear what Iran in the region and lastly when you talk about the Russia and Ukraine [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=689.72s)]
*  It was a few days ago where the European leader said no ceasefire. No [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=696.4s)]
*  We're no peace talks without ceasefire [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=700.44s)]
*  Well the next day Putin comes out and says peace talks on Thursday one-on-one and Trump came in with two social and said [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=702.44s)]
*  To Zelensky take the deal. So Zelensky's going Thursday to Istanbul [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=709.44s)]
*  Has Putin been outmaneuvered? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=714.44s)]
*  I hope Putin shows up [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=716.44s)]
*  I suspect he will not without enormous pressure from the United States being applied for him to be there [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=720.44s)]
*  No doubt about it Zelensky did the right thing. He said you bet I'm in I'm happy to sit down [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=726.44s)]
*  I'll sit straight across the table from Vladimir Putin and have this conversation and I'm happy to do a ceasefire [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=731.44s)]
*  For the 30 days that gets me there [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=736.44s)]
*  President Trump is in President Zelensky is in what we've seen is that Putin has very little interest in peace [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=738.44s)]
*  Very little interest in a ceasefire. He wants to drag this on [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=744.44s)]
*  We'll see what happens in just what goodness 48 hours. But Mr. Secretary, he called the meeting [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=747.44s)]
*  He demanded the meeting he got what he wanted. How does he not show up? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=753.44s)]
*  Oh, Brian, I'll bet you've done that call the meeting once in a while didn't show he'll do what Putin does, right? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=757.44s)]
*  He'll deny he'll lie. He'll he'll evade he won't have any moral qualms about no showing the meeting [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=764.44s)]
*  He'll come up with a silly reason saying that Zelensky didn't agree to something [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=769.44s)]
*  He's trying to figure out what's in his best interest and his best interest he has concluded is not peace but continued aggression [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=772.44s)]
*  All right. We'll continue to seek your perspective on what's going on with the president's first overseas trip [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=780.44s)]
*  Especially as he moves through the Middle East. You too, Mr. Secretary. Thanks so much [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGvcRpTTccs&t=785.44s)]
