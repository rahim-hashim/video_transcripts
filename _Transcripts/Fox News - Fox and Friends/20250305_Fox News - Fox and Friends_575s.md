# 'ON HIS WAY': Hegseth gives update on fate of arrested Abbey Gate terrorist
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M)
*  Our service members won't be activists and ideologues. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=0.0s)]
*  They will be fighters and warriors. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  They will fight for our country. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=8.44s)]
*  And Pete, congratulations. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=10.96s)]
*  Secretary of Defense, congratulations. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=11.96s)]
*  And he's not big into the woke movement, I can tell you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=12.96s)]
*  I know him well. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=22.0s)]
*  I am pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=23.84s)]
*  in 15 years and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=28.72s)]
*  in the history of our services. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=35.72s)]
*  They're not supposed to be smiling and clapping. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=40.28s)]
*  That was President Trump talking about U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=43.36s)]
*  And he did it right in front of him. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=47.72s)]
*  And we just watched that together because Pete's in studio. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=49.08s)]
*  Secretary of Defense, great to see you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=52.0s)]
*  What a start you've had. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=54.2s)]
*  What did that feel like to have the president talk about the one thing you always focused on? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=55.68s)]
*  Let's build up the military. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=59.68000000000001s)]
*  Let's find out about what's going wrong with recruitment. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=60.96s)]
*  And he says there's already a difference in seven weeks. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=63.36s)]
*  Well, the brave men and women of America have stepped right up. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=65.84s)]
*  When they see who their commander in chief is, what his focus is, back to basics, war [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=67.92s)]
*  fighting standards, accountability and readiness, they're ready to raise their right hand and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=72.36s)]
*  join the U.S. military. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=76.56s)]
*  And from the Marine Corps to the Army to the Air Force to the Navy, we've seen record [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=77.76s)]
*  numbers across the country of Americans saying, I want to serve under the commander in chief, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=82.48s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=87.76s)]
*  So it was a cool moment to hear him announce that there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=88.76s)]
*  The military has responded. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=90.84s)]
*  It's a renaissance in the Pentagon, for sure. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  And it was a historic night. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  The president gave a historic, strong America first speech. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=96.48s)]
*  And it was surreal to be right in the front row watching. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  Before I go on to the issues, just for you personally, to walk down that aisle as a member [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=101.72s)]
*  of his cabinet and to sit in that front row, we all watched it and covered it the next [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=105.72s)]
*  day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=109.84s)]
*  But what was it like for you? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=110.84s)]
*  We've watched it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=112.28s)]
*  It was an honor. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=113.28s)]
*  You know, and I don't mean to deflect, but it's even more of an honor to have a front [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=114.28s)]
*  row seat to watching him be president of the United States in the Oval Office on an almost [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=117.72s)]
*  daily basis, making decisions about what we're going to focus on, what we're going to prioritize, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=121.84s)]
*  how we're going to bring peace. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=126.4s)]
*  His commitment to following through on his campaign promises is historic. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=128.44s)]
*  So nothing surprised me about what he delivered last night. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=133.04s)]
*  And I was proud to be there. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=136.04s)]
*  So you're going to go after this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=137.12s)]
*  You're going to go to the border with the vice president. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=138.88s)]
*  You're also bringing more troops to the border. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  The numbers are staggering. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=144.08s)]
*  Your thoughts about what is the mission right now? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=145.4s)]
*  Is it down to zero? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  Almost. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  Not quite to zero yet. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  97 percent drop, Brian. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=151.8s)]
*  Historic lows of crossings. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  The deterrent effect is there. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=155.96s)]
*  We've brought in the military alongside Tom Homan and Secretary Noem. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=157.52s)]
*  Look at those numbers. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=162.08s)]
*  Oh, it's 98.8 percent. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=163.08s)]
*  I mean, we're talking gotaways in the single digits, Brian. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=165.08s)]
*  President Trump gave us a charge. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=169.4s)]
*  100 percent operational control of the southern border. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=171.36s)]
*  Border security is national security. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=174.28s)]
*  Over 20 million people, as the president pointed out last night, poured in across our open [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=176.72s)]
*  border policy, which created recklessness, death, drugs for our communities. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=182.08s)]
*  We're sending those folks home and we're not letting more in. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  And you're seeing that right now. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  Are you hearing that Mexico is cracking down too because they evidently arrested 900 cartel [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=190.84s)]
*  members. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  They seem to be on the offensive on their southern border. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  Are you seeing enough cooperation? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=200.52s)]
*  I mean, my message to Mexican leaders and Mexican military leaders has been we want [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=201.8s)]
*  to cooperate with you and we will cooperate with you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  But if you don't police up the cartels on your side of the border, then we'll be forced [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  to do it for you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=212.44s)]
*  We don't want to do that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=213.44s)]
*  So right now we have historic cooperation, military to military, but we're letting them [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=214.44s)]
*  lead. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  It's their country. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  It's their fight. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  We want them to lead that fight. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  So far they have stepped up, which is a very good sign. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=224.06s)]
*  If we hear about ISIS, al-Qaeda leaders anywhere, we'll take them out. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=226.16s)]
*  If the cartels are now a terror group, we look at them as terror group, will we take [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=230.68s)]
*  them out just like they're in Yemen, just like they're in Sudan, just like they're in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=235.56s)]
*  Syria? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=239.56s)]
*  I mean, Brian, you heard the president of the United States last night, just like I [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=240.56s)]
*  did. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  They're a designated foreign terrorist organization. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  We will not accept them controlling that border, poisoning our people with fentanyl, which [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=247.0s)]
*  those numbers have not gone down enough, which is why the president has continued tariffs [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=251.28s)]
*  on Mexico. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=255.52s)]
*  So we are all options, as I've said, are on the table. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=256.64s)]
*  We would prefer that the Mexican government handle it themselves, and we hope they do. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=259.82s)]
*  And we're partnering with them to do so. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=263.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=265.12s)]
*  Let's change gears. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=266.12s)]
*  As the speech wrapped up last night, this was posted by the Chinese embassy, quote, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=267.12s)]
*  if war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war, or any other type of war, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=272.12s)]
*  we're ready to fight till the end. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  As secretary of defense, how do you take that? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=280.72s)]
*  Well, we're prepared. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  Those who long for peace must prepare for war. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=285.16s)]
*  We are we are. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=288.48s)]
*  That's why we're rebuilding our military. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=289.48s)]
*  That's why we're reestablishing deterrence and the warrior ethos is because we live in [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=291.08000000000004s)]
*  a dangerous world with powerful ascendant countries with very different ideologies. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=294.36s)]
*  You mentioned defense spending. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=299.0s)]
*  They're rapidly increasing their defense spending. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=300.66s)]
*  Modern technology. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  They want to supplant the United States. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=304.56s)]
*  If we want to deter war with the Chinese or others, we have to be strong and that president [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=306.78000000000003s)]
*  understands peace comes through strength. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  He also has a great relationship with that gentleman right there, too. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=313.32s)]
*  Xi Jinping. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=316.0s)]
*  So where we can partner, where we can cooperate to recognize that we don't want war with China, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=317.0s)]
*  we don't seek that war, we will. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=323.64s)]
*  And the president has sought historic peace and historic opportunities. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=325.44s)]
*  But my job as the secretary of defense is to make sure we're ready. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=328.36s)]
*  We need the defense spending, the capabilities, the weapons and the posture in the Indo-Pacific, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=331.8s)]
*  which is something we're very much focused on. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=336.88s)]
*  China has said they've got to up their defense spending 7.2 percent. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  And that's supposedly with a struggling economy. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  We're getting mixed messages on that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  As secretary of defense, you always want more money. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=346.44s)]
*  At the same time, Doge is in there cutting back and speeding up the systems, making it [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=348.56s)]
*  more efficient. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=354.0s)]
*  How much money are you asking for when you talk to the president or when you talk to [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=355.12s)]
*  the treasury secretary in this budget? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=359.41999999999996s)]
*  How much more do we need? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=361.94s)]
*  Because we watched it not the defense spending was not even keeping up with inflation over [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=363.28s)]
*  the last four years. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=367.84s)]
*  My message has been I'm both a fiscal hawk and a defense hawk. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=368.84s)]
*  And I think America first represents both with peace through strength. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=371.68s)]
*  So Doge is going to cut fat where we need to and we're going to reprioritize on the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=374.56s)]
*  right thing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=379.16s)]
*  So it's not about a fixed dollar amount, Brian. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=380.16s)]
*  It's about addressing the president's priorities. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=381.8s)]
*  Golden dome, southern border, modernization, hypersonics, UUVs, UAVs, the fight of the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=385.0s)]
*  future against China. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=391.52s)]
*  They know we're serious and we're building for that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=392.72s)]
*  So let's talk about the big announcement yesterday. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=395.2s)]
*  The mastermind behind the Abbey Gate bombing that injured so many and killed 13 captured [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=398.8s)]
*  is coming here. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=404.16s)]
*  Special thanks to Pakistan. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=405.48s)]
*  What could you tell us? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=406.48s)]
*  Well, special thanks to Pakistan. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=407.48s)]
*  Indeed, they cooperated with us. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=408.88s)]
*  But this started I want to be very clear under this administration. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=411.24s)]
*  We had our leadership, Director Radcliffe and others in CENTCOM and in the military [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=416.44s)]
*  passing information to the Pakistanis who helped us action it after this president was [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=423.56s)]
*  elected. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=429.24s)]
*  So this is a president who saw what happened, the debacle in Afghanistan and said, when [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=430.24s)]
*  I'm president, I will make sure those held accountable, those who perpetrated the death [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=433.72s)]
*  of 13 Americans and the injury of dozens others, we will find them. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=438.16s)]
*  We will keep our word. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=441.8s)]
*  We partnered with the Pakistanis based on intelligence we provided. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=443.38s)]
*  They nabbed him, positively identified him. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=447.04s)]
*  We've known that for a few days. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=449.36s)]
*  He's on his way, I believe, already in the United States and will face justice. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  You see, what did the Biden administration done? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=455.16s)]
*  So it happened and they wiped their hands of it and said it's the best airlift in American [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=457.8s)]
*  history. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=460.92s)]
*  We're not going to hunt these guys down. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=461.92s)]
*  President Trump never forgot and delivered at the State of the Union. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  And you're doing an investigation, your own investigation into what went into the decision [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=466.88s)]
*  to evacuate that way in Afghanistan? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=471.38s)]
*  Because, Brian, no one was held accountable. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=473.76s)]
*  It was one of the biggest disasters in American history. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=475.44s)]
*  An embarrassment, a black eye to our country. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=478.76s)]
*  We handed over billions of dollars of equipment to the Taliban. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=480.68s)]
*  We counted on them for our security and then we got people killed. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=483.44s)]
*  We gave away Bagram air base and no one in military leadership was fired? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=487.2s)]
*  No, that's not going to sail under President Trump. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=491.8s)]
*  So we're doing a full review and investigation of what happened in Afghanistan. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=494.0s)]
*  Those who were involved and made the decision to put our troops at risk will be held accountable. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=497.8s)]
*  I've stated that before and will continue to be committed to it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=501.52s)]
*  Just real quick, JD Vance was misinterpreted perhaps when he said 20,000 soldiers helping [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=504.08s)]
*  out Ukraine who haven't fought a war in 20 years is not going to be helpful. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=508.52s)]
*  And the UK said that looks like you're putting us down as fighters. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=513.44s)]
*  And that's making a lot of international news. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=518.32s)]
*  You fought with the British. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=520.52s)]
*  You have told me before you have great respect for them as fighters. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=522.28s)]
*  JD Vance is an incredible vice president. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=526.32s)]
*  He's just been fantastic. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=527.72s)]
*  And he said what I've said, which is NATO needs to step up, whether it's the French [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=529.76s)]
*  or the British or others who we've fought with in certain conflicts. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=533.52s)]
*  I have served in Afghanistan with great British soldiers. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=536.52s)]
*  The question is, will their government step up and provide that security guarantee with [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=539.48s)]
*  European troops? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=543.04s)]
*  Vice president recognizes the necessity of that, as do I, and we're hoping they will [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=544.88s)]
*  step up. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=549.08s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, I know. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=550.08s)]
*  Thanks for your first stop en route to the border. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=551.08s)]
*  The only guy, the one secretary I know that can handle early morning hours. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=553.84s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  Great to see it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=558.6800000000001s)]
*  Congratulations again. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=559.6800000000001s)]
*  Say hi to everybody in New York. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=560.6800000000001s)]
*  I know. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  And we miss you a lot, but you're doing a great job. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=562.6800000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRQ8Vpcw4M&t=566.48s)]
