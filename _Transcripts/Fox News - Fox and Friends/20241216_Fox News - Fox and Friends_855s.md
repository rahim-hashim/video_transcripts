# Biden's pardon of corrupt judge infuriates victims' families
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk)
*  President Biden under scrutiny after commuting a former Pennsylvania judge [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=0.0s)]
*  who was convicted of funneling juveniles for millions of dollars in kickbacks. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=7.8s)]
*  Her son, our next guest, was caught up in the so-called kids for cash scheme and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=14.72s)]
*  joins us right now. Sandy Fonzo is with us from Pennsylvania. Sandy, good morning [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=20.28s)]
*  to you. Good morning. Sandy, tell us a little bit about when you saw that this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=26.4s)]
*  judge who was convicted for essentially sending kids to jail longer so that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  the prison, the private facilities, could make more money. When you heard that Joe [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=42.04s)]
*  Biden pardoned this guy, commuted this guy's sentence, what did you think? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=46.8s)]
*  I was actually working so I was driving and my phone started blowing up, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=52.4s)]
*  everybody messaging me and calling me. I had no service for most of that day so [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=60.92s)]
*  it kind of just hit me. I was filled with every kind of emotion, hurt, defeat. Now [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=66.64s)]
*  that I've had more time to process it, it's more of anger and just, you know, a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=76.72s)]
*  whole, it's just very, this is very deeply upsetting and personal. It is personal [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=84.28s)]
*  because your son, this guy sentenced your son to this private prison system. The [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=90.88s)]
*  Washington Post has got an item today and they describe what was going on. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=98.72s)]
*  They write, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=103.68s)]
*  They often gave kids the harshest possible sentence. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=106.2s)]
*  Young people who were first-time offenders and probably should have [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=108.68s)]
*  received a warning or community service would end up locked up. Some were younger [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=111.6s)]
*  than 13. What the judges did caused tremendous harm to thousands of young [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  people and their families. One young man died by suicide. Many youth became [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=121.6s)]
*  depressed and dropped out of school. The one young man is your son, Eddie. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=126.6s)]
*  Eddie, explain what happened. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=132.83999999999997s)]
*  Eddie was, you know, just, he was a good kid. He was, you know, a wrestler in high [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=137.48s)]
*  school. He had his whole life ahead of him. He did nothing more than any other [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=144.88s)]
*  kids at that age do. He was at an underage drinking party and he got caught [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=152.0s)]
*  and he went in front of this judge. He was placed in our local juvenile [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=157.76s)]
*  detention center and he was there for approximately one month. And in that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=166.0s)]
*  time, you know, they, they, we, I was speaking with all of them and, you know, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=171.52s)]
*  it was to teach them a lesson, to get them back on track. And so when he came [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=176.88s)]
*  back in front of the judge, I had letters from teachers, from his wrestling [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=183.12s)]
*  coaches of my son's character. He wanted nothing more to just get back home and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=187.68s)]
*  back to his life. And that didn't happen. He was sent to this facility and, and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=194.28s)]
*  God knows what happened in that facility because when my son did come out, it [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=205.72s)]
*  was eight months at that time, I believe. He was not the same person. He was [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=211.88s)]
*  penned up with anger and bitter for all the wrong. He would not accept any kind [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=219.44s)]
*  of counseling. He, he didn't want to look you in the eye. I don't know and I can't [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=227.76s)]
*  imagine. And I try to not think about what happened to him in that facility, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=233.6s)]
*  but he never recovered from it. We were fighting this and, and, you know, these [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=238.72s)]
*  judges just had control. They had all the power and nobody could say anything. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=245.92s)]
*  Nobody could step up. I mean, there was a judge, Anne Lakouda in our courthouse. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=251.48s)]
*  And when she tried to step up, she was ousted. She was thrown out. Everybody [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=256.68s)]
*  was afraid, you know, these judges just had power. And when they shut down that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=263.2s)]
*  local, our community detention center against, you know, all the recommendations [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=268.8s)]
*  of our city board members, they started, they built their own for profit juvenile [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  detention center. And this Connahan was president judge. And when that happened, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=285.12s)]
*  he appointed Shivarella as the juvenile judge. And these kids were just funneled [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=290.64s)]
*  in and to keep these beds filled. And this went on for years and until, you [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=297.48s)]
*  know, the money was seen. That's when the feds finally stepped in and all this, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=303.32s)]
*  you know, came out. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=309.4s)]
*  Sandy, it sounds like your son should have gotten a warning or community [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=312.16s)]
*  service, but instead wound up going through the system and wound up [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=315.72s)]
*  committing suicide. You blame the judges for your child's death. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=320.36s)]
*  He ruined my son's life, my life, multiple lives. There's so many kids that have [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=326.2s)]
*  lost their life, not just my son. You know, one of the boys that was eight, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=332.68s)]
*  Charlie, that's actually in the documentary with us and went around and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=337.36s)]
*  spoke out about this. He has lost his life since. There's so many, there's so [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=341.92s)]
*  many kids that are still struggling. I've helped kids get out that got wrapped [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=347.32s)]
*  up in the system that we're in. Yeah, I mean, it's, it's just, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=353.48s)]
*  it's inexplicable. Sandy, what is your message to Joe Biden who commuted your [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=358.12s)]
*  judge's sentence? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=363.6s)]
*  Joe Biden came here and campaigned multiple, multiple times that he was, you [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=365.72s)]
*  know, Joe Scranton, he was one of us. He knew of our struggles and he cared about [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=371.8s)]
*  our community and our kids and our families. And that is just absolutely not [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=376.68s)]
*  true. He is not one of us. We have an expressway named after him. I have to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=382.52000000000004s)]
*  drive down and look at it every day. The President Biden Expressway and the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=388.72s)]
*  Biden Street. I want, that's what I want done. I mean, there needs to be reform of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=393.8s)]
*  how the overseeing of of how these applicants are chosen for these pardons. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=399.96s)]
*  And what I want to see is his name removed because that's just, you know, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=407.08s)]
*  another slap in the face, another injustice on top of all of the grief that [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=412.08s)]
*  everybody in this community has already endured. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=417.4s)]
*  Those signs are a constant reminder of a constant pain that you live with as [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=420.79999999999995s)]
*  Eddie's mother. Sandy, I know this was hard for you to tell your story, but we [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  appreciate you coming on today to tell us a little bit more about this kids for [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=428.56s)]
*  cash deal. Thank you. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=433.64s)]
*  You bet. God bless you. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=438.04s)]
*  You had a great interview, a sad story, but this is so powerful. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=440.08s)]
*  This woman was telling us, I'll let you set it up because you talked to her, but [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  her story is something everybody can relate to. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=448.8s)]
*  So many people in high school go to a party and the cops come and they bust you [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=450.84000000000003s)]
*  drinking. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=455.56s)]
*  So Sandy Fanzo joined us. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=456.72s)]
*  That is her son, Eddie. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=458.28000000000003s)]
*  Eddie was sentenced to a prison term by a judge in Pennsylvania for what Ainsley [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  was just talking about. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=467.44s)]
*  You know, this is a kid who probably should have gotten a warning or community [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=468.52000000000004s)]
*  service, but instead he wound up with essentially jail time and he wound up [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=472.32000000000005s)]
*  after that time in jail. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=477.52000000000004s)]
*  He came out a different person, as his mother just told us, and he wound up [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=480.52000000000004s)]
*  committing suicide. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=484.08000000000004s)]
*  The Washington Post has got a headline and this is the news peg here. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=485.36s)]
*  Joe Biden gave the kids for cash judge clemency. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=489.08s)]
*  That's how broken the process is. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=493.8s)]
*  And they go on to say to maximize the payout. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=495.24s)]
*  They often gave kids the harshest possible sentence. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=498.28s)]
*  Young people who were first time offenders and probably should have received a [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=500.88s)]
*  warning or community service would end up locked up somewhere younger than 13. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=503.64s)]
*  What the judges did caused tremendous harm to thousands of young people and their [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=508.91999999999996s)]
*  families. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=512.92s)]
*  One man died by suicide. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=513.52s)]
*  Many youth became depressed and dropped out of high school. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=515.76s)]
*  The young man is the son of Sandy Fonzo, who joined us in the last hour. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=519.2s)]
*  I was filled with every kind of emotion, hurt, defeat. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=526.8000000000001s)]
*  Now that I've had more time to process it, it's more of anger and just, you know, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=534.0s)]
*  whole, it's just very, this is very deeply upsetting and personal. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=542.0s)]
*  He ruined my son's life, my life, he ruined multiple lives. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=546.76s)]
*  There's so many kids that have lost their life, not just my son. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden came here and campaigned multiple, multiple times that he was, you [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=555.16s)]
*  know, Joe Scranton. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=561.16s)]
*  He was one of us. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=562.28s)]
*  He knew of our struggles and he cared about our community and our kids and our [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=563.3199999999999s)]
*  families. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=567.8399999999999s)]
*  And that is just absolutely not true. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=569.04s)]
*  He is not one of us. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=572.4799999999999s)]
*  I mean, there needs to be reform of how the overseeing of of how these applicants [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=574.3599999999999s)]
*  are chosen for these pardons. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=580.68s)]
*  So this this particular judge wound up a sentence to 17 and a half years for [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=584.28s)]
*  essentially getting kickbacks. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=589.9599999999999s)]
*  And I saw in the New York Post, the estimate is he made two million dollars in [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=591.7199999999999s)]
*  kickbacks. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=596.0s)]
*  So Joe Biden granted him clemency. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=596.76s)]
*  Remember last week when you told him, told you about how he had granted fifteen [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=599.6s)]
*  hundred acts of clemency and pardons? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=603.0s)]
*  That's the guy. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=605.88s)]
*  That is the guy that Sandy Fonzo regards as the person responsible for her son's [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=606.88s)]
*  death. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=611.88s)]
*  I'm floored by this story. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=613.52s)]
*  One of my first jobs when I became an adult was being a student advocate in the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=615.3199999999999s)]
*  juvenile justice system. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=620.52s)]
*  And the judge that I was assigned to would often give second chances to these [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=622.28s)]
*  kids, but she was a tough judge and she was tough because she used to be a school [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=626.8399999999999s)]
*  teacher and she wanted to give them a way out. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=630.8s)]
*  And when I first read about the story, I said, what would Judge Gilbert say about [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=634.4s)]
*  this? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=639.9599999999999s)]
*  She would probably say this guy's deserves to be behind bars for the rest of his [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=640.76s)]
*  life because of what he did to the judicial system. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=646.04s)]
*  It's such a responsibility. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=649.12s)]
*  It requires honor and integrity. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=651.64s)]
*  And the fact that he profited off of a criminal justice system, I think is [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=654.24s)]
*  disgraceful. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=660.36s)]
*  And to further this, when he finally got punishment to have the president of the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=662.0s)]
*  United States release him, I think is just terrible. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=667.36s)]
*  And this guy committed this young man committed suicide as a result of this [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=672.56s)]
*  judge action. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=676.56s)]
*  Yeah, there are consequences for your sons. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=677.44s)]
*  And what that man did was rob this mother of having Christmas with her with her [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=680.0s)]
*  son year after year of him being able to grow up and get married and have children [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=684.6800000000001s)]
*  of his own one day. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=689.48s)]
*  He was caught at a party where there was alcohol and the judge put him in one of [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=690.7600000000001s)]
*  these facilities. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=696.2s)]
*  It's a it's a for profit facility. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=696.96s)]
*  So if he fills up the beds, then that facility is giving him kick kickbacks. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=698.96s)]
*  I assume is how it was working. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=704.0s)]
*  The guy and his co-conspirator were made up to two point eight million dollars. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=705.4s)]
*  And the other guy is still behind bars, but this judge is is out. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=709.92s)]
*  So he gets all this money. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=714.4s)]
*  And now these kids, I mean, how long did his mom say he was in that facility? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=716.48s)]
*  Eight months and he finally got out. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=720.52s)]
*  And she said when he got out, he couldn't look her in the eye. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=723.2s)]
*  He refused to go and speak with a counselor. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=726.36s)]
*  She said, no telling what happened to my son when he was in this facility. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=728.44s)]
*  He was a changed man. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=731.9200000000001s)]
*  He was never the same. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=732.9200000000001s)]
*  And all because he was at a party where there was alcohol, that definitely should [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=734.28s)]
*  have been community service. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=737.96s)]
*  Well, I wonder if Joe Biden actually looked at the list of the people. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=739.16s)]
*  OK, what this guy do? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=742.68s)]
*  This is somebody from Pennsylvania. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=744.24s)]
*  I should look into, oh, is it? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=745.72s)]
*  Oh, he did that. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=747.24s)]
*  And he met the criteria is what they said. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=747.92s)]
*  Right. They said the sentence he demonstrated remorse and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=750.04s)]
*  rehabilitation. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=755.16s)]
*  It's not about him being rehabilitated, though. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=756.56s)]
*  It's about the harm that he is caused our justice system. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=759.24s)]
*  And this is why you need a president of the United [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=763.3199999999999s)]
*  States that is aware, that knows what's going on. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=765.04s)]
*  You can't have a staff, you know, running the White House, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=768.76s)]
*  you know, and just having this criteria. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=773.28s)]
*  But all of these offenders are connected to real people [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=775.16s)]
*  and they all have stories to tell. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=780.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, part of my job when I worked in June was to assist with these, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=782.4s)]
*  what we call divergent programs to place these kids and places to improve their lives. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=786.24s)]
*  The thought that I mean, now I'm questioning everything, you know, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=791.96s)]
*  and I know these were good people, but it makes me I can't even imagine [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=795.76s)]
*  a judge getting a gift, getting a kickback over a program [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=799.1600000000001s)]
*  that is supposed to better the life of these students. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=803.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=806.0400000000001s)]
*  Frankly, I'm surprised and I just got to be honest [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=806.6s)]
*  that the sentence was a divergent program [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=810.4s)]
*  for just being at a party where people were drinking. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=813.88s)]
*  I never had a judge that assigned someone to divergent program [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=816.36s)]
*  based on going to a party. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=819.88s)]
*  Right. Now, maybe if they were drinking or something like that, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=822.4s)]
*  they would assign them to a drug abuse program or anything. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=824.64s)]
*  But attending a party. Oh, my God. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=827.6s)]
*  That should have been a red flag to begin with. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=830.16s)]
*  And Joe Biden has released this guy. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=832.92s)]
*  Usually it's OK. You got caught doing that next Saturday. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=834.56s)]
*  You're going to go out and you're going to pick up trash for five hours. Or [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=839.4s)]
*  if it's not community service, it's like, OK, keep your nose clean [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=843.96s)]
*  for the next six months and it goes away. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=847.2s)]
*  But not that unbelievable, unbelievable. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=850.16s)]
*  It's just hard. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZsK0ub9GWk&t=853.24s)]
