# SCARED 'EVERY DAY': Owner speaks out after suspect rams her Tesla
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4)
*  The Tesla takedown protesters marching across the country yesterday during the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=0.0s)]
*  far-left's global day of action. Our next guest has been the victim of an actual [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=4.62s)]
*  attack after police in Texas arrested this suspect accused of ramming his [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=10.1s)]
*  four-wheeler into a Tesla during an unprovoked hit-and-run last week. The [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  owner of that Tesla, Vereda Kirstafan, joins us now. Vereda, good morning to you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=19.34s)]
*  I mean this was your car and this video has been seen by a whole lot of people. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=24.62s)]
*  So what is your reaction to this man hitting your car with a four-wheeler? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  I was stunned. I was upset. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=34.199999999999996s)]
*  Yeah and you were probably upset because this ended up costing you money. Tell us about that and how much damage he did. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=40.2s)]
*  He did quite a bit. I estimated so far is between $2,735. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=47.2s)]
*  Wow. So and you know, Vereda, you're one of the lucky ones here because other Teslas have been damaged even more. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=53.5s)]
*  Some people have even been arrested for setting fire to Teslas or carving swastikas or the word Nazi on them. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=64.5s)]
*  So what is your reaction to this taking place and targeting Tesla owners in their cars? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=71.5s)]
*  It was horrible. I feel like my reaction is very horrible to know that you're either shopping or eating as I was and you come out to see that your vehicle has been terrorized. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=77.8s)]
*  Yeah, I know. I hear you. And yesterday there was this global day of action and there were all these people protesting in front of Tesla dealerships. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=92.8s)]
*  Obviously this is political. So what are your thoughts on that front? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=100.8s)]
*  Well, my thoughts is that the innocent bystanders that own these vehicles shouldn't be taken by other people's feelings with politics. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=107.8s)]
*  Yeah. So it's hurting more of the innocent victims than it is the people that they're trying to hurt. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=121.8s)]
*  Vereda, are you worried about driving your Tesla in public now? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=128.8s)]
*  Every day. Every day, every second that I have to get in my vehicle, I do worry. And I do worry if I'm going to be in it when they decide to terrorize me. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=132.10000000000002s)]
*  That's so unfortunate. And you know, a Tesla isn't a cheap car. It's not. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=142.10000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Did you have to save up at all to get it? I'm sure you were proud of it when you purchased it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=148.10000000000002s)]
*  Exactly. This is my dream car. And so it's like one of my keys. I live my car just like I love my kids. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=153.4s)]
*  Yeah. And when it was when it was harmed, it really touched me some type of way. And I worked really, really hard for this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=160.4s)]
*  For somebody to do what he did is very hurtful. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=169.4s)]
*  So you're so what I'm hearing you say is that these protests are probably impacting you more than they're impacting Elon Musk. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=174.4s)]
*  They are. They're impacting all of us that own Teslas more than they are impacting on him. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  So this guy, he's been charged with felony criminal mischief, resulting in damage between $2,530,000 and failure to identify with police because he said he was a different person when police confronted him, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  which is not smart when you are this identifiable as a person. Did police follow up with you and tell you what his punishment might be if he's found guilty? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=203.0s)]
*  I haven't spoken with anyone else other than that day. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=213.0s)]
*  We'll be following it. We're so sorry that this happened to you and your car. But we thank you so much for joining us this morning to tell your story. We appreciate it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=217.0s)]
*  Thank you. I appreciate it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=225.0s)]
*  We'll be back with more of our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sq6XxVbmF4&t=232.7s)]
