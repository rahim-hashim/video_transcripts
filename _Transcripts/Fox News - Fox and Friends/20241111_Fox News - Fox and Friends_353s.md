**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE)

*  Lucas, what's the latest? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=16.6s)]
*  Well, good morning, guys. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=19.88s)]
*  While most people were asleep last night, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  President-elect Trump was announcing, as you mentioned, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  his new border czar fulfilling his mandate in the landslide election [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=25.12s)]
*  to fix the southern border. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=28.96s)]
*  Trump posting to Truth Social last night at about 11.30. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  I'll read it for you. It says, quote, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  Tom Homan will be joining the Trump administration [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=36.52s)]
*  in charge of our nation's borders. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=39.24s)]
*  The border czar. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=41.04s)]
*  There's nobody better at policing and controlling our borders. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Likewise, Tom Homan will be in charge of all deportation [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=45.36s)]
*  of illegal aliens back to their country of origin. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=48.6s)]
*  Trump also announcing his new ambassador to the United Nations, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=51.96s)]
*  New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=54.84s)]
*  whose questioning on Capitol Hill led to the ouster [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  of those two Ivy League presidents over anti-Semitic protests on campuses. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=59.279999999999994s)]
*  Trump telling the New York Post, quote, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  I am honored to nominate chairwoman Elise Stefanik [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=65.92s)]
*  to serve in my cabinet as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=68.64s)]
*  Elise is an incredibly strong, tough and smart America first fighter. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  Now, President-elect Donald Trump will be returning to the White House [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=76.72s)]
*  on Wednesday to meet with President Biden, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=79.56s)]
*  capping what many say is the greatest political comeback of all time, guys. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=82.0s)]
*  I don't know who doesn't say it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=86.44s)]
*  Lucas, thanks so much. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=88.0s)]
*  Pretty amazing, not surprising, Tom Homan's in charge. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=89.92s)]
*  I think that he said, just let's create a position, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  North and South border, let me just focus on it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=97.48s)]
*  I used to run ICE, I can run ICE, I know the border, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=99.76s)]
*  you know I know the border. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=102.64s)]
*  And it's one of those things where I think if Donald Trump [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=104.0s)]
*  can take his hands off something and let just know it's going to get done, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=106.16s)]
*  it's Tom Homan. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=109.72s)]
*  Well, and this is the part that I didn't see coming, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=110.48s)]
*  in addition to being the border czar, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=113.84s)]
*  and there's nobody better qualified than Tom Homan. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=115.44s)]
*  He has decades of experience. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=118.16s)]
*  He was a cop, he worked for ICE and he ran that and Border Patrol as well. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=119.72s)]
*  And he was a special agent for INS on top of it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=125.88s)]
*  But in addition to being the border czar, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=129.84s)]
*  he's also going to be in charge of maritime and aviation security. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=131.76s)]
*  So, you know, there's a lot of stuff from the Department of Homeland Security [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=136.4s)]
*  that will now be his purview, you know, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  because right now, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  my orcas is in charge of the TSA and stuff like that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  Are you telling me that we're going to have a border czar [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=145.16s)]
*  that actually goes to the border and knows the border? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=147.84s)]
*  I mean, this is like, this is incredible. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=151.44s)]
*  He's going to start assessing pieces of the wall, what's left. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=153.92s)]
*  Yeah, we, Brent and I were talking about the offer to Elise Stefanik. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=157.04s)]
*  It's an interesting pick, especially because the house is, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=160.88s)]
*  it's a very thin margin. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=164.12s)]
*  Right now they don't even have the margin. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=165.76s)]
*  They don't have the majority yet. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=167.12s)]
*  They don't even have the margin, we expect there to be a thin margin. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=168.28s)]
*  The way that the law works is that Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=171.12s)]
*  will have three months to make an appointment. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=175.24s)]
*  Now, that's not from the day Donald Trump takes office. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  It's actually from the day she gets confirmed. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=180.24s)]
*  So you could be looking until April for that seat to be full. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=182.72s)]
*  You know how it goes with the new administration. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  You got to ram everything through in the first hundred days. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  That's tricky. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=191.6s)]
*  I think what we're going to learn when it comes to this new Trump administration, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=192.36s)]
*  there are not going to be many surprises. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  Elise Stefanik was one of the first representatives that endorsed his campaign. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=196.72s)]
*  That was important because, Ainsley, she was a part of the leadership. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=200.2s)]
*  When others said that they were going to stay out of it, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=203.2s)]
*  she made it very clear she was standing with the president. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  The Tom Homan thing, no surprise. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=207.24s)]
*  The former president made it very clear that he was going to be a part of the border, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=209.64s)]
*  enforcing that if he got back in office. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=214.0s)]
*  And I think some of the news is coming out as well when it comes to Mike Pompeo [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=216.56s)]
*  and Nikki Haley. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  No surprises there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=220.76s)]
*  The president is making very clear that all the people that are in this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=222.2s)]
*  administration will have this agenda. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=225.24s)]
*  No loyalty to the generals, but loyalty to how he feels like the foreign policy should be. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=228.32s)]
*  Yeah, several things. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  When Tom Homan was announced, we weren't surprised because Tom Homan has always [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=236.84s)]
*  been so loyal to President Trump and cares so much about keeping our country safe. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=242.2s)]
*  And he's a tough guy. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=246.76s)]
*  And when we've talked to him in the past, what if Donald Trump wins? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  Will you go back in the administration? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=251.2s)]
*  He said, without a doubt, I will serve that man valiantly. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  It is my pleasure to do that and to keep this country safe. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=256.24s)]
*  I was talking to some Republicans who said we are happy that he will be the border czar. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=259.0s)]
*  Finally, like you said, Rachel, we'll have someone that goes to the border. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=263.24s)]
*  But also they were saying, we hope that when the deportations happen, they get out the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=266.44s)]
*  criminals first. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=271.48s)]
*  And I'm sure there will be a pecking order of who will be deported first. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=272.91999999999996s)]
*  But Tom Homan did say in the interview with Maria Bartiromo that it would be in a humane [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=276.48s)]
*  manner, which I think is fair. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  And that makes Americans, I think, overall, very happy that it's done the right way and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  done in a humane way. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=287.96s)]
*  Elise Stefanik, it's a busy job. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  You have to travel all around the world and not that you can't as a woman. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=292.0s)]
*  I'm proud of her. That would be wonderful. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  But she is a mom and there is a razor thin margin in the house. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=297.84s)]
*  So that might be something to consider. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=302.67999999999995s)]
*  It hasn't been announced by the Trump administration yet. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=305.2s)]
*  There are just some publications that are saying it has been confirmed, guys. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=307.4s)]
*  Well, so that's really important. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=310.92s)]
*  And also, I'm not sure if she's going to have the cabinet position. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=313.28s)]
*  Remember, Nikki Haley had it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=315.92s)]
*  Her replacement didn't. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=317.56s)]
*  So she said, Nikki Haley said, I'll take this if I can report directly to you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=319.64s)]
*  That's why she had so much teeth in her policies. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=322.88s)]
*  Hope Elise Stefanik asked for the same thing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=325.2s)]
*  The other thing is Tom Homan reports directly to the president. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=326.8s)]
*  No one gets ahead of him. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=329.4s)]
*  So no home and security could say, well, you have no budget or this. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=330.76s)]
*  And plus, people know about that relationship. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=334.32s)]
*  And look at this. Our bookers are the best in the business. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=336.04s)]
*  Tom Homan will be with us one hour from right now. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGOtrLJZOE&t=338.96s)]
