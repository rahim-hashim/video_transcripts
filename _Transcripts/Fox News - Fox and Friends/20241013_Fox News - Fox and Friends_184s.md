# Elon Musk is a ‘great’ businessman and cost-cutter: Donald Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY)
*  If you're not going to rely on us as the currency of choice, then you are not going to be able [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=0.0s)]
*  to do business in the United States. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=6.2s)]
*  You know what they're going to say? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=7.86s)]
*  I love the dollar very much, every single one of us, because we are losing that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  You know, China is trying to take that away from us. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=13.32s)]
*  And I'll say, by the way, I'll say the same thing to China. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=15.74s)]
*  Like I put a 27.5% tariff on cars from China. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=19.72s)]
*  So they haven't been able to pillage our country and close up our factories and lose our jobs. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Otherwise, they'd be selling cars in here like hotcakes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  And if you take a look at what they're doing to Europe, China is destroying the automobile [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=33.24s)]
*  business of Europe. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=38.64s)]
*  So I'm just trying to understand how you're going to pay for all of this no tax on stuff. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  And you said that there's a lot of fat in government that you're going to save money. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=44.0s)]
*  No, no, growth. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=46.36s)]
*  No, I said, I gave you an answer, growth. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=47.36s)]
*  Growth, yes. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=48.36s)]
*  We're going to grow at a level that you've never seen before. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=49.36s)]
*  And we're going to have tremendous jobs, and we're going to have companies coming in left [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=51.64s)]
*  and right, and they're going to be building factories. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=55.06s)]
*  They're going to take over empty hulks that are all over the place from companies that left. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=57.16s)]
*  But you've also said that there's a lot of fat in government that you would want to slid [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=61.32s)]
*  down. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=65.04s)]
*  Incredible fat. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=66.04s)]
*  So what agencies would you want to shut down? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=67.04s)]
*  Well, let me have you ask another person that because I'm going to have Elon Musk. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=68.04s)]
*  He is dying to do this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=74.2s)]
*  You know, he's a great business guy, actually. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=76.68s)]
*  You think of him for science and rockets. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=78.68s)]
*  And every time I think he's telling me about a new screw that was developed, he's developed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=80.84s)]
*  a new screw. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=85.2s)]
*  Screws are difficult, and it's made out of titanium, and it's so exciting. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=86.72s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=90.24s)]
*  He's a great business guy, and he's a great cost cutter. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=91.92s)]
*  You've seen that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=94.84s)]
*  And he said, I could cut costs without affecting anybody. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=96.4s)]
*  So he will be in the cabinet? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=99.56s)]
*  Not in the cabinet. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=100.56s)]
*  He doesn't want to be in the cabinet. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=101.56s)]
*  He just wants to be in charge of cost cutting, who have a new position, secretary of cost [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  cutting. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=109.0s)]
*  OK? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=110.0s)]
*  Elon wants to do that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=111.0s)]
*  And we have incredible people. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=112.12s)]
*  He's running a big business. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  He can't just say, oh, I think I'll go into the cabinet. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=115.2s)]
*  You know, other people can. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=117.2s)]
*  He can't. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=118.2s)]
*  But Elon's a little bit different in that sense. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=119.2s)]
*  And besides that, I want him to send the rocket up to Mars. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=121.76s)]
*  He said, he's made me a promise. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=124.2s)]
*  He'll get to Mars before the end of my administration, which will be long before, hopefully, China [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  or Russia. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=131.32s)]
*  I created Space Force. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=132.32s)]
*  First time that's been done since the Air Force. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  Air Force was the last. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=137.0s)]
*  It was 81 years ago. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=138.0s)]
*  And I did Space Force. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=140.56s)]
*  And when Biden heard, oh, he left, he thought it was so funny. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=142.4s)]
*  He didn't understand. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  And he tried to end it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  And the military went down on him. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=147.92s)]
*  You wouldn't believe it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=149.56s)]
*  It's now going to be one of our most important things. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=151.16s)]
*  We were getting killed in space by China and by Russia. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  And now we're leaving in space. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=156.6s)]
*  Coming up, just moments ago, Elon Musk's SpaceX successfully launched the Starship rocket as [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xyoar-iuY&t=158.88s)]
