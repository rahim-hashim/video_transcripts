# Greenland takes action after Trump hints at 're-ownership' of the island
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM)
*  Do you know what else you're gonna have to buy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=0.0s)]
*  for your kids? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=1.2s)]
*  Perhaps a new map of the United States of America. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=2.36s)]
*  With the great state of Canada. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  And the great state of Greenland. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=8.6s)]
*  That's right, so listen, this is what Donald Trump [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  tweeted out or posted on X back on December 22nd. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  He said, for purposes of national security and freedom [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=17.28s)]
*  throughout the world, the United States of America feels [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=20.16s)]
*  that the ownership and control of Greenland [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=23.16s)]
*  is an absolute necessity. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=25.3s)]
*  Meanwhile, Greenland's prime minister, his name is Egede, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=27.8s)]
*  is that how you say it? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=31.6s)]
*  I don't know how to speak. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=32.52s)]
*  Mutei Egege. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=33.6s)]
*  Egege, Egede? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=35.44s)]
*  Egede. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=36.68s)]
*  Egede, I don't know. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=37.52s)]
*  I'm gonna be the one person on the couch not to attempt. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=38.84s)]
*  All right, don't attempt. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=41.0s)]
*  Let's just call him the prime minister. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=41.84s)]
*  He's the prime minister. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  The prime minister said this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=43.6s)]
*  And this is what he said. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=44.42s)]
*  The Greenlandic people's opportunity for independence [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=45.260000000000005s)]
*  has been adopted through the provisions [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  of the Self-Government Act, thereby creating a legal basis [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=50.64s)]
*  for how independence can be achieved. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=54.28s)]
*  A draft constitution for our country has also been prepared. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=56.84s)]
*  Work has already begun with regard to creating [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=60.52s)]
*  the framework for Greenland as an independent state [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=63.24s)]
*  within the possibilities and provisions [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=65.72s)]
*  of Self-Government Act. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  So Donald Trump sends out this tweet. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=68.08s)]
*  At the same time, Greenland has been talking [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=70.04s)]
*  about independence from Denmark. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=71.92s)]
*  And one of the things that they've done [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=73.98s)]
*  to sort of push this forward is to put in airports [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=75.32s)]
*  so that you can come directly to Greenland [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=79.56s)]
*  without having to pass through Denmark. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=81.76s)]
*  So they've done that part. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=84.88s)]
*  But he's also, this prime minister said, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=85.72s)]
*  sorry, we don't wanna be part of the United States. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=87.88s)]
*  So what do you think is gonna happen here? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=90.44s)]
*  And what is really behind all this with Donald Trump? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=91.52s)]
*  But the important point there is that even they [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=94.0s)]
*  are not satisfied with being governed by Denmark, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=97.22s)]
*  which is kind of an important thing. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=100.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=102.92s)]
*  Do we want Greenland, guys? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=103.92s)]
*  Well, so I'm not really sure, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=105.12s)]
*  and this is a great question for your next interview [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=107.08s)]
*  with Trump, I'm not sure it's necessarily [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=109.2s)]
*  about US sovereignty over Greenland, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=111.12s)]
*  but I think US influence in the Arctic [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=113.64s)]
*  is extremely important. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=116.88s)]
*  This is strategy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=118.16s)]
*  This is major high level geopolitical strategy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=119.6s)]
*  You look at what our enemies are up to. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=122.64s)]
*  You look at the Chinese, you look at the Russians together, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=124.44s)]
*  that alliance or axis of the Chinese and the Russians, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=127.52s)]
*  they are really aggressive in the Arctic. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=130.52s)]
*  And the free world has to like wake up [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=133.04s)]
*  and pay a lot of attention to that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=135.08s)]
*  And I think that's what Trump is getting at here, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=136.68s)]
*  saying, hey, we would like to have more influence [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=138.76s)]
*  on this land mass up there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=142.28s)]
*  And who do you think can defend Greenland [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  from Russia or China more importantly, better? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=148.44s)]
*  The Danes or America? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=153.24s)]
*  America. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  And if the Danes wanna make the case for themselves, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  then they can actually put their money [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=157.36s)]
*  where their mouth is, right? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=158.8s)]
*  And if we can encourage people in the West [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  to step up on defense and that military spending [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=163.08s)]
*  and that sort of thing, all the better, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=166.24s)]
*  to help share the weight, share the burden. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=167.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=170.52s)]
*  It's similar to what he was doing in the Panama Canal. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=171.52s)]
*  100%. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=174.56s)]
*  Saying, hey, you gotta choose [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=175.4s)]
*  between whether your ally is China or the United States. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=177.28s)]
*  And so he's making very interesting moves [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  ahead of his inauguration. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcnzh7roWM&t=184.84s)]
