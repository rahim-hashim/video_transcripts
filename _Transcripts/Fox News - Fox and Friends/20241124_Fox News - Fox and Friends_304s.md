# Having children at younger age may help reduce the risk of breast cancer, study says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ)
*  A breast cancer warning you need to know about this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=0.0s)]
*  As an alarming rate or data that has been coming out [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=3.52s)]
*  reveals a growing prevalence among younger women. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  Fox News medical contributor, Dr. Nicole Sapphire [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=11.16s)]
*  lays it all out in a brand new op-ed, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=13.68s)]
*  and she joins us now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=16.32s)]
*  Nicole, good morning to you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=18.44s)]
*  So talk to us about this alarming increase [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=20.1s)]
*  in young women getting breast cancer, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=23.26s)]
*  and what are the factors that you're seeing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=25.16s)]
*  that you laid out in the op-ed? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=28.0s)]
*  Well, good morning, Rachel. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=30.2s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me on. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=31.04s)]
*  As you know, my day job is diagnosing breast cancer, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=32.16s)]
*  and my goal is to always find it [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=35.52s)]
*  as earliest and easiest to treat. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=36.92s)]
*  And one of the trends that we have been seeing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=38.72s)]
*  over the last couple of decades [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=40.6s)]
*  is a rise in breast cancer in younger women. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=42.24s)]
*  So obviously that makes us wonder what's been going on. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=44.86s)]
*  Why are we seeing more breast cancers in younger women? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=47.32s)]
*  You and I have talked about at length [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=50.24s)]
*  part of our lifestyles, the food that we're consuming, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  the sedentary life that we are leading. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  People are more overweight. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=57.16s)]
*  The chemicals we're putting on and inside of our body. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=58.58s)]
*  This is all contributing to the rise in breast cancer. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=61.26s)]
*  But there are also some other things [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=64.02s)]
*  that I point out to in the op-ed [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  that makes me pause and wonder [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=67.42s)]
*  if this is also leading to the increase. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=68.94s)]
*  And data tells me it absolutely is. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=71.14s)]
*  The fact that our US fertility rates [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=73.42s)]
*  has hit a record low in 2023, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=75.86s)]
*  down 21% over the last couple of decades. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=78.46s)]
*  When we have babies, it suppresses our estrogen [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=82.44s)]
*  or our lifetime exposure to estrogen. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=85.2s)]
*  So having babies and having them at younger ages [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=87.78s)]
*  actually decreases our risk of breast cancer. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=90.33999999999999s)]
*  Women are having babies older as well. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=92.74s)]
*  The average age of our first pregnancy is now 30 [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=94.61999999999999s)]
*  when it was 21 in 1970. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  And on top of that, Rachel, you and I have talked about [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=99.78s)]
*  people aren't breastfeeding exclusively like they used to. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  And so while this is all progress in the women's movement, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=105.34s)]
*  women are now out getting careers [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=108.61999999999999s)]
*  and they're working full time. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=110.46s)]
*  You and I are two of these women. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=111.66s)]
*  That's also causing us to not have as many babies, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=113.61999999999999s)]
*  having them older and not breastfeeding. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=116.7s)]
*  And all of this is adding to the rise in breast cancer [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=118.78s)]
*  in younger women. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=121.66s)]
*  So Nicole, for those who don't understand the connection [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=122.78s)]
*  between breastfeeding and breast cancer prevention, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=125.46000000000001s)]
*  why don't you lay that out? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=129.14000000000001s)]
*  And then I wanna talk a little bit [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=130.14000000000001s)]
*  about the fertility rates as well. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=131.62s)]
*  So all three of those things together, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=134.74s)]
*  I talked about having a baby, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=136.14000000000001s)]
*  having a baby at an older or younger age and breastfeeding. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=137.98000000000002s)]
*  All of this suppresses ovulation. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=141.34s)]
*  And if you're suppressing your ovulation, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  you're decreasing your lifetime exposure of estrogen. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=147.14s)]
*  Our lifetime exposure of estrogen, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  one of the hormones that's circulating in women's bodies, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=151.5s)]
*  that increases our risk of breast cancer. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=154.45999999999998s)]
*  It also increases our risk of other cancers as well. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=156.42s)]
*  Another thing that people don't talk about or don't realize [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=159.17999999999998s)]
*  is do you know that fat cells, our adipose cells [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=161.61999999999998s)]
*  in our body also produces estrogen, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=164.45999999999998s)]
*  which is why women who are overweight [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  and even men who are overweight [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=169.66s)]
*  have a higher risk of breast and other cancers [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=171.22s)]
*  that are directly linked to estrogen. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  We can't get rid of estrogen entirely. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=177.14s)]
*  We're women, it's just part of our natural body. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=178.94s)]
*  But decreasing our risk of breast cancer [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  and decreasing our exposure of estrogen [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=183.61999999999998s)]
*  is overall good for our health. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=186.42s)]
*  I think about birth control pills as well. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=188.38s)]
*  There's just so much more information coming out now [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=190.73999999999998s)]
*  about its impact on our bodies. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=193.29999999999998s)]
*  What do you think about a connection there? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=195.26s)]
*  Because birth control pills, as you say, also, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  are impacting people's fertility rates, clearly. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=200.98s)]
*  But also, it's something that's going into your body [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=204.58s)]
*  that's not natural. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=206.86s)]
*  Well, the data has gone back and forth [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=209.82000000000002s)]
*  when it comes to oral contraceptive pills [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=211.10000000000002s)]
*  with some evidence showing that they have a protective effect [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=213.3s)]
*  against endometrial cancer, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=216.18s)]
*  some showing that they have a slight increased risk [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=217.86s)]
*  of breast cancer. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=219.74s)]
*  A recent study came out in the last year showing that IUDs, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=221.10000000000002s)]
*  which once was thought didn't have some of those effects [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  because it wasn't an oral contraception, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=227.54000000000002s)]
*  now suggest there may be a slight increased risk [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=229.66000000000003s)]
*  of breast cancer with these contraceptive devices. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=232.22s)]
*  And anything that you're taking exogenously, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=235.54s)]
*  they do have some risk to it, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=238.94s)]
*  and those are things you need to talk to your doctor. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=240.57999999999998s)]
*  Unfortunately, in our public health sector, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=242.38s)]
*  people love to talk about the benefits, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=244.9s)]
*  but they don't really like to talk about the risks. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=246.78s)]
*  And that one life is more important than the other. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=248.66s)]
*  So we always have to make sure that we're fully transparent [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=250.94s)]
*  with the known risks. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=253.66s)]
*  Yeah, information is power. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=254.86s)]
*  And I think some of these issues, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=256.62s)]
*  they have a political component to it, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=258.38s)]
*  birth control in particular, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=261.14s)]
*  the feminist movement is definitely pro that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  And as a result of that, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=264.94s)]
*  there has been a suppression of a really good, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=266.7s)]
*  robust debate about the facts. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=269.62s)]
*  And I'm really hoping that RFK over at HHS [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=272.26s)]
*  and some of the changes that we're seeing [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=276.02s)]
*  in the administration, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=277.38s)]
*  I know you and I have talked about that before, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=278.21999999999997s)]
*  that we might be able to finally lift these taboos [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=280.02s)]
*  and start having an honest conversation [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=282.82s)]
*  because information is power, as you know, Nicole. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=289.09999999999997s)]
*  All right, thanks, Nicole. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=290.1s)]
*  Great conversation. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=291.5s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXspRNf8TtQ&t=292.34000000000003s)]
