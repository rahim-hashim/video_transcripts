*  In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPZSJiRPiUE&t=0.0s)]
*  that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPZSJiRPiUE&t=6.4s)]
*  is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous... [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPZSJiRPiUE&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  ...unaccompanied... [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPZSJiRPiUE&t=16.4s)]
*  Garbage. Garbage. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPZSJiRPiUE&t=17.6s)]
*  Another person with TDS at the highest levels. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPZSJiRPiUE&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  I mean, to be in Europe, talking junk about a president who gets up and works his ass off for this country every day, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPZSJiRPiUE&t=22.0s)]
*  and his administration is doing such great things, I mean, thank God for them. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPZSJiRPiUE&t=28.0s)]
*  But to do that in Europe, you know, what a punk move. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPZSJiRPiUE&t=31.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, this guy's got, what, 500 million, a billion dollars, you know, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPZSJiRPiUE&t=33.8s)]
*  and is out there playing like he's a working-class hero. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPZSJiRPiUE&t=39.2s)]
*  And really, to me, just wants to be, you know, in good standings with the Hollywood elite. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPZSJiRPiUE&t=42.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPZSJiRPiUE&t=46.6s)]
*  And I'm proud to say that I'm more of Hollywood's Crip tonight. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPZSJiRPiUE&t=47.0s)]
