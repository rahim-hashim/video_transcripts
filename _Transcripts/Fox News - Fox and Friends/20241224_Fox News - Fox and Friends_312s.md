# Huckabee: There will be 'hell to pay' if this doesn't happen by the inauguration
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM)
*  So as Christians traditions begin across the world Syrian church leaders are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=0.0s)]
*  advising Christians to scale back Christmas celebrations this year despite [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=5.46s)]
*  assurances from new Islamic leaders that they're going to be protected. U.S. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=9.52s)]
*  Ambassador to Israel nominee and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee joins [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  us now. Ambassador you're about to spend, excuse me, Governor you're about to spend [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=17.72s)]
*  the next four years of your life right in this tumultuous region. If you were [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=21.48s)]
*  Christian in Syria from how well you do know this region now how would you be [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=26.0s)]
*  approaching this Christmas? With a great deal of caution we don't know really [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=30.32s)]
*  what this new regime is going to do we know their history and it's not a good [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=36.2s)]
*  one. They say many wonderful things about how they're going to change and how [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  they have changed but we've heard all that before. Let's hope it's true. Let's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=44.56s)]
*  hope they've really decided they're going to be civilized people and not [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=49.04s)]
*  agents of Al Qaeda but the people who live there have to be concerned that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=52.56s)]
*  this may be like a song from the Who. Meet the new boss same as the old boss. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=58.68s)]
*  One thing is pretty clear the new boss does not does not have good relations [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  with the Russians or the Iranians which is great news. We have an opportunity to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  to kick them out of that area and stop the weapons flow as a land bridge right [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=71.72s)]
*  through that country. Israel has not stopped trying to take out the weaponry [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=77.64s)]
*  of Syria during this transition. What's their objective as you understand it? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=82.52s)]
*  Well they understand very clearly that they have to eradicate the forces that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=88.0s)]
*  would do the kind of things that they did on October the 7th and that have [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=93.64s)]
*  rained down rockets and missiles on top of their civilian population. These aren't [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=97.32s)]
*  just military actions. These are the actions of an evil, corrupt, and disgusting [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=102.16s)]
*  group of terrorists. These aren't people from forming a government. These are [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  people who would murder the most innocent among the population and do it [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  intentionally. This isn't collateral damage. This is intentional damage. There's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=119.08s)]
*  a big difference and we also have to never forget that where this comes from [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=122.88s)]
*  is from the Iranian regime. So it's imperative that systematically and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=127.24s)]
*  methodically Israel dismantle those forces that are set to take them down. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=132.76s)]
*  And they push forward in the Golan Heights because it's an ungovernable [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=137.68s)]
*  area and they cannot let that area be pushed forward with this new regime [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=141.4s)]
*  whose leader we had a ten million dollar bounty on his head which I understand [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=146.28s)]
*  we're removing and we did have a meeting on the State Department official did [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=150.72s)]
*  and he said he's somewhat pragmatic. Let's see what that means. Just so [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=155.04s)]
*  everybody knows there was 1.4 million Christians in 2011 in Syria. Now they're [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=159.72s)]
*  down to 300,000. I don't have to tell you as a pastor that Christmas and Hanukkah [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=164.45999999999998s)]
*  fall on the same time this year. It's very rare. The spiritual significance of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=170.64s)]
*  that for Christians and Jews celebrating this holiday at the same time. I think [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=175.4s)]
*  it's a wonderful opportunity. In fact in Little Rock I'm going to be lighting the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=180.76s)]
*  first candle of Hanukkah on Christmas evening. I'm very honored to be able to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=184.32s)]
*  do that. Obviously my family and I will be celebrating Christmas mostly today [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=188.16s)]
*  and of course tomorrow but also celebrating with my Jewish friends the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=192.96s)]
*  incredible holiday of Hanukkah and it's going to be a delightful experience [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=198.2s)]
*  especially in light of where God willing and the US Senate confirming I'll be [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=202.96s)]
*  headed to the middle of the Jewish state sometime in early 2025. Governor [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=208.84s)]
*  we've had our hopes up before but there's a sense with such a with Hamas [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=216.12s)]
*  suffering such devastating losses and with Gaza in tatters that they might be [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=220.52s)]
*  ready to save themselves and give up the hostages. Your source even though you're [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=226.72s)]
*  not there yet your sources are impeccable. Your thought about how much [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=230.8s)]
*  hope people should have today. I think they should have far more hope than [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=234.56s)]
*  they've had for the most of the 400 plus days that this has gone on way too long. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=239.36s)]
*  For the first time when President Trump made the comment and he said if those [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=244.8s)]
*  hostages aren't released by the time he's inaugurated on January 20th, Hamas [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=248.88s)]
*  will have held to pay and I think they understand he means business. As I've [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=253.56s)]
*  said several times we're trading Barney 5 with one bullet in his pocket for Wyatt [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=258.04s)]
*  Earp and I think Hamas understands a new sheriff is coming to town and he means [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=263.24s)]
*  business and they better let those hostages go and it's way past time. Seven [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  of them are Americans Brian this is what's so frightening and sad. Those need [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=272.68s)]
*  to be let go all of them need to be let go. You're getting an extremely important [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=277.0s)]
*  position you know that you're gonna sail right through confirmation that's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=280.88s)]
*  understood. I look forward to seeing your great work over there another great [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  challenge for Mike Huckabee and I'm sure you'll bring your guitar. Governor, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=288.64s)]
*  great to see you have a fantastic Christmas and congratulations on the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=293.4s)]
*  nomination. Thank you Brian and Merry Christmas to you and your family. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxu-0C6KrIM&t=296.88s)]
