*  What are they saying that is happening [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=55.0s)]
*  here that's concerning? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=57.16s)]
*  You know, I think a lot of a lot of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=58.4s)]
*  the issues is we hear that people [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=61.28s)]
*  are being on you know inhumane [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=63.32s)]
*  conditions, right? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  They're not being cared for well. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=65.92s)]
*  They're not receiving medical care. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=67.68s)]
*  They're not receiving legal care, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=69.2s)]
*  which is the farthest from the truth. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=70.8s)]
*  The person who ends up in this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  facility is not just that they [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=75.16s)]
*  crossed the border illegally. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=77.12s)]
*  You had to have done more than that, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=78.4s)]
*  right? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Right, so currently today as we're [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=81.28s)]
*  walking through here today, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  there's 152 detainees. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=84.68s)]
*  75% of those have been detained. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=85.64s)]
*  Have committed crimes convicted [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=88.12s)]
*  a crime or pending criminal charges. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=90.0s)]
*  So we have crimes are we talking about? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=92.64s)]
*  We unfortunately it runs the whole gamut, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=95.0s)]
*  so we have people have convicted of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=97.4s)]
*  murder, pending rape charges, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=99.88s)]
*  fentanyl distribution, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=101.84s)]
*  child porn distribution, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=102.84s)]
*  wire fraud. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=103.76s)]
*  These are the people you want in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=104.36s)]
*  ambulance. These are the people you [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=106.44s)]
*  want interacting with your kids or [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=108.56s)]
*  in your community, right? Yeah, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=110.4s)]
*  where are we at right now? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=112.28s)]
*  So this is our visitation room. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=114.0s)]
*  So we do have. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=115.92s)]
*  The option for detainees to have [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=117.88s)]
*  family come visit this is a [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=120.0s)]
*  up there you wreck sure they get [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  time out here to I just see play soccer. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=123.92s)]
*  Workout equipment, yeah, fresh air. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=127.44s)]
*  This is our medical area. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=129.24s)]
*  All all our detainees come here and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=130.76s)]
*  they give medical care right when they [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=132.88s)]
*  come in all detainees have access to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=135.04s)]
*  the law library. They set up appointments. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=137.24s)]
*  They can research their case, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=139.6s)]
*  so we're in unit two. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=141.24s)]
*  Now this is an empty unit at this moment. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=142.8s)]
*  Right now it's an empty unit, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=145.68s)]
*  but as you can see, it's it's not like [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=147.36s)]
*  a typical jail that you'd expect, right? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=149.84s)]
*  It's made out to be there behind bars. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  They're locked up, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=154.44s)]
*  but it's very spacious. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=155.36s)]
*  They have 24 access to phones. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=156.72s)]
*  Look at the what a bedroom or [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=158.72s)]
*  sleeping quarters like here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  You know this this can house eight. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=162.72s)]
*  Usually we keep six in these as [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=165.08s)]
*  we go down the halls. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=167.36s)]
*  These are. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=169.12s)]
*  Full occupied cells right now. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=170.0s)]
*  There are people sleeping on floors and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  and again they're well maintained, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=174.12s)]
*  climate controlled. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=176.0s)]
*  It's not as bad as people portraying, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=176.84s)]
*  right? I'm shocked that in everywhere [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=179.2s)]
*  I go in this prison in this facility, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=181.24s)]
*  the signs are up. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=184.04s)]
*  Do you want to return home and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=185.32s)]
*  there's a phone number? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  What happens for a detainee who says [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=188.88s)]
*  that's what I want to do? So what [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=191.12s)]
*  I will do along with customs border [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=193.48s)]
*  protection will in a safe and humane [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=195.88s)]
*  way facilitate their return home [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=198.24s)]
*  will schedule flights for them. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=199.84s)]
*  They're eligible for the $1000 stipend, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=201.56s)]
*  but they don't have cases in their hands. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=203.56s)]
*  They don't have to sit here and confinement. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=206.2s)]
*  They could leave tomorrow if they want. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=208.88s)]
*  This is a pretty nice prison. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=211.24s)]
*  Why are American prisoners not getting [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=213.16s)]
*  the same kind of care as right? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=215.16s)]
*  Well, it will hear they have to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=217.44s)]
*  make so many upgrades and retrofits [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=219.56s)]
*  just to meet our standards. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=221.52s)]
*  So financially it doesn't work for them. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=223.4s)]
*  So you have local statewide [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=229.76s)]
*  representatives, legislators who [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  are coming here concerned about [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=233.4s)]
*  the conditions for these people. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=235.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, they're not out trying [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=237.72s)]
*  to figure out why the prisons are [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=239.68s)]
*  so bad and so inhumane in their [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=242.24s)]
*  own state for American citizens. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=244.84s)]
*  You would think it'd be an outrage [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  at all these other prison facilities [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  across the country. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=252.16000000000003s)]
*  Yet Delaney Hall in Newark is now [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=253.44s)]
*  the epicenter of ICE policy in detention. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=256.0s)]
*  Alright, so as you can see easily, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=262.16s)]
*  the conditions are very good. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=264.0s)]
*  It's very unclear to me why [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  those people are out there protesting. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  They are allowed to come in. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=269.48s)]
*  ISIS said make an appointment will [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=271.44s)]
*  make it available for you to look at. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=273.44s)]
*  They have, as I said earlier, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=275.92s)]
*  nothing to hide and it was interesting [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=277.76s)]

*  they saying them off the island. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=289.2s)]
*  You know, these are not regular people [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=291.44s)]

*  I mean, the list goes on and on. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=335.04s)]
*  This should be the least of their worries. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=336.96s)]
*  And in terms of the of the lawmakers [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=339.4s)]
*  that have shown up there, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=341.68s)]
*  why are they there? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=343.36s)]
*  These are the last people that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=344.68s)]
*  need their attention. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=346.56s)]
*  These are people who committed crimes. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=348.24s)]

*  I don't know why they're doing this. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=365.36s)]
*  The facility is clean and it's housing criminals. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsD_TRMZF1E&t=366.48s)]
