**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc)
*  The Marine Corps maintained higher standards than most. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc&t=0.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc&t=2.44s)]
*  And it maintained an ethos and projected an image of we're here to be prepared to fight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc&t=3.44s)]
*  And so Americans wanted to sign up for the Marine Corps. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc&t=6.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc&t=8.92s)]
*  The Army, the Air Force, the Navy, they're doing the same thing now under President Trump. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc&t=9.92s)]
*  And Americans want to join. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc&t=13.64s)]
*  And we're raising the standards, we're making them equal, we're getting all the political [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc&t=15.14s)]
*  correct garbage out of our ranks. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc&t=18.04s)]
*  And the young men and women of America and the families of America, the military families [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc&t=20.8s)]
*  of America now feel like they can entrust their greatest treasure, which is our young [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc&t=23.92s)]
*  people into the hands of the military. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  It's an awesome responsibility for me, for the president of the United States. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc&t=30.64s)]
*  But it started the day President Trump won the election. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  They recognize the commander in chief that they believe in. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQz14nB0tXc&t=35.98s)]
