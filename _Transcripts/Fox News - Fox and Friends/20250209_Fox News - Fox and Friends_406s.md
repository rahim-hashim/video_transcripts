# 'NO SAFE HAVEN': Tom Homan warns illegal migrant gang members have nowhere to run
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw)
*  They absolutely cannot stand the illegal immigrants. I mean, they're bringing drugs, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=0.0s)]
*  they're bringing crime and all sorts of heinous acts and people are just sick of it and they're [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=4.44s)]
*  they love people like Tom Homan because they're cleaning up the city and let me just remind the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=9.28s)]
*  people that Brandon Johnson has sworn an oath to the people of Chicago that he must protect us. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=13.66s)]
*  J.B. Pritzker has sworn an oath to the people of Illinois that he will protect us and they fail to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=19.04s)]
*  do that because they're continuously telling us that they will protect the illegal immigrants here [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=24.0s)]
*  knowing that they're bringing all of the drugs and crime here in our city. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=29.36s)]
*  Fed up Chicago residents say they've had enough of far-left leaders to find President Trump's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=32.8s)]
*  border agenda by putting illegal immigrants before them. It comes as new CBP data reveals [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=39.08s)]
*  the Trump-Homan approach is working. One memo describing how 23 migrants stopped their trek [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  in Honduras after learning about the increased border security. But as borders are, Tom Homan [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=51.08s)]
*  joins us now with more. Great to see you, Zarr Homan. So, you know, one of my favorite things [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=56.8s)]
*  about this, obviously, you know, your strategy is working, the president's strategy is working, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=64.92s)]
*  but we're also getting reports that you all are not satisfied with the degree to which it's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=69.52s)]
*  working. You want it to work better and more. Well, absolutely. Look, we're in a good place, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=74.56s)]
*  but I'm not gonna be satisfied to increase the arrest in the interior. Look, just yesterday, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=80.88s)]
*  Griff, we had under 300, under 300 encounters on the southern border. And that went from, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=86.16s)]
*  you know, by administration, 11,000, remember those days, went from 11,000 to less than 300. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=92.8s)]
*  Now, I've been doing this for 34 years. I haven't seen those numbers like forever. So, you know, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  the securing the border, we get we get a great handle on that. Now, we're concentrating on [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  interior enforcement and we're doing a good we're doing good on that. But I want more. I'm not [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=108.84s)]
*  satisfied yet. We got to have more criminal arrests and the sanctuary cities are slowing us [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=113.44s)]
*  down. But we're gonna keep coming. We're gonna keep coming. And they're not gonna stop us. But [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=118.08s)]
*  it's less efficient to arrest a bad guy in the public where he's hiding from us. And we're trying [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=122.4s)]
*  to arrest him on his turf rather than arrest him in a county jail, which we should be arresting [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=127.84s)]
*  there. It takes one agent to arrest a bad guy in a county jail. It takes a whole team to find [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=132.64s)]
*  somebody that doesn't want to be found in the neighborhoods. But we're going to keep doing this [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=136.96s)]
*  until TDAs eradicate from this country. That's my number one goal. Every TDA member in this country [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=142.32s)]
*  is on notice. You either leave or we're going to find you and put you at Guantanamo Bay. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, or worse or worse in the jails in in in in Central America and El Salvador. I've seen [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=151.68s)]
*  pictures of that. That doesn't look like a fun place to go. So I hope a lot of them end up [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=158.24s)]
*  self-deporting or you guys get them. But you're right. They shouldn't be in our country. You have [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=162.48s)]
*  talked so much with me, Tom, about getting a finding, I should say, the 300,000 children [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=166.96s)]
*  that the Biden administration has lost. What kind of headway have you made on that? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  Because I know that's personal to you. It is personal. And I don't want to say an awful lot [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=178.56s)]
*  about what we're doing, because again, until we cover these leaks, we have several criminal [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=184.72s)]
*  investigations now going on, going the leaks. Those people won't find themselves in handcuffs [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=188.8s)]
*  in jail. So we're working it. We're real confident that we're going to find many of these children. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=192.96s)]
*  But as far as where we're at with that right now, I'd like to keep that close hold for now. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=199.36s)]
*  I understand. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=202.8s)]
*  Just because that is so important, so important that we don't want to we don't want to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=203.12s)]
*  say too much on national media. But as we roll this out, as you see our progress, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  we'll certainly share it with you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=213.36s)]
*  OK, Tom. So I understand that. And it's really in the law enforcement folks from HSI to ICE to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=214.8s)]
*  DEA. They're furious about these leaks. But I want to address one other thing with you, and that is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=222.72s)]
*  this sensitive location information. There are some that are withstanding the nation's desire [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=228.0s)]
*  to try and get gang members and criminal migrants out by painting a picture that you guys are [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=235.36s)]
*  planning to kick in church doors in school doors. Can you address that head on? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  You know, you and I talked about this right after the election. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=247.12s)]
*  Griff says we're going to go hardcore. We're going to go out. We want to secure that border. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=251.28s)]
*  We're going to arrest those public safety threats. We're going to prioritize them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=255.2s)]
*  And I told you the left is going to try to steal the narrative on that. They want to send [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=258.8s)]
*  false information out to the American people to make us look like we're the villains, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  The one who enforced laws to bad guys and one who broke the laws of the victims. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=267.12s)]
*  But look, the sense of the location policy, we ended that for one reason, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=270.48s)]
*  because we were the only law enforcement agency in the country that had those types of requirements. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=275.12s)]
*  FBI, DEA, they walk on colleges, campuses every day to arrest people. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=281.36s)]
*  Local police departments, they walk on a high school campus to arrest a gang member or someone [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  that had a violent criminal history. They do it every day. So what we're saying is sense of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  location policy. There's no safe haven. There's no sanctuary for a significant public safety threat [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=294.16s)]
*  or national security threat. So if we have information on an MS-13 gang member that's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=300.32s)]
*  wanted for a brutal crime and he's sitting in class at a high school, we will go in with [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=304.88s)]
*  local authorities. We'll arrest that gang member. We're not sweeping the school. We're not raiding [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=309.36s)]
*  the school. We're going to arrest one person. Every law enforcement agency has that ability. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=313.52s)]
*  I should be no different. This is about protecting the communities. Again, a message that there is no [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=318.24s)]
*  sanctuary. There is no safe haven for violent criminal or national security threats regardless [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=323.6s)]
*  where they're at. We're going to find them. We're going to arrest them, take them off the streets. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=329.44s)]
*  Imagine having your high school as a sanctuary for a Tren de Agua gang member and that you would [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=333.36s)]
*  think parents wouldn't want that. I mean, want them to be arrested? I mean, it's just unbelievable, Tom. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=341.52s)]
*  You're exactly right and that's why we're doing this. I think the American people understand that, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=349.04s)]
*  but the left are saying that we're going to raid schools and families don't want to send their [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=353.52s)]
*  children to school. It's just unfortunate. We want people to go to school. We want people to go to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=358.24s)]
*  the doctor and parents are saying they're afraid of their kids to be arrested in school. Well, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=362.32s)]
*  unless your kid is a violent gang member or a national security threat, you have no worries, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=366.08s)]
*  but if they are in that category, then you should worry because we're looking for them. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  That's right. Thank you, Tom. You're trying to protect the children in the school. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=375.44s)]
*  That's right. Tom, keep up the great work. I talked to a source down in Honduras that [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=379.04s)]
*  tells me that people are indeed turning back and group after group. So you're having an impact. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=384.24s)]
*  Keep going, my friend. Thank you. Common sense. Thank you, Tom. Thanks for having me. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8oysbPNQrw&t=389.52s)]
