# Gov. Youngkin takes action to help Milton victims: 'We're all in this together'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o)
*  Well, we've been getting an update from the state of Florida on what happened with Milton so far. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=0.0s)]
*  Somebody who knows all about hurricanes is Governor Glenn Yonkin of Virginia. You had to worry [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  about Helene just a couple of weeks ago. Yeah, we did, but let me just start that not just our [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=10.0s)]
*  prayers are with the folks in Florida, but we are supporting across the whole region with personnel, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=15.92s)]
*  not just Virginia, but a lot of states. And Governor DeSantis has led incredibly well here, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  and I just want to first recognize the first responders who rush in in order to save lives. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=27.84s)]
*  And we can't underestimate the peril that individuals are facing when a storm of this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=34.0s)]
*  magnitude blows through. We saw it in Virginia when Hurricane Helene blew through. We knew that we [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=39.68s)]
*  were going to have extraordinary water challenges. We had 70 plus water rescues. People pulled out of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  drowning circumstances. And so that team, particularly our helicopter aquatic rescue [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=51.6s)]
*  team personnel, are in Florida now. You sent National Guard. We've got 235 Virginia National [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=56.96s)]
*  Guardsmen on their way or there already. I spoke to Governor DeSantis earlier this week and said, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=64.16s)]
*  you tell us what you need and we'll get it to you. Being prepared matters. And they had a really [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=69.2s)]
*  great preparation for Helene, and I know their folks are tired, and that's why it's so important [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  that we respond to help them now. So far they're saying the theme was it was significant, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=79.92s)]
*  but it could have been a lot worse. And you were in contact with the governor of Florida, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=84.56s)]
*  and he said he saw a slight jog right before, right? Yeah, the storm, according to my conversation [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=88.88s)]
*  with Governor DeSantis, moved slightly south, and that moved it away from particularly the Tampa [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=95.2s)]
*  region. And as you've just heard, that changed the whole storm surge pattern. Now there's three [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=101.6s)]
*  million Floridians that are without power. And let me just be clear, the number one thing we have [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=106.48s)]
*  to do in a response is get the power back on. It feeds the communication systems, the water systems, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=111.44s)]
*  and then we have to clear roads and get access. And so in Virginia we had over 480 of our roads [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=117.76s)]
*  that were impassable, and we have to get the debris cleared. We have to put temporary bridges [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=125.2s)]
*  up. We had bridges out, and they're facing the same kind of challenges in Florida today. And it's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=129.52s)]
*  what we've seen with the foundation of the devastation in Georgia, South Carolina, and North [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=134.72s)]
*  Carolina as well. The response efforts have to move quickly to establish power, communications, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=139.68s)]
*  water, and transportation. So, Governor, I'm curious. You talk about the relationship. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=145.76s)]
*  How does that work? Do you call him, or does he call you and say, Governor, I need your help on this? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=149.52s)]
*  So states have an agreement called EMAC, and when we need help, we can post for help. And so a menu [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=154.8s)]
*  gets listed. I need swift water rescue teams. I need aerial rescue teams. I need truck and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=163.92s)]
*  personnel. I need general purpose teams. And then the states come together and meet those requests, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=168.64s)]
*  and we say, I'll send 235 people. Of course, Texas earlier this week said they would help, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=173.92s)]
*  and so Louisiana said they were going to help, and then they go pull down those resources from [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=179.04s)]
*  the other states as needed. They need a lot, and so this was an extensive EMAC request, and the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=183.76s)]
*  states respond appropriately. So we're all in this together, and there's moments where we have [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=189.2s)]
*  EMAC requests. In fact, we've got folks from Louisiana in Virginia today helping us with our [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=193.6s)]
*  after-emergency response, and so this is how we share expertise and make sure that we're responding [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=199.92s)]
*  as quickly as we can. Governor DeSantis said, in Florida, we run the show. FEMA's not running the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=205.76s)]
*  show. I'm the sheriff that's in charge here, and we will make sure to protect you. A lot of people [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=210.24s)]
*  are blaming FEMA for what's happening in North Carolina. What do you say? Well, just begin with [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  the fact that this is what governors are responsible for doing, is keeping our citizens safe, and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=219.44s)]
*  the initial life-saving preparation and action is led by the state, and we have to pre-position [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=224.4s)]
*  assets and send in resources, use our National Guard's capabilities, use our state police, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=231.68s)]
*  use our Department of Forestry and our VDOT, and that's what governors do. FEMA comes in afterwards, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=238.8s)]
*  and our experience in Virginia has been really good with FEMA. They've answered our requests, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=245.44s)]
*  fulfilled them, and we're getting the response. Thanks so much, Governor Yocke. Thank you, Governor. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2YcgnS8s8o&t=249.76s)]
