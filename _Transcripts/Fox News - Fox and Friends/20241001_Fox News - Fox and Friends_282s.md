# Trump admits he doesn't feel safe on the campaign trail
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A)
*  All eyes on tonight's CBS News vice presidential debate stage and its moderators who critics [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=0.0s)]
*  say have a history of anti-Donald Trump bias. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=10.36s)]
*  We know that the media seems totally uninterested in fact checking Joe Biden from any of the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=15.24s)]
*  number of false claims that he made. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I've lost track, sir. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=21.28s)]
*  I've been told the media is on every single side of this and everything's our fault. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=23.04s)]
*  But let's get back to the candidate you're here to talk about. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=26.68s)]
*  Critics also pointing out that CBS has a long record of downplaying Biden's scandals while [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  praising his administration. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=35.04s)]
*  It's a very important issue to find out whether or not a man's corrupt, who's running for [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=38.68s)]
*  president, who's accepted money from China and from Ukraine and from Russia. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=42.6s)]
*  Take a look at what's going on, Leslie. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=47.96s)]
*  And then you say that shouldn't be discussed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  I think it's this. I think it's one of the biggest scandals I've ever seen. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=53.44s)]
*  And you don't cover it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=56.8s)]
*  You want to talk about it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=58.84s)]
*  Well, because it can't be verified. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=60.040000000000006s)]
*  You want to talk about insignificant things. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=61.64s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  Of course it can be verified. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=64.68s)]
*  Excuse me. They found the laptop. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  Leslie, Leslie. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=68.12s)]
*  When I hear people say, you know, I'm going to vote for Kamala Harris because she's a [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=70.28s)]
*  black woman. She is so much more than that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=73.84s)]
*  She is so uniquely qualified to be president of this country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=76.56s)]
*  So what can we expect on the debate stage tonight here in New York City? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=81.44s)]
*  Well, here in New York City, right now we've got Fox News contributor and former [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=85.36s)]
*  senior White House counselor with Donald Trump, Kelly Anne Conway. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=88.63999999999999s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  Hi, Steve. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=92.6s)]
*  So I've heard that I've read that apparently there will be no fact checking from [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=93.96s)]
*  the moderators. So if they were going to posit some sort of bias, it would have to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  be in the form of questions and question selection. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=104.6s)]
*  We saw that also in the ABC debate in this way. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  The questions are sins of commission or omission, meaning you say flat on repeat [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=111.04s)]
*  something someone has said and you distort it for your own purposes or you don't [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=116.84s)]
*  bother to ask key questions at all. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=121.2s)]
*  The best debate moderators, Steve, are those who ask questions that mimic the way [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=123.2s)]
*  we ask ourselves questions going into that polling place and we ask each other [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  questions when we're discussing politics and presidential preferences. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=131.72s)]
*  So I think there's some pressure on these CBS moderators to be a little bit more [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=135.44s)]
*  of the way CNN was on June 27th, the way ABC was on September 10th. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=140.24s)]
*  You don't want to make yourself the issue at all. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=145.52s)]
*  But I also think these are two very volcanic personalities in walls and vans. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=147.68s)]
*  And they're probably not going to allow the debate moderators to become the stars [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=153.28s)]
*  of the show. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  Right. I was reading in this morning's New York Times that apparently J.D. Vance, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=157.12s)]
*  who's in town for the debate tonight, was over at LaBernadanne a couple of blocks [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=161.8s)]
*  up from where we're sitting right now talking to big money donors. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=166.48s)]
*  And one of the things he said about his performance tonight is he's going to go [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=170.48s)]
*  after the Harris Biden record on the border because that is their Achilles heel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=174.6s)]
*  Well, that's the key. And Kamala Harris reminded us all of her many deficits and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=180.72s)]
*  deficiencies at the border just last Friday by showing up there for a few minutes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=184.96s)]
*  People in New York and elsewhere spend more time in the Starbucks line or the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=190.56s)]
*  Chick-fil-A line than she did at the border. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=194.36s)]
*  On Friday. And then she just jetted off to California. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=196.76s)]
*  She has many weekends during her vice presidency. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=199.04s)]
*  So this is not going to rectify the fact that she has failed. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=201.76s)]
*  All the statistics I thought last week statistics from ICE were really jarring. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=206.76s)]
*  You've covered them on your show, but they're worth repeating. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=210.28s)]
*  And I hope Senator Vance does tonight. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=212.64s)]
*  We know from ICE, a government agency that Kamala Harris once likened to KKK, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=214.44s)]
*  that we have so many murderers here and rapists and convicted criminals. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=219.0s)]
*  Real quickly before you go, I want to talk a little bit about you're over on Fox [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=222.68s)]
*  Nation. You sat down with the former president among other things. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=226.0s)]
*  He said out on the trail, he does not feel safe. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=228.84s)]
*  He doesn't. I asked him that question. I said, do you feel safe? He said, no. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=231.32s)]
*  And I said, do you feel footprint? You feel differently out there? He said, yes, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=234.72s)]
*  I do. He said, it's a dangerous business and it should not be an occupational [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=237.48s)]
*  hazard for Donald Trump or anybody else running for president that you get up on [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=241.8s)]
*  that podium and you're looking around every time you get on your plane. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=245.32s)]
*  But he also made very clear, Steve, he's going to continue to barnstorm this [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=248.24s)]
*  country, regardless of how he feels about the safety, feels very compelled. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=251.52s)]
*  To get this economy back, this border more secure, get out, get us out of these [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=256.0s)]
*  wars abroad and just make people feel more secure, everyday life more affordable [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=260.28s)]
*  and more fair. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=264.24s)]
*  All right. Check it out over on Fox Nation. It's called Here's the Deal with [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=265.04s)]
*  Kellyanne. Kellyanne, thank you very much. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=268.88s)]
*  Thanks, Steve. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjOGFD0h0A&t=270.56s)]
