# Veterans sound off on support for Trump's defense secretary pick
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U)
*  Let's turn now to a panel of guests that includes Chad Robuchau, retired Marine, Mark Geist, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=0.0s)]
*  also retired Marine, and Scott Mann, former Lieutenant Colonel, Green Beret Special Forces [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=5.4s)]
*  Army. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=10.36s)]
*  Gentlemen, honored to have you with us this morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=11.36s)]
*  I think this story and the role that a new Trump administration could play, along with [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=13.52s)]
*  incoming DOD Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, tied together. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=20.48s)]
*  Chad, I'd love to start with you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=25.12s)]
*  What do you see, looking backwards at what you experienced, what you saw about Afghanistan, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=28.16s)]
*  now what's happening in Syria, and the role that a Trump, Hegseth, and others led foreign [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=32.32s)]
*  policy could mean for America? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=38.56s)]
*  I mean, we've seen it the last four years, what we all have said. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=40.68s)]
*  A strong America makes a stable world. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=46.08s)]
*  A weak America, a weak White House, a weak Secretary of Defense makes a chaotic world, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=48.72s)]
*  and that's what we have seen and witnessed. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  You know, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth would be a phenomenal choice for several reasons. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=56.16s)]
*  One is that he comes outside of the institution. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=61.8s)]
*  Our most vulnerable part of American national security right now is not our military strategic [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  capability. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  It's the fact that we have a lowest morale recruiting and retention in 30 years. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  Those are three areas that I believe that need to be rectified. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=75.4s)]
*  It has to come from someone outside the institution. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=77.96s)]
*  Those are three areas that Pete Hegseth has addressed and has shown a passion in as a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=80.6s)]
*  patriot, as a service member, and as someone who has leadership to lead our military. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=84.28s)]
*  Well, let's stay on that for just a moment before we turn back to Syria. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=89.8s)]
*  Mark, I'll go to you on this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=92.44s)]
*  There's a new article out that includes men that were involved in the helping, as all [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  three of you were at various levels and together, I think, as well in some situations, people [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=100.36s)]
*  out of Afghanistan, after Afghanistan, and dozens of men like yourself have now signed [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=105.12s)]
*  on to a letter. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=109.68s)]
*  I believe it's published in the Washington Examiner that everybody wants to see that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=110.72000000000001s)]
*  says Pete Hegseth is right for DOD. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=113.88000000000001s)]
*  Mark. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=117.2s)]
*  Yeah, he is. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=118.2s)]
*  I think he's probably got more recent experience on the battlefield, closer to the troops, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=120.36000000000001s)]
*  understands what the warfighter on the ground is feeling, needs, and what is best for the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=125.72000000000001s)]
*  country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=132.16s)]
*  As Chad said, I mean, we've got to address the issues of retention, of recruiting, and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=134.4s)]
*  we have the greatest fighting force in the world. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  And typically, why are you going to do the same thing over and over? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=145.72s)]
*  And with that fighting force, what limits us is if we're predictable or we're not willing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=149.52s)]
*  to use it when necessary, but not being willy-nilly about how we use it as well. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=155.88s)]
*  Oh, and that last point's important, Mark. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=160.72s)]
*  It is. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=162.88s)]
*  Scott, before I turn to you, I would love to just do a quick panel poll question here, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=163.88s)]
*  because for all the talk about controversy or scandal and all the focus on these things [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  with Hegseth, what matters is does he demand to do the job? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=172.2s)]
*  And I would just be curious, because all three of you have been and are in touch with the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=176.28s)]
*  warfighter on the ground, active and retired. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=181.56s)]
*  So I'm just going to go quick. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=185.82s)]
*  So let's start with Chad and come back around, because I want to end talking to Scott about [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=188.1s)]
*  something else here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=191.28s)]
*  Chad, do the warfighter support Hegseth? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=192.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=195.52s)]
*  I've never seen a groundswell of support in my 30 years around the military like I'm seeing [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=196.52s)]
*  right now for Pete Hegseth and Sec. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=200.2s)]
*  Def. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=202.08s)]
*  And Mark, you as well, as you take your pulse of the guys you served with, does he have [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=203.08s)]
*  support among the rank and file? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=206.72s)]
*  Yeah, he does. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=210.0s)]
*  I think it's very broad in who supports him, and I think he's going to be a great leader. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=211.0s)]
*  All right, Scott, let's go to the Special Forces community. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=217.84s)]
*  Do they support Hegseth? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=220.04s)]
*  Yeah, I've been reaching out to a lot of Green Berets, Will, and a ton of support from the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=223.28s)]
*  Special Forces Green Beret community on Pete, absolutely. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=229.44s)]
*  So let's pick that up now, Scott. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=232.4s)]
*  You know, I've had a lot of conversations, and I know this is something that's passionate [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=234.0s)]
*  to you, but where we focus our our attentions. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=236.68s)]
*  It's now you have expressed to me, I think on and off air, your concerns about attentions [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=239.64s)]
*  focusing away from the type of war you three gentlemen fought in that region, and now we're [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=244.54s)]
*  seeing it metastasize in Syria. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=249.64s)]
*  So when you see this bring together for me this new leadership under Trump and Hegseth. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=252.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we may be done and Chad and Mark said it brilliantly. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=258.12s)]
*  We may be done with the war on terror, but it's not done with us. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=261.24s)]
*  You know, the enemy has a vote in how they operate and what they're doing in Syria. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=263.84s)]
*  Look for expansion of the ultimately of the Al Qaeda caliphate under these different surrogate [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=267.92s)]
*  groups. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=273.64s)]
*  And Pete understands that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=274.64s)]
*  In fact, you know, Will, this wasn't in the New York article, but, you know, I was in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=275.64s)]
*  concern veterans for America and I was brought in there as a speaker with a handful of leaders [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=279.56s)]
*  who are combat veterans to talk about the role American civilians need to play in supporting [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=284.12s)]
*  our military in the war. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=288.2s)]
*  And we they tried to muzzle us. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=289.79999999999995s)]
*  You know, they tried to get us to stop talking about that and talk about pulling back from [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  these wars. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=294.5s)]
*  And as vet as a veteran, I wasn't good with that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=295.56s)]
*  And Pete said, you know what? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  Keep going, man. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  Keep talking about this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=299.79999999999995s)]
*  And I did. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=300.88s)]
*  He left shortly thereafter and I was right out the door with him as a result of that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=301.88s)]
*  And that has not been talked about at all. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=305.96s)]
*  This is a guy who has stood up for the warfighter through the Afghanistan abandonment. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=307.54s)]
*  He was working the phones behind the scenes. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=312.1s)]
*  He was helping his own interpreter get out connecting. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=314.0s)]
*  And the role that he's played with the warfighter at a grassroots level is something that I [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=317.54s)]
*  hope these senators will consider. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=322.18s)]
*  And I hope that they'll listen to what the warfighters of the longest war in our nation's [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  history are saying, which is we need reform and change immediately. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=328.42s)]
*  Well, I hope you're exactly right. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=331.26s)]
*  I hope senators are listening to I've got three warfighters here, but I can tell you [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=333.02000000000004s)]
*  from my personal experience as well, these three men represent a whole huge, vast community [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=336.98s)]
*  of warfighters to support Hexed. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=342.38s)]
*  And I'm just going to button one thing you said, Scott. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=343.70000000000005s)]
*  Isn't it fascinating that you worked at CVA, Concerned Veterans for America. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=345.90000000000003s)]
*  They're talking about a scandal never talked to you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=349.64000000000004s)]
*  They talk for vets for freedom, but they never turned a Medal of Honor winner, David Bellavia, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=352.1s)]
*  who hired Pete to come to that institution. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=355.58000000000004s)]
*  They talk about anonymous sources about his drinking, but they don't call Rachel Campos [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=358.20000000000005s)]
*  Duffier, Will Kane, who sat next to him for five years. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=361.1s)]
*  It is really fascinating. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=363.86s)]
*  They don't go to direct sources who have something to say. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=365.0s)]
*  They instead lean on anonymous sources. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=367.74s)]
*  I think you can see the quality of reporting laid out for you right there. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=369.36s)]
*  But most importantly is what you guys have told us about today. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=372.88s)]
*  The opinion of the warfighters and what's needed at DOT. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=375.84s)]
*  I really appreciate you guys, Chad, Mark and Scott, for laying that out for us this morning. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=378.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=383.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=384.08s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXb7Dzimy1U&t=385.08s)]
