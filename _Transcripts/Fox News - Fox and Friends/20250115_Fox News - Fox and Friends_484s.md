# Peter Doocy: These were Biden's final acts as president
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco)
*  Meanwhile, tonight President Joe Biden is set to give his farewell address, speaking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=0.0s)]
*  to the nation from the Oval Office one final time. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=4.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's the opposite of an Irish goodbye. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=9.0s)]
*  Irish goodbye, they just leave, you don't know where they went. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=10.72s)]
*  He's Irish and he's taking forever to say goodbye. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=13.24s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey joins us with more. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=15.44s)]
*  Peter. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=18.48s)]
*  Yeah, well, this is the last time that we expect to hear from President Biden before [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=19.48s)]
*  he retires to Delaware, and we think he is going to talk a lot about himself. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=24.12s)]
*  The White House shared a letter from the president. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=29.54s)]
*  It's not addressed to anybody, but part of it says, it has been the privilege of my life [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=31.86s)]
*  to serve this nation for over 50 years. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=35.46s)]
*  Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=37.34s)]
*  and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the resolute desk in the Oval Office as president [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=41.46s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=45.84s)]
*  We don't know if the president tonight is going to circle back on his 2020 promise to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=47.3s)]
*  restore the soul of the nation or if he's going to explain why, despite advertising [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=51.3s)]
*  decades of experience working with Republicans, he ultimately worked so little with Republicans. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=56.94s)]
*  And we see this a lot of the stuff that he's been doing lately has just been with the executive [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=62.82s)]
*  pen like pardoning Hunter Biden, commuting death row sentences, giving Hillary Clinton [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=66.98s)]
*  George Soros medals of freedom, opening up rather closing off new areas of drilling offshore, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=72.78s)]
*  transferring prisoners out of Guantanamo Bay, giving more money to Ukraine, relieving some [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=80.1s)]
*  folks who are set to be deported and taking Cuba off the state sponsor of terrorism list. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=85.86s)]
*  The president was also talking last night about how he thinks he's had the most ambitious [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=92.38s)]
*  climate agenda ever. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=96.58s)]
*  That's what he wants people to think when they look back at his term, even though we [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=98.86s)]
*  know the general mood in this country, people don't look at Joe Biden and think, wow, he's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=103.56s)]
*  doing so much for the climate. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=109.62s)]
*  They look at the last four years and they think, well, we've had some real problems [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=111.26s)]
*  with inflation and national security and the border. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=115.02s)]
*  So stay tuned for eight o'clock tonight. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  We'll see how much he talks about those three things. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=120.66s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=123.38s)]
*  Good point. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=124.38s)]
*  And that's why he is deeply unpopular. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=125.38s)]
*  Peter on on inauguration day, I think you're supposed to be in the Oval Office when Donald [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=126.94s)]
*  Trump comes in. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=132.74s)]
*  So Joe Biden's going to leave him a letter in the drawer of the resolute desk. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=133.9s)]
*  You should ask him to open it up and just see what Joe had to say to Don. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=139.5s)]
*  Would be great if President Trump, when he comes in, could show us the letter. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=145.18s)]
*  And also, what else does the president leave in the drawers? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=149.38s)]
*  Usually when somebody moves out of an office, there's like some pens, scissors, some old [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=152.34s)]
*  snacks. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=156.54s)]
*  The last time he was live at the resolute desk was when he dropped out of the race, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=159.26s)]
*  live on television. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=164.06s)]
*  The question about when he was last live is a different one. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=166.14s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=169.57999999999998s)]
*  We never found out the letter that Biden got from Trump, but he said nice things. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=170.57999999999998s)]
*  He goes, it was very it was something like gracious. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  And now he gets to return the favor. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=178.17999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=179.7s)]
*  And he'll probably do it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=180.7s)]
*  I mean, they've had that meeting in the Oval Office together, so they've been communicating. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=181.7s)]
*  So they've already broke the ice. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=186.26s)]
*  It's a special club. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=187.26s)]
*  I mean, even look at former President Obama and Donald Trump the other day, how they were [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=188.26s)]
*  laughing it up. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=192.14s)]
*  You know, they fight on the campaign trail, but they understand only those few understand [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=193.14s)]
*  that type of pressure. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=198.82s)]
*  Well, I don't know if Michelle Obama would leave a letter. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=199.82s)]
*  She's not going to the inauguration. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=202.62s)]
*  The office of Barack and Michelle Obama released a statement saying that he would be there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=204.42s)]
*  She will not be there. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=208.94s)]
*  Laura and George Bush will both be there. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=209.94s)]
*  And so will both of the Clintons. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=212.22s)]
*  So the tech we know Carrie Underwood will be there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=213.82s)]
*  Yeah, she's got a lovely voice and kid rock. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=217.18s)]
*  I think kid rock too. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=221.06s)]
*  And I would add to all the tech titans who'll be sitting together. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=223.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=227.06s)]
*  All these rivalries. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=228.06s)]
*  Musters and talk to Altman. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=229.06s)]
*  They're suing each other. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=230.9s)]
*  Bezos and Musk are fighting to get into space. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=232.46s)]
*  They'll be sitting next to each other. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=235.38s)]
*  The president has forced them all to start working together for the good of the country. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=236.62s)]
*  I kind of like I like that we have some of the smartest, richest people come into the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=241.26s)]
*  table to help us with solutions, not just being about themselves. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=246.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=250.54s)]
*  But what's good for crypto too, because we need experts on crypto. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=251.54s)]
*  Biden was suffocating him. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=255.1s)]
*  His people were suffocating. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=256.26s)]
*  Silicon Valley and the AI bros. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=257.9s)]
*  And these guys go, I don't think they know what they're talking about, but we got to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=260.46s)]
*  get away from this guy, Gensler. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=263.26s)]
*  And Trump seems to be singing our song, showing up to our events. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=265.26s)]
*  We're going to be there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=268.26s)]
*  And the one thing that was very interesting, one of these guys said that I was fascinated [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=269.34s)]
*  when I went to visit Trump because he asked the same questions to me. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=272.08s)]
*  He does to the caddy that he does to the guys who do to take care of the giving the towels. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=275.53999999999996s)]
*  He talks to everybody. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=281.14s)]
*  And I guess in the CEO world, you're not supposed to do that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=282.65999999999997s)]
*  In the Trump world, that's the reason he wins. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=285.76s)]
*  Yeah, because he likes everybody the same. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  Knows everybody's names, letters to people. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=290.48s)]
*  It's one of his great traits. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=293.28s)]
*  People. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=294.88s)]
*  I remember one time he was in our studio. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=295.88s)]
*  It was my dad's birthday and he had a message for my dad. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=296.88s)]
*  It was so sweet of him. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=299.0s)]
*  Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Zuckerberg and Altman are all going to be skipping dot, dot. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=300.44s)]
*  Trump's on cameo. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=304.4s)]
*  They're going to go together. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=305.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=306.4s)]
*  We'll have a prominent spot at the ceremony and also up there at the ceremony will be [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=307.4s)]
*  the Teamsters president, Sean O'Brien and the firefighter union president. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=311.32s)]
*  The Republicans inauguration. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=314.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=316.04s)]
*  Like, when is that? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=317.04s)]
*  When is the last time that happened? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=318.04s)]
*  Well, never. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=319.32s)]
*  And that just goes to show you how different Donald Trump is the second time around, because [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=320.32s)]
*  people saw the first time and now the hope is he gets a lot done. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=325.08s)]
*  There's a lot of unity in the country where they're going, OK, he's going to be in charge [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=330.2s)]
*  for four years. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=333.72s)]
*  Let's make the best of it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=334.72s)]
*  And that is why all those big shots are going to be on the up on the platform with him, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=335.72s)]
*  part of something big rather than being on the outside looking. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=341.28s)]
*  That's why I am predicting the biggest crowd ever at the Capitol. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=345.52s)]
*  I'm making that prediction. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=350.23999999999995s)]
*  Now here's the problem with that. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, what you do this and Sean, after we talked about this yesterday, Sean Spicer immediately [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=353.44s)]
*  texted us because he did the press conference after that in 1997. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=357.55999999999995s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=362.32s)]
*  The Congress passed an appropriation, which says, which said that the National Park Service [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=363.32s)]
*  would stop estimating crowds. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=367.68s)]
*  So there is no official crowd size estimate from the federal government. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=370.56s)]
*  It's just up to whoever wants to estimate. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=375.16s)]
*  You want to estimate how about a clicker? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=378.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=380.76s)]
*  OK, Johnson, maybe I can do it Monday. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=381.76s)]
*  I'm going to be in the crowd. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=382.76s)]
*  So maybe I don't want to. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=384.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=388.24s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=389.24s)]
*  Now, I'm telling you right now, they can see from the arrow of view. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=390.24s)]
*  They'll take that shot and they'll see. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=393.4s)]
*  All right, so we'll let you count the crowd. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  Hopefully Donald Trump won't. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=400.12s)]
*  He stopped talking about the crowd sizes. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=401.12s)]
*  Just put it back in his mind. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=402.91999999999996s)]
*  The only problem, though, is it's going to be as Janice told us, it's going to be bitterly [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=406.08s)]
*  cold there. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=410.24s)]
*  I was down in Washington during the second Reagan inauguration. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=411.24s)]
*  They never had it outside because it was so cold nobody was going to show up. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=415.28s)]
*  So you know, it could actually impact things. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=419.56s)]
*  That's why he's so great that these show up. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=422.59999999999997s)]
*  A lot of people will show up, but it could diminish. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=425.24s)]
*  But the hotels have moisturizer. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=428.36s)]
*  So moisturize before. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=430.8s)]
*  Let me just do this public notice. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=431.8s)]
*  Moisturize before and after. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=434.32000000000005s)]

*  Speaking of hotels, the Watergate Hotel down in Washington is offering an inaugural package. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=437.96000000000004s)]

*  You know what? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=455.0s)]
*  People are going to buy it and they're going to expense it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=456.0s)]
*  And they probably include a little bottle of Scope. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=459.6s)]
*  Or Lavoris. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=463.84s)]

*  What about a razor? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=467.84s)]
*  Right, possibly a razor. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=468.84s)]
*  And a shower cap. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU6c9df7Dco&t=469.84s)]
