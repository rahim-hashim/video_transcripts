# DOGE taking examples from Argentina, President Milei
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I)
*  Argentina's free market president achieving an economic miracle this year exposing its [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=0.0s)]
*  failing socialist neighbors while serving as inspiration for the push to curb government [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=6.72s)]
*  spending right here in the U.S. The country's monthly inflation rate now sits at 2.4 percent. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=11.36s)]
*  That's down from 25 percent when Miele first took office one full year ago. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=18.52s)]
*  Our next guest says it all started by targeting waste and fraud. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=23.56s)]
*  Our Heritage Research Fellow and economist E.J. Antony joins us now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=28.12s)]
*  E.J. so great to have you. This is such a fascinating story. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=32.6s)]
*  So what is the lesson of Argentina? Maybe lay out how he did it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  What kind of austerity measures he took and what's to come. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=41.08s)]
*  Well Rachel I think the lesson here is it can be done. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=47.16s)]
*  You know in less than a year Miele has cut the monthly inflation rate by over 90 percent. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  That's absolutely tremendous and he did it by cutting excess government spending. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=55.36s)]
*  He is rooting out waste fraud and abuse everywhere throughout the budget. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=60.16s)]
*  And I think that's one of the key lessons that lawmakers need to pay attention to here in the United States. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=64.2s)]
*  There can be no sacred cows anymore whether you're on the left or on the right. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=69.32s)]
*  We need to be willing to look into things like the Pentagon's budget to go through defense [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=73.32s)]
*  spending to go through Social Security and Medicare etc. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  And find waste fraud and abuse wherever it is and root it out. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=81.76s)]
*  Illegitimate payments are illegitimate payments. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=85.64s)]
*  It doesn't matter which special interest group is benefiting from them. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=87.96s)]
*  E.J. let's not pretend that this has been entirely painless. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=91.84s)]
*  So bringing down the inflation rate has caused some economic hardship on on the people of Argentina. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=94.84s)]
*  But they're just now starting to see that they're turning the corner on that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=102.2s)]
*  So things kind of get worse before they get better. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=105.28s)]
*  Well one of the reasons why it's so easy for politicians to get away with excess government spending is the fact that it's very much like drinking actually where the positive effects come first. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  You get buzzed and then the hangover doesn't come until the next day. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=120.76s)]
*  You know the reason we have such bad inflation today the reason we have such high prices is because of all the government spending that we've done over the last several years. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=123.84s)]
*  All those trillions of dollars in again weight mostly waste fraud and abuse. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=133.08s)]
*  So it may be painful to start sobering up at first but that's the path to long run health. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=137.48s)]
*  Yeah no question. Your people are experiencing some of the withdrawal symptoms from some of the government large. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=143.12s)]
*  So one of the you know one of the things that's hard about doing this I mean first of all I think the idea of having Doge is going to make it sort of take some of the political pressure off of individual members. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=148.72s)]
*  Right. Because there is now going to be this this organization that's going to start to direct where we're going to cut and also start to look at it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=159.32s)]
*  Because the hard part is every politician can say yeah I want to cut government spending. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=167.4s)]
*  But when that project gets cut in your district then that's another matter. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=172.16s)]
*  Right. Rachel you're absolutely right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  And this is why to your point a group like Doge is going to be so incredibly important. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=180.68s)]
*  You need a third party to present ideas to both the left and the right to again illustrate the fact that we can't have any shows any sacred crowds anymore. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=186.12s)]
*  Right. We need to be willing to root out again waste fraud and abuse no matter where it is. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=195.32s)]
*  And we can't let the special interests run the show anymore. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=201.4s)]
*  That's what Malay did in his country and that's how he was able to create the first government surplus in over a decade. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=204.6s)]
*  And by the way maintain a trade surplus. That's really important for a nation like Argentina that is suffering from such from such low levels of foreign exchange. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=211.68s)]
*  Yeah. He's also he's attracting a lot of foreign investment because of the moves that he's making really fast. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=221.12s)]
*  They only have a couple of minutes a couple of seconds here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=225.88s)]
*  But a big part of that was cutting government workforce. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=228.04s)]
*  That I think is going to be the biggest challenge for Doge and the Trump administration. Correct. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  I think that's right Rachel but it needs to be done. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  We have to accept the fact that many of these workers are doing duplicative work and a lot of them aren't even doing positive work. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=240.68s)]
*  They are a net subtraction to the nation's economy. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=247.68s)]
*  They have to go. Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=250.76s)]
*  A lot of them aren't even coming into work. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=252.68s)]
*  Some of these buildings are just sitting there empty because everyone's working from home. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=254.16s)]
*  And that's also cut down on some of the productivity. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=258.48s)]
*  So E.J. great story. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=261.16s)]
*  A lot of lessons to be learned and we do know that Mealy and Elon and Vivek have been interacting because I saw pictures of them together at an event at Mar Lago. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=263.32s)]
*  So we know that there has been face to face conversations about this. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=272.52s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. Great story. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=276.24s)]
*  Thank you Rachel. You got it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAcTs5EUM4I&t=279.92s)]
