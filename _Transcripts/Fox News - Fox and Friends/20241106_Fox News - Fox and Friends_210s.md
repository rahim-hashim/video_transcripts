**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos)
*  War leaders are reacting to former President Donald Trump's projected victory. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=0.0s)]
*  He's won. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=6.48s)]
*  What are we getting? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=7.48s)]
*  And Wall Street is getting a huge boost. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=8.48s)]
*  We have live team coverage from Edwin Lawrence. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=10.44s)]
*  He joins us live from the White House on the economy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  But first, Trey Yanks is live in Tel Aviv, Israel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=14.64s)]
*  Trey. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=17.8s)]
*  Yeah, hey, Brian. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=18.8s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=20.28s)]
*  Reaction is pouring in from around the world following former President Trump's projected [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=21.28s)]
*  election victory. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  We do know there will be major foreign policy decisions under this new administration that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=28.08s)]
*  will affect countries like Ukraine, Iran, Israel and everywhere in between. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted to X saying, quote, congratulations to Donald [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=38.32s)]
*  Trump on his impressive election victory. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=42.72s)]
*  The Ukrainian leader went on to praise Trump for his peace through strength approach to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=45.14s)]
*  global affairs. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  The Amir of Qatar also posted a similar message saying, quote, congratulations to President [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=49.8s)]
*  Trump on winning the U.S. presidential election. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=55.24s)]
*  I wish you all the best during your term and look forward to working together again. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=57.52s)]
*  Arguably the most notable congratulations, though, came from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Netanyahu, who said, quote, congratulations on history's greatest comeback. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=66.28s)]
*  Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=71.02000000000001s)]
*  recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=75.28s)]
*  This is a huge victory. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=79.16s)]
*  Overnight, Prime Minister Netanyahu fired his defense minister, Yoav Galant, sparking [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=80.88s)]
*  massive demonstrations across Israel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=85.24s)]
*  Trump's election victory comes at a turning point for the Middle East. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=111.72s)]
*  Experts say they believe under the new administration there could be more normalization deals between [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=115.72s)]
*  countries like Saudi Arabia and Israel. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=121.12s)]
*  Brian? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=123.64s)]
*  Let's hope, Trey, while we wait to see if Iran's really going to attack. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=124.64s)]
*  Now this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  Trump's projected win is turbocharging Wall Street. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=128.96s)]
*  Right now the Dow futures over a thousand points. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=131.4s)]
*  They are up. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=133.44s)]
*  Edward Lawrence knows all about it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=134.44s)]
*  He's at the White House. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=135.44s)]
*  Edward, make sense of it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=136.44s)]
*  Yes, the markets love this choice by former President Trump. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=138.16s)]
*  They're looking at deregulation and that's one of the big things. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=141.48s)]
*  About 1150 points you showed on that graphic. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=144.68s)]
*  That's a huge number, up about 3%. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=146.88s)]
*  So the people voted yesterday. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=149.44s)]
*  The money is voting today and money may have turned this election. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=150.92s)]
*  Money in voters' wallets, that is. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  Anecdotally, I heard time and time again life became too expensive to afford under the Biden-Harris [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=156.6s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=160.84s)]
*  You see why on this screen. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=161.84s)]
*  We saw poll after poll. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=163.0s)]
*  The economy ranked number one as the major concern followed by immigration. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=164.16s)]
*  President Trump says that he will make a turnaround in energy policy as the linchpin of his economic [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=168.48s)]
*  plans he wants to drill. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=173.44s)]
*  Then he talked about paying down debt as well as reducing taxes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=175.28s)]
*  Now in swing states like Nevada and Wisconsin, no tax on tips and no tax on overtime played [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=178.74s)]
*  very well. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=183.96s)]
*  Now President Biden, we have not heard from today. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=185.28s)]
*  We have also not heard from the vice president. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=187.48s)]
*  She is expected to talk about this later today. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=189.68s)]
*  Again, President Biden has nothing on his schedule today. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=191.6s)]
*  We'll have to see how that goes later on. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  Back to you guys. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRHc3aouos&t=196.56s)]
