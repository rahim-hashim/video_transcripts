# Nikki Haley responds to Liz Cheney's criticism: 'I don't want to see Kamala Harris win'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o)
*  All right, continued chaos in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=0.0s)]
*  You have three Israeli civilians killed in a terror attack along the Jordanian border. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=2.16s)]
*  And as a hostage talks falter with new demands from Hamas, Prime Minister Netanyahu sends [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=6.98s)]
*  a stark warning about Iran's axis of evil. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=11.58s)]
*  We are surrounded by a murderous ideology led by Iran's axis of evil. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=16.86s)]
*  In recent days, loathsome terrorists have murdered six of our hostages in cold blood [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=22.52s)]
*  and three Israeli police officers. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=27.9s)]
*  The killers do not distinguish between us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=30.38s)]
*  With reaction is former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, fresh off [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=32.739999999999995s)]
*  a trip to Taiwan. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=36.58s)]
*  We'll talk about that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=37.58s)]
*  Great to see you, Ambassador. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=38.58s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=39.58s)]
*  Your thoughts about Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=40.58s)]
*  There are thousands in the street wanting those hostages back under enormous pressure, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=41.58s)]
*  even from the U.S. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=46.66s)]
*  What should his stance be? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  He remembers what Hamas said, which is when given the opportunity, they're going to do [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=50.82s)]
*  it again. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=54.84s)]
*  He wants to eliminate Hamas. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=55.84s)]
*  It's the right thing. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=57.300000000000004s)]
*  We need to bring the hostages home. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=58.46s)]
*  But look at what's happening, whether it's Jordan, whether it's Lebanon, whether we're [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  seeing what's happening in Gaza or what they're doing with these hostages. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=63.82000000000001s)]
*  Let's remember who's right and who's wrong. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=67.9s)]
*  Israel didn't start this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=70.76s)]
*  Hamas started this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=71.76s)]
*  Israel needs to end it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  They need to finish the job. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  Do you believe that we're holding back weapons has hurt their ability to prosecute this war? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=75.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=81.4s)]
*  When I was there a couple of months ago, that's the biggest issue. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=82.4s)]
*  They just need us to support. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=84.78s)]
*  They're not asking for our military. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=86.2s)]
*  They're just saying, give us the weapons we need so that we can eliminate Hamas. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=87.8s)]
*  And remember, they're fighting our enemies. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=91.64s)]
*  So we need to help them do that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=94.36s)]
*  And it would be great to hear that rhetoric. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=95.6s)]
*  Also, Iran's a problem. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=97.28s)]
*  You mentioned that we've had two assassination attempts were thwarted here, one of which [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=99.0s)]
*  is on you. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=102.4s)]
*  You're targeting U-2. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=103.4s)]
*  They're targeting Mike Pompeo. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=104.4s)]
*  They're targeting Donald Trump. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=105.4s)]
*  Where is the pushback? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=107.04s)]
*  And they also had a cyber attack on the Trump campaign. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=108.04s)]
*  The FBI sat me down during my campaign and said they knew there was election meddling [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=111.84s)]
*  that was coming from Iran. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=115.98s)]
*  You look at all the foreign actors that are invading us through multiple ways, whether [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=117.9s)]
*  it's Iran, whether it's Russia, whether it's China, whether it's North Korea now to a certain [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=122.58s)]
*  extent, and we are sitting ducks just letting it happen. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=126.66s)]
*  We've got to do something about that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=130.46s)]
*  The one thing is Biden never should have lifted the sanctions on Iran. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=131.82s)]
*  Why it is taking him so long to put them back is unforgivable. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=135.98000000000002s)]
*  It's almost as if he doesn't care. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  He stays all the time on the beach. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  He does spend a lot of time on the beach. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=142.66s)]
*  But I also want to talk about this election. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=144.44s)]
*  You made it clear before you left, as hard as you campaigned and as direct as you were [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=145.72s)]
*  against former President Trump, you called him up and said, I'll help any way I can, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=149.24s)]
*  and you will endorse him. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=153.62s)]
*  You'll vote for him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=154.62s)]
*  So you're waiting for that call. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  Liz Cheney is the other way, a conservative Republican who says, I'm not only not going [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  to support him, I'm going to vote for Harris. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=161.78s)]
*  And she was upset with your stance. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=164.34s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=166.0s)]
*  When she stopped running, almost a third of Republican voters were looking for an alternative [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=167.68s)]
*  to Trump and voting for Nikki Haley. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  She's now saying that she is, quote, on standby to campaign for Donald Trump. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=174.26000000000002s)]
*  She's also, of course, called him unhinged, unqualified. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=179.70000000000002s)]
*  I can't understand her position on this in any kind of a principled way. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=182.3s)]
*  I think that, you know, the things that she said that she made clear when she was running [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  in the primary, those things are true. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=194.3s)]
*  Casting a vote for Donald Trump or writing someone in means that you've made the decision [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  in too many instances that so many elected Republicans have made, which is to abandon [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=209.22s)]
*  Your reaction to her reaction? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=211.22s)]
*  I respect her decision, but she can't say my decision is not principled. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=212.84s)]
*  It actually is. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  We can either vote based on style or we can vote on substance. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm voting based on substance. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=221.0s)]
*  I'm looking at the fact we can't live the next four years like we did the last four [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  years. This is no contest. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=226.66s)]
*  Harris raised taxes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=228.61999999999998s)]
*  Trump reduced taxes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=230.26s)]
*  Harris wants to stop any energy production. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=231.77999999999997s)]
*  Trump built it up. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=234.66s)]
*  Harris is weak on national security. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=235.85999999999999s)]
*  Trump was strong on national security. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=238.17999999999998s)]
*  Harris has allowed the border to be infiltrated by eight million people. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=239.98s)]
*  Trump was much harder on the border. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  This is about my family. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  This is about America. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=247.98s)]
*  These are about issues. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=249.17999999999998s)]
*  We should be very clear. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=250.89999999999998s)]
*  If you don't like him, say you don't like him. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=252.26s)]
*  But you can't say that his policies are worse than Kamala Harris's. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=254.56s)]
*  That's just not a fact. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=258.92s)]
*  So you obviously don't take that personal and it's about the country. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=260.0s)]
*  Will you go to the point where you appear on stage with him at rallies? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=264.44s)]
*  Because there's a huge I think there's a sizable portion of the especially in the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=267.48s)]
*  primary. You proved it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=271.68s)]
*  That support you only. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=273.44s)]
*  I've made it clear to him a couple of things. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=275.08s)]
*  One that he needs to go out and ask for the vote of conservative and moderate [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=277.12s)]
*  Republicans, suburban women, independents, conservative Democrats. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=281.82s)]
*  This is going to be a tight election. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=286.66s)]
*  He needs to go say, I need your vote. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  And the second thing is I'm on standby. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=290.98s)]
*  I'm happy to be helpful. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=293.06s)]
*  I don't want to see Kamala Harris win. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=294.5s)]
*  He's the candidate. He can decide whether he needs my support. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=296.98s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=300.86s)]
*  You would go on stage. Why do you think Kamala Harris has a 14 point lead in the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=301.3s)]
*  gender gap among women? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=306.1s)]
*  I think it's because Donald Trump and J.D. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=307.52s)]
*  Vance need to change the way they speak about women. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  You don't need to call Kamala dumb. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=313.4s)]
*  She didn't get this far, you know, just by accident. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=315.2s)]
*  She's here. That's what it is. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg_u_WC73o&t=319.0s)]
