# Designer babies? The pros and cons of embryo screening during IVF
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY)
*  All right, well new technology is allowing prospective parents to screen embryos for genetic conditions and even [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=0.0s)]
*  Select eye color or sex but is curating a designer baby going too far [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=8.24s)]
*  You have specified hazel eyes dark hair and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=14.72s)]
*  Fair skin I've taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions premature baldness myopia [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=18.44s)]
*  alcoholism and addictive susceptibility [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=25.6s)]
*  Propensity for violence obesity we were just wondering if if it's good to just leave a few things to chance you want to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=27.720000000000002s)]
*  Bioethicist Charles camosi joins us now Charles. You are the perfect person to talk to us about this [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=35.64s)]
*  Gattaca seemed like a sci-fi then but it's here now [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=41.96s)]
*  What what are your main concerns about this and explain to me how this is not eugenics? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=45.96s)]
*  Which I thought we decided was a bad thing after World War two after the Nazis [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=50.96s)]
*  Well, we're of a certain age and we saw Gattaca the 90s [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=55.4s)]
*  I thought maybe we'd be a lot further away from it than we are now, but Gattaca is apparently where we are [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=58.56s)]
*  At first Rachel, can I just tell you how important this topic is to be talked about in a particular context? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=64.84s)]
*  There are so many people out there hurting because of infertility [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=70.2s)]
*  So many people hurting or even loving people that have been created by IVF [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=73.56s)]
*  Probably all of us know even multiple people now walking around because of IVF [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=77.8s)]
*  And I just want to put that out there at the start we have deep deep compassion for people in these contexts [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=82.2s)]
*  But absolutely, I think almost everyone knows these technologies need particular kinds of limitations and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=87.84s)]
*  One of the particular kinds of limitations we need to think about is are we really going to tell the country? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=93.72s)]
*  Are we going to tell ourselves that babies born with certain kinds of disabilities are simply discardable? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=99.64s)]
*  That's the main [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=105.16s)]
*  There are two kinds of ways to basically use this kind of technology to screen for people [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=106.36000000000001s)]
*  with disabilities and try to get rid of them or screen for people who we want to have and pick those and discard the rest [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=110.92s)]
*  And I think especially you Rachel, you've been such an important champion for children with disabilities given your family situation and your beautiful daughter [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=118.6s)]
*  Valentina, what is and this New York Times article that prompted the segment I think talked about at such length is we have to think hard about [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=126.52s)]
*  Have to think hard about [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=135.56s)]
*  In the article they talk about people discarding people simply because they're blind right to say well [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=138.12s)]
*  We could now screen for blindness and we would discard the babies that maybe were prone to blindness and take the others [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=142.44s)]
*  Um, I think that's a really important question [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=149.24s)]
*  We do ask ourselves are we going to allow ourselves to be in the culture that just discards those with disabilities? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=151.56s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I mean the question becomes what is perfect, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=156.6s)]
*  I mean to me Valentina is perfect and more importantly, she fits perfectly into our family [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  There's no question in my mind that she is a gift from god that she came to our family for a purpose [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=165.0s)]
*  And yet the screenings send a very implicit different message. What happens when they say we we eliminated them [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  They're not eliminating by curing the disease embryonically. They're eliminating explain to our viewers what that means by eliminating [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=178.28s)]
*  Yeah, so [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  Sometimes I think they give out the false impression that this is a baby [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=188.54000000000002s)]
*  Who is blind and we're doing some, you know genetic intervention on a particular embryo [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=193.9s)]
*  But that's not of course what's happening here. What we're doing is we're getting better through orchid and other silicon valley funded [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=199.74s)]
*  Corporations we're getting better at looking at a wide variety of embryos say five embryos [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=206.78s)]
*  Say five embryos [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=211.74s)]
*  And saying well this one looks like it's probably gonna be blind [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=213.58s)]
*  This one looks like it might be obese. This one looks like it might have this, you know problem for cancer or something [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=217.5s)]
*  Um, hey, this one looks like maybe the best of the batch [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=223.58s)]
*  Let's you know, these two look like it's the best of the batch [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=226.38s)]
*  Let's implant these two and we'll discard the rest and so what we're really doing is we're picking and choosing [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=228.54000000000002s)]
*  We're not we're not we're not um advocating for a particular embryo or something like this trying to cure a particular embryo [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=233.9s)]
*  But charles this is going beyond IVF and infertility what they're saying with this article suggests in the New York Times is that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  This will be the new way to have children. In other words [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=246.78s)]
*  Everybody might have this expectation. You might even be considered a bad parent if you don't do this screening [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=250.68s)]
*  We there was an article there was a person in the article saying, you know [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=256.86s)]
*  We wanted a child who is low stress and chill [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  Um, and and and that's what we got [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=264.14s)]
*  And they were screening for different different even personality [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=266.86s)]
*  characteristics [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=270.44s)]
*  It was very shocking to me [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=271.82s)]
*  And I just think just as somebody who's had a lot of kids [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=273.82s)]
*  I mean the beauty of having a lot of kids is they're all different [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=276.46s)]
*  It's amazing how different they are and and I just think this idea that we're going to have these designer curated babies [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=279.65999999999997s)]
*  Might just make the world a lot less interesting even if you take away the ethical [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=286.78s)]
*  Questions that are very deep and spiritual indeed [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=293.02s)]
*  Last word very quickly very quickly. I'll just say [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=296.3s)]
*  I'll see that and raise you a new technology where we're assuming going to be able to create not just five embryos [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=299.74s)]
*  But thousands of embryos and use ai to screen them all and say hey, correct [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  Looks like we want these two or three. Let's discard thousands. So that's ready to come on the scene as well [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=308.7s)]
*  If we don't put a marker in now and stop it [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=313.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's very troubling. We're so glad that there are bioethicists [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=316.94s)]
*  Like you who are trusted and thoughtful who are putting a lot of thought into this because in our country [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=320.88s)]
*  There is no there are no regulations [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  There are european countries again who have had historical experiences with eugenics and who are banning it or limiting it in some way [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=329.2s)]
*  But our country there are no regulations. So we're glad that you're at least thinking about it and we're bringing it up [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  as something [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=341.92s)]
*  To ponder so charles kamosi. Thank you so much for joining us this morning an important topic [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=343.44s)]
*  Thanks for bringing it up rachel. You got it. I'm steve juicy [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtw4s99NfY&t=350.24s)]
