# DNC will be celebrating four years of ‘failures’: Trump 2024 official
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys)
*  Comrade Kamala announced that she wants to institute socialist price controls. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=0.0s)]
*  You saw that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=9.0s)]
*  Never worked before. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=10.0s)]
*  Never, ever worked. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=11.0s)]
*  This is the Maduro plan, Venezuela. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=12.0s)]
*  Maduro plan of like the old Soviet Union. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=14.84s)]
*  This is, they tried it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  How did the Soviet Union work out? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=21.56s)]
*  And this will be rejected even more so because what they're doing is a communist takeover [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  of our country. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=28.76s)]
*  Donald Trump warning Pennsylvania voters about Kamala Harris's far left economic agenda as [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=30.76s)]
*  they fight for their crucial votes with Harris and Walsh kicking off their swing state bus [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=36.28s)]
*  tour today in Pennsylvania. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=41.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=42.96s)]
*  Well, so will the Trump team be quiet this week? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=43.96s)]
*  Trump 24 national press secretary, Caroline Levitt joins us now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=46.0s)]
*  Caroline, do you plan to counter program or lay out and get ready to attack afterwards? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=49.28s)]
*  We will definitely be counter programming the disastrous Democrat national convention [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=56.76s)]
*  this week. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=61.86s)]
*  President Trump and Senator Vance are going to be barnstorming the country. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=62.86s)]
*  They'll be back in Pennsylvania tomorrow. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  They're going to be in Michigan, in Arizona, and also in the great state of Nevada. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=69.5s)]
*  President Trump talking about his no tax on tips proposal there that Kamala Harris has, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=75.12s)]
*  of course, plagiarized from him. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=79.36s)]
*  The two of them will be all over the place. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=81.08s)]
*  It's going to be a great week for our team, and we look forward to the winning message [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=82.8s)]
*  that they're going to bring across this country. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  In contrast to the losing message that the Democrats have right now, they'll be celebrating [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=88.88s)]
*  the four years of failures that Kamala Harris has brought to this country. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  Caroline, let's talk about the convergence of policy proposals because we heard Donald [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump say no tax on tips and then Kamala Harris said the same thing as well as the child tax [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=101.92s)]
*  credits. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=107.32s)]
*  J.D. Vance put this out on X. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=108.32s)]
*  He says Kamala Harris will soon propose that we finish the border wall and make America [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=109.72s)]
*  great again. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=114.24s)]
*  No one should be fooled by the fake campaign copying President Trump's vision. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=115.28s)]
*  The difference is Trump actually lowered prices as president. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=119.6s)]
*  Harris is in power now and does nothing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=123.28s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris is trying to deceive the American people, and frankly, it's insulting. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=128.76s)]
*  The difference between Kamala Harris and President Trump is that President Trump can actually [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=133.62s)]
*  implement these policies because look at Kamala Harris's record. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=138.28s)]
*  First of all, in the Senate, she represented the highest tax state in the country, liberal [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=142.16s)]
*  California. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=146.32s)]
*  She has repeatedly supported raising taxes on the American people throughout her political [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=147.36s)]
*  career. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=152.0s)]
*  She voted against President Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, which, by the way, expanded [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=153.0s)]
*  the child's tax credit. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=158.72s)]
*  And since she's been vice president, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden expanded the IRS to go [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=160.32s)]
*  after hardworking Americans. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=165.28s)]
*  In fact, under their administration, 60% of the audits conducted by the IRS have targeted [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=167.16s)]
*  middle class households making less than $400,000 a year. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=174.32s)]
*  Remember they told us they wouldn't come after us if middle class families make less than [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  that amount? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=182.24s)]
*  Well, they have broken that promise. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=183.24s)]
*  Kamala Harris will break her promise to end taxes on tips. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=184.68s)]
*  It's a policy she plagiarized from President Trump because she knows it's popular, and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=188.56s)]
*  she's trying to moderate her persona ahead of the election, and it's insulting. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=192.32s)]
*  So Caroline, what's the plan here? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  Because I do find it insulting to the American voters, but not everyone is watching Fox. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=198.92s)]
*  They're not getting the real information. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=204.04s)]
*  They're not getting the information warning them about the cognitive decline of Joe Biden. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=206.04s)]
*  And so maybe they think some people out there that she's become maggot, that she's finally [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=210.34s)]
*  been influenced by the former president, she's changed her position. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=216.85999999999999s)]
*  How do you let voters know that's not true? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=220.5s)]
*  Well maybe not everyone watches Fox, although they should, but President Trump does a lot [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=225.66s)]
*  of media all the time. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=230.46s)]
*  He sits down with alternative media instead of relying on the legacy media to push our [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=232.1s)]
*  message. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=237.58s)]
*  You've seen him do very successful live streams with especially voices that resonate with [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=238.58s)]
*  young people in this country. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=242.94s)]
*  while Kamala Harris is on day 29 hiding away from the press. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=245.86s)]
*  And our ground team is also working diligently every day to bring this message directly to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=250.62s)]
*  voters. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=255.18s)]
*  Yesterday at the rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, our team Trump registered more than 3,500 [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=256.18s)]
*  new voters. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=262.02000000000004s)]
*  We also recruited thousands of new poll watchers and got many people to submit their mail-in [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=263.02000000000004s)]
*  ballots as well. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=267.16s)]
*  So we're working hard to bring President Trump's winning message directly to voters on the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=268.16s)]
*  ground. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=272.06s)]
*  We have the best candidate in the business who is fighting every single day and not afraid [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=273.22s)]
*  to bring his message to any outlet that will allow him to do so. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=278.22s)]
*  Alright Caroline, thanks so much. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=282.02s)]
*  We invited Harris's Walls campaign on. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=283.46s)]
*  We got to check our voicemail after this segment, but up until this moment they have not responded. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=286.36s)]
*  Soon we'll get them. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=290.38s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D86P1x-_Ys&t=291.86s)]
