# Businesses put on notice over hiring illegals: 'STIFF PENALTIES'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY)
*  So let's talk about illegal immigration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=0.0s)]
*  We know the numbers of the border are astronomically down. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=1.92s)]
*  We know that the number of border patrol [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=5.48s)]
*  now outnumber the number of illegal border crossers. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=7.32s)]
*  So the big focus on ICE, and they're [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  going to start in Los Angeles this weekend [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=11.68s)]
*  for the first time, they're telegraphing, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=13.44s)]
*  but I think they know what they're doing, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  is to get illegal criminals out. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=16.88s)]
*  The question is now when it comes to businesses, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=18.36s)]
*  how do you clamp down on them to get more Americans in the job [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=20.8s)]
*  market? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  And that's one message was e-verify. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=24.92s)]
*  The other is individual states and cities coming down [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=28.16s)]
*  with some type of penalties should you knowingly [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=30.96s)]
*  hire an illegal immigrant. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=33.32s)]
*  So this is what Montana says. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=34.84s)]
*  Montana is warning business owners. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=36.08s)]
*  And they're saying if you intentionally hire illegals, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  you could face major consequences. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  It's a new proposal in the state legislature. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=43.92s)]
*  And they are arguing that hiring illegals actually [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=46.36s)]
*  harms the American worker because they're [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=49.32s)]
*  taking Americans' jobs. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  And if you violate the law, you lose your license. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=52.78s)]
*  It allows the AG and the county attorneys with the, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=55.76s)]
*  it allows them to have the money to make sure the law is [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=59.0s)]
*  followed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  And it also allows people who are negatively impacted [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=62.099999999999994s)]
*  by hiring illegals to sue. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=65.2s)]
*  So this is what the lawmakers are saying. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  They're saying having employers that are knowingly coming in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=68.92s)]
*  and bringing in illegal aliens who they know [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=72.16s)]
*  should not be in our country, and they know they should not [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  be hiring them. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  And they're intentionally doing that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=79.88s)]
*  There needs to be stiff penalties four years from now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=81.88s)]
*  We might be sitting in a situation [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  where we have a Democrat president that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=87.82s)]
*  is going to completely undo Trump's border policy [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=90.44s)]
*  and bring back Biden's border policy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=92.8s)]
*  You know, I think about this sometimes. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=95.8s)]
*  I do feel sorry for some of the illegals [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=97.8s)]
*  that they were lied to from the Biden administration. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=100.0s)]
*  They told them that they can come into this country [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  and they can just get all these jobs, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  that it was OK for them to stay. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=106.24s)]
*  But that's not true. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  We have laws on the books. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  And now what we have is a president saying, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=110.64s)]
*  we're going to enforce those laws. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=113.08s)]
*  He's not making any new laws. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=114.52s)]
*  He's just enforcing every single thing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=116.4s)]
*  that was on the books before. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=119.52s)]
*  And as a result, you see the cartel is finally on the run. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=120.68s)]
*  That hasn't happened in decades. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=124.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=126.2s)]
*  MS 13 has been declared a terror organization. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=126.76s)]
*  Yeah, Trinidad and Agua. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=129.44s)]
*  TDA, same thing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=130.68s)]
*  And that allows us to go after them the way [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=132.4s)]
*  we'd go after Al-Qaeda and ISIS, which is fascinating. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=134.2s)]
*  It gets them on the run. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=136.84s)]
*  And now we've got some cooperation [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=137.84s)]
*  with the Mexican military. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=139.0s)]
*  So I think right now you're seeing massive law enforcement. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  And I think fundamentally, they'll be in two years, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=143.32s)]
*  I think we'll be on this couch, talking about work visas. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  Because we need workers in this country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=149.12s)]
*  We just need to organize the situation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=150.92s)]
*  The president said he wants that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=152.64s)]
*  He wants taxes into it, yeah. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  And then, of course, keeping our first round draft picks [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  from Stanford and University of Pennsylvania here, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  rather than send them back to their country. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=161.0s)]
*  We live in New York. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=162.64s)]
*  There are a lot of people here on work visas. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=163.48s)]
*  But they did it the right way. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=165.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=166.6s)]
*  They came in. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  We have their paperwork. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=167.6s)]
*  They are paying taxes. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=168.92s)]
*  And there are a lot of families that need them to work for them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=170.72s)]
*  But they're doing it the right way. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=174.16s)]
*  Now, illegal border crossings down 93% [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  since Trump took office. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=179.2s)]
*  The average daily crossing last February under Biden [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=180.56s)]
*  was about 3,000 a day. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=183.76s)]
*  This month, a year later in February, it's 359 per day. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=185.6s)]
*  Angela, I will say this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=189.76s)]
*  I find it very troubling what's happening in Los Angeles, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=191.76s)]
*  though. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  You see, Tom Homan's group, ICE, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=195.0s)]
*  the US Marshal Service, and all the ATF, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  and all the Joint Task Force are targeting criminal aliens. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=200.96s)]
*  These are people that are rapists, murderers. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=204.52s)]
*  You have activists that are notifying them [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=206.72s)]
*  on bull horns in these communities. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=209.08s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=211.32s)]
*  There has to be some criminal punishment for that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=213.04s)]
*  This is not free speech to notify the criminals [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=215.88s)]
*  when the cops are coming. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=219.12s)]
*  It's like a lookout. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=220.24s)]
*  Are you now part of the enterprise? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=221.72s)]
*  I expect Pam Bondi to go after some of these people. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=223.84s)]
*  And she's already said, the people [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=227.64s)]
*  that are doing the leaking, you got Homeland Security [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  Secretary Kristi Noemson. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=232.72s)]
*  They're going to get lie detector tests. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=234.27999999999997s)]
*  Now, to prove who's the person that's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  out there leaking this information to the criminals. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  Right, somebody in the media. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  They're interfering with an investigation. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=242.04s)]
*  And if you know someone's here illegally [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  and you don't report it, that would be considered a crime, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  right? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=248.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=249.64s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=250.16s)]
*  If you know that someone murdered their mom [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=250.83999999999997s)]
*  and you didn't report it, then you're complicit too. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=252.6s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=255.83999999999997s)]
*  We'll be following. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK0QKWaDzIY&t=256.8s)]
