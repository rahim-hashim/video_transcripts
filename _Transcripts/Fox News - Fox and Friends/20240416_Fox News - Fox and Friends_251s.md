# Michael Moore: Biden knows he's going to lose 2024
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ)
*  Meanwhile, this topic of the war between Israel and Hamas has generated so many headlines [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=0.0s)]
*  over the last couple of months where, remember in Michigan, when so many people in the primary [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=8.32s)]
*  voted uncommitted. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=12.48s)]
*  It was an organized effort to show our current president, Joe Biden, hey, unless you back [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=13.48s)]
*  off the support for Israel, we're not going to vote for you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=19.64s)]
*  Tens of thousands did not vote for him. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=23.72s)]
*  Yeah, Michael Moore, who is the filmmaker and the liberal activist, he was being interviewed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=25.68s)]
*  about this and he said the reason we had those uncommitted votes in Michigan was to save [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=31.48s)]
*  Biden from himself. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=37.16s)]
*  He says the president is working against Democrats because he supports. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=38.58s)]
*  He says he's working against Democrats because the president supports this massacre, that's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=43.4s)]
*  what he calls it, of Israel slaughtering these people. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=47.68s)]
*  And he says, I know his aides are telling him he needs to go into Gaza, he needs to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=50.72s)]
*  repair Gaza, rebuild their homes, give them aid, give them water and give them food. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=54.8s)]
*  But he says he's not doing that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=59.96s)]
*  Listen to what he said yesterday. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=61.44s)]
*  President Biden, you can end this now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=64.48s)]
*  You know it's wrong. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=66.72s)]
*  I know you know it's wrong. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=67.72s)]
*  And I know I sound like a broken record. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=70.4s)]
*  And I know that you know that you're going to lose this election in part because too [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=72.56s)]
*  many people are going to stay home. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=77.64s)]
*  They're not going to vote for Trump. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=79.46s)]
*  They're not going to switch their vote from you to Trump. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=80.46s)]
*  No. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  That's not how this is going to play out as what happened to Hillary in Michigan. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=85.2s)]
*  She lost by two votes per precinct, two for the whole state, two. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=88.0s)]
*  And that's what's going to happen to you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=95.36s)]
*  Well, it's kind of interesting. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=97.36s)]
*  He has the cadence of Joe Biden. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=99.56s)]
*  Did someone tell him to whisper? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=102.4s)]
*  There's a toddler in the room next door. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=103.4s)]
*  Number two is so he's saying, don't be stupid, side with the Palestinians before it's too [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  late. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  Now, he if if you actually want to go to tactic, you say Donald Trump would be even tougher. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=112.63999999999999s)]
*  So I don't even know what he's talking about. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  He says he's being advised to really abandon, abandon Israel and he's not. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=118.91999999999999s)]
*  Yet we're looking at some of his policies that seem very anti-Israel. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  And that's not anti that's not anti-Israel enough for him because he's a socialist and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=127.83999999999999s)]
*  a fitness model. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=132.76s)]
*  Brian, what happened to doing the right thing? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=133.76s)]
*  No one is saying when it comes to the strategist in a Democratic Party that Joe Biden [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  is on the wrong side of history. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=142.24s)]
*  They're saying you're going to lose votes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  And I just think that's a bad political calculus. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=146.84s)]
*  The other thing that he's missing out on this, everybody's talking about the pro Hamas side [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  of the Democratic Party. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=153.4s)]
*  But what about all the Israelis, all the Jewish Americans that have supported the Democratic [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=154.88s)]
*  Party in large for years that are upset with the fickle approach from this? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=159.56s)]
*  The younger is the younger Jewish members of the Jewish community are not pro-Israel. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=164.52s)]
*  That's a scary thought for the future of US-Israel relations. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=170.64s)]
*  This is one of the reasons why apparently behind the scenes, according to the New York [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=173.6s)]
*  Times, Jill Biden, the first lady is saying to Joe, just stop it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=176.68s)]
*  Just end it now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=180.96s)]
*  Get it over with so that they can move on to the convention and people in his party [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=182.36s)]
*  will vote for him. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=188.34s)]
*  You know, it's so interesting that that has become the line from this administration. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=189.34s)]
*  Get it over with. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=193.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=194.84s)]
*  You guys want speed and careful. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=195.84s)]
*  You can't get both. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=197.44s)]
*  Either you want Israel to be careful or you want them to have speed, but you can't tell [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=198.44s)]
*  them get it over with. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=202.68s)]
*  And then blame them when innocent civilians get targeted as a result of this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=204.72s)]
*  Like you can't have it both ways. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=209.44s)]
*  Well, the Bible is very clear about this and the Israelis are the chosen people according [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=210.68s)]
*  to God. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=216.12s)]
*  I think that God will protect them, but we also need Americans to be on the side of Israel. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=217.12s)]
*  Israel is our ally. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=221.88s)]
*  They always have been. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=222.88s)]
*  And when you hear, when you see individuals carrying Hezbollah flags, burning the American [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=224.16s)]
*  flag, chanting these pro-Palestinian messages and these Iranian messages, it is flabbergasted. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=228.56s)]
*  Well, we will talk to Speaker Johnson about aid to Israel in less than five minutes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgZKz9OKeQ&t=235.76s)]
