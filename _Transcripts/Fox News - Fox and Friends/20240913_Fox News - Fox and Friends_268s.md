# Whistleblowers revealing 'egregious' lapses before Trump assassination attempt
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0)
*  So lawmakers calling on calling out the Secret Service after a briefing from the acting director on the attempted assassination [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=0.0s)]
*  former president Donald Trump watch [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=7.44s)]
*  Well looking forward to working with Congress to make sure that we never have a tragedy like July 13th again [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=12.76s)]
*  We will have a report very very soon that I think will [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=17.62s)]
*  Absolutely shock the American people or it should about the lapses and lags in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=23.16s)]
*  the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=30.32s)]
*  Protection that was afforded that day. I don't think the communication or the get ready beforehand was as good as it should have been [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=31.52s)]
*  So take this congressman Pat Fallon was at that briefing. He joins in that Pat. It's good to see you brother [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=38.22s)]
*  Why not public information just put it all out there for us to see I understand the investigation but the breeding [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=45.4s)]
*  conspiracy with the lack of urgency on this [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=53.44s)]
*  Well Lawrence, that's just a you want these agencies to be proactive and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=56.6s)]
*  Cooperating with the investigation and not drag their feet and be reactive because this was one of the worst days that the Secret Service has ever had [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=61.08s)]
*  And I told the director the acting director that much yesterday because I said, you know [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=68.2s)]
*  I grew up thinking that this was a premier protective agency in the world [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=72.84s)]
*  And he argued that they were and I said to him I Lawrence I said to him you weren't on July 13th [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=75.88s)]
*  I mean it was devastating the fact that what would you saw chairman Kelly just saying? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=81.12s)]
*  You saw chairman Kelly just say that they they were doing a walkthrough [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=85.16s)]
*  They only did one walkthrough and some of the departments that were the local departments weren't even at the walkthrough [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=88.84s)]
*  So you got to have all of them there and the counter snipers from the Secret Service [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=95.92s)]
*  They weren't attending they didn't attend that walkthrough either. So that is one of several really in a myriad of lapses [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=99.88s)]
*  So Congress and Senator Josh Hawley says that he got some new information from a whistleblower. Check this out [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=106.56s)]
*  It was understaffed they did not have people who had experience on it and now this advance agent [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=113.5s)]
*  I'm told it may have failed one or more for training exams [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=118.42s)]
*  It was known not to be a top quality agent and the fact that the director [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=121.86000000000001s)]
*  Will not level with the American people about what's going on here is just totally unacceptable [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=125.54s)]
*  You know and I got guys that are in the agency that have said similar things. So what are you hearing? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=130.9s)]
*  Well, Lawrence, I talked to whistleblower yesterday [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=138.10000000000002s)]
*  Okay, so get this if you're on a protective detail you do a rotation [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=140.54s)]
*  There's four times every two weeks and you do certain different things in the detail [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  but then on the fourth with the fourth segment in the last two weeks you retrain and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=149.62s)]
*  And you shoot and you do things like, you know how to protect the principal etc [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=154.85999999999999s)]
*  When you're in the field office, you only shoot 180 rounds a year to check the box [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=159.94s)]
*  So you have some Secret Service agents in the field office in Pittsburgh that were there that day [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=165.5s)]
*  That may not have done undergone any training other than target practice for over a decade [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=169.66s)]
*  That is a sub that is a cultural change that we need to make in the Secret Service [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=175.06s)]
*  You know that as well as I you need to do continuing education [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=179.66s)]
*  We did that in the military and also fitness tests as well [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=182.74s)]
*  You've got to be to be a Secret Service agent. You should be elite, you know, you have elite fitness and they don't well [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=185.98s)]
*  See see congressman [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=192.78s)]
*  I didn't even need to know that says notice when I saw agents that couldn't properly host to the weapon [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=194.18s)]
*  That the muscle memory wasn't there [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=200.82000000000002s)]
*  No, but that's precisely and that's why I was shocked when I heard that that they all they do is check a box [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=204.66s)]
*  They have to do it's on a quarterly basis [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=209.84s)]
*  They shoot 60 rounds and then 30 rounds and then there's two quarters of 60 rounds two quarters and 30 rounds [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=211.78s)]
*  That's wholly inadequate to be a Secret Service agent [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=217.58s)]
*  Also when I visited the site I got to tell you Lawrence the first thing that struck me was the proximity of the AGR building [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=221.06s)]
*  You can see that on the satellite but it is right there [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=226.54000000000002s)]
*  It's the first building that you need to mitigate and and secure and they didn't but also [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=228.86s)]
*  There is a chain-link fence that on the other side of it [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=233.62s)]
*  It wasn't secure that was only about 110 yards from where the president spoke and there were hundreds of people on the AGR property [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=236.22s)]
*  That is it's absolutely egregious and I was furious when I when I saw that well [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=242.22s)]
*  Congressman I know you're gonna get to the bottom of it. I gotta say it's still weird calling you congressman Pat [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=249.3s)]
*  Congratulations, it's good to see you. I'm Steve juicy. I'm Brian kill me [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQsmzliAP0&t=255.42000000000002s)]
