# Peter Doocy, hosts react to Biden's farewell warning to America
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s)
*  And let us start with President Biden right there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=0.0s)]
*  You're dressed America from the Oval Office at the Resolute Desk [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=3.2s)]
*  for the final time last night at 8.02 with a very grim dark [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=7.2s)]
*  tone for the future of America. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey joins us with the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=14.9s)]
*  latest. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Good morning, Peter. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=19.0s)]
*  This is the last time that a lot of people watching are ever [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=20.0s)]
*  going to hear President Biden talk about being a kid from [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Scranton and we learned that more than anything he wants to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=25.6s)]
*  be seen by historians as a visionary somebody who is happy [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=28.8s)]
*  to have the help of wealthy tech CEOs when they support him [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=32.5s)]
*  but very concerned about these wealthy tech CEOs when they [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=36.5s)]
*  support Donald Trump. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=40.6s)]
*  I want to warn the country of some things that give me great [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=42.8s)]
*  concern. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  This is a dangerous constant and that's a dangerous [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=48.1s)]
*  concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultra-wealthy [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=50.1s)]
*  people. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=54.0s)]
*  The dangerous consequences if their abuse of power is left [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=55.4s)]
*  unchecked today an oligarchy is taking shape in America of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=59.2s)]
*  extreme wealth power and influence that literally threatens [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=64.9s)]
*  our entire democracy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=68.3s)]
*  The president also talked about AI and how important it is for [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=70.5s)]
*  the future of AI to be controlled by Americans not the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=73.3s)]
*  Chinese. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=75.6s)]
*  So he wants us to trust these wealthy tech CEOs with potentially [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=76.2s)]
*  dangerous AI, but he doesn't want us to trust them with [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=79.9s)]
*  anything else and to make that point he channeled Dwight [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=82.8s)]
*  Eisenhower. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=86.5s)]
*  Notice farewell address President Eisenhower spoke of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=88.6s)]
*  the dangers of the military industrial complex to six [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=91.89999999999999s)]
*  decades later. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=95.1s)]
*  I'm equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=96.5s)]
*  industrial complex. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=100.4s)]
*  It could pose real dangers for our country as well. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=102.2s)]
*  The president struggled with the teleprompter at times giving [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=106.0s)]
*  this farewell address that as recently as six months ago is [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=109.3s)]
*  happening the same week that they told us he was going to be [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=113.2s)]
*  giving his second inaugural address and if you look at the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=115.7s)]
*  arc over the last five years, he went from 2020 Joe Biden [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=119.7s)]
*  noble Arki to 2025 Joe Biden no tech oligarchy back to you. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=124.0s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=130.3s)]
*  That is fantastic. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=133.0s)]
*  Peter maybe he wasn't having a problem with the teleprompter [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=134.9s)]
*  Arki. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=139.0s)]
*  Maybe it was just the fact that Jason to him just off camera [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=140.1s)]
*  his whole family was dressed in black sitting with there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=143.9s)]
*  You see the vice president and the second gentleman as well. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=147.70000000000002s)]
*  Maybe that's why he you know pause from time to time to does [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=152.3s)]
*  the family know when they're going to be getting their [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  pardons. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=158.1s)]
*  Well by Monday at noon, they hope unless they're going to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=160.6s)]
*  contact Donald Trump for it, but the speech it just didn't [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=163.3s)]
*  seem like he as somebody who is the the number one consumer [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=167.4s)]
*  of Joe Biden content over the last six years or so it didn't [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=172.5s)]
*  seem like he was really into it and this is surely an emotional [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=175.70000000000002s)]
*  time for him, but he gets choked up talking about just [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=179.70000000000002s)]
*  about anything involving his childhood or his early career [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=183.5s)]
*  and it just it didn't seem like it was there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=189.0s)]
*  They chose to have him make this warning instead. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=191.3s)]
*  Somebody wants to have Joe Biden be able to say I told you [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=196.7s)]
*  so the problem is a lot of very bad things have to happen in [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  the country for that to happen. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=202.89999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=205.89999999999998s)]
*  Peter, thank you very much Peter. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=207.1s)]
*  Did you see that Joe Biden was holding Kamala's hand in that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=208.6s)]
*  one picture so I don't get it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=211.89999999999998s)]
*  What is their relationship because good question. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=213.5s)]
*  At Carter's funeral, they didn't even speak now granted. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=217.0s)]
*  It was a funeral, but when she sat down they didn't acknowledge [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=219.29999999999998s)]
*  each other. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=222.1s)]
*  The one thing about Donald Trump said is we talked a lot before [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=222.5s)]
*  they walked out in the pews for that, but I don't think they [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=226.0s)]
*  get along. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=229.2s)]
*  I think that's obviously true and she's been a disastrous [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=229.6s)]
*  vice president terrible candidate and not even standing [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=232.7s)]
*  up for California at a time in which you could really shine [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=235.4s)]
*  ducks to jump into the void. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=237.8s)]
*  Was she losing her balance? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=239.9s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=241.2s)]
*  I think Joe Biden was talking about his partner the vice [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=242.4s)]
*  president. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=245.6s)]
*  Well, that could be an important part. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=246.1s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=248.7s)]
*  But the one thing is the one thing is clear. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=249.3s)]
*  Joe Biden is going out. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=251.9s)]
*  He's trying to collect as much as he can in terms of wins, but [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=253.4s)]
*  the story today in the Washington Post how quiet the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=256.8s)]
*  Democratic Party has been in defending him even Chris [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=259.3s)]
*  Coons, you know for the most part we find a camera and say [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=262.8s)]
*  Joe Biden's genius, you know, Joe Scarborough. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=265.5s)]
*  He's never this is the best version of Joe Biden. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=268.9s)]
*  So they went from that to zero. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=271.3s)]
*  So I guess they're saying don't you know, don't let the door [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=274.3s)]
*  hit you as you leave. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=277.8s)]
*  Well, I think also his legacy is, you know, they used to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=278.8s)]
*  say he was a nice honest man. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  His legacy is not an honest person. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=285.0s)]
*  I mean he lied about the partners report exactly a lot [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=287.2s)]
*  about the relationship and he's with his son and his business [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=290.1s)]
*  dealings and then he said he wasn't going to pardon him. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=293.7s)]
*  He does that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=295.8s)]
*  I even look at yesterday. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=297.2s)]
*  This is an opportunity for bipartisanship. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=298.7s)]
*  I'm not suggesting he not be a politician and say, you know, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=301.5s)]
*  I'm responsible for this deal that just happened between [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=306.20000000000005s)]
*  Hamas and Israel but to look at the reporter and laugh it off [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=309.1s)]
*  and say, what do you think? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=313.6s)]
*  Oh, is that in such a condescending way? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=314.70000000000005s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=317.8s)]
*  Does Trump deserve credit for the ceasefire and he laughed [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=318.90000000000003s)]
*  and said, is that a joke like that was that was Jackie [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=322.6s)]
*  Heinrich who asked that question and it was an absolute [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=326.1s)]
*  good one. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=329.3s)]
*  Look, you know, you talk about over the arc of his four [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=330.0s)]
*  years. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=333.70000000000005s)]
*  Remember, I think the quotation that will live on past his [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=334.4s)]
*  presidency and into eternity is the fact that as Robert [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=337.5s)]
*  Herr described him, he's a kindly older gentleman with a [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=341.4s)]
*  really bad memory. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=344.7s)]
*  Well, last night we watched for 18 minutes. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=346.0s)]
*  He had a really bad memory of all the stuff we went through. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=349.2s)]
*  He can he can put on his rose-colored contacts and say, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=352.4s)]
*  hey, it was a great four years, but there's a reason he lost [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=355.9s)]
*  and in fact his current approval ratings are at the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=359.09999999999997s)]
*  lowest at the same time that Donald Trump's approval rating [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=363.8s)]
*  have never been higher. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=368.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is more power powerful and popular in the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=369.3s)]
*  country today than he was when he came into office in 2017 [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=372.90000000000003s)]
*  was the people are excited. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=378.2s)]
*  Yeah, you know what? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=379.8s)]
*  I people are very excited about Monday and we're seeing a [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=380.7s)]
*  lot of Democrats that are even excited. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ccsQMua_s&t=384.5s)]
