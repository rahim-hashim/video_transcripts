# 'Perplexing': Sheriff describes Trump would-be shooter's demeanor during arrest
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU)
*  New details emerging about Ryan Wesley Ruth, the confirmed suspect in the second assassination attempt of former President Trump, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=0.0s)]
*  who is now in custody after Florida deputies caught his vehicle fleeing the scene. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=8.0s)]
*  Our next guest is the Sheriff of Martin County, Florida, where the suspect was taken into custody. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=12.0s)]
*  And Sheriff Snyder joins us now. Sheriff, thank you so much. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=17.0s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=21.0s)]
*  Y'all did a great job yesterday. So proud of the work of law enforcement there, working with both counties together and with the Secret Service. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=22.0s)]
*  Tell us about the suspect, when he was arrested, when he was pulled out of his car, did he say anything? What was his demeanor? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=29.0s)]
*  Well, we can talk to what you have seen probably a thousand times, a high profile felony stop out on I-95 Northbound. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=36.0s)]
*  We already shut the interstate down behind him, made the stop and then at gunpoint, ordered him out of the vehicle. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=44.0s)]
*  His demeanor was perplexing in some way, despite the fact that we had numerous people out with rifles, uniformed personnel, a helicopter, interstate shutdown. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=53.0s)]
*  He was as calm as if he was going to a Sunday picnic. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=64.0s)]
*  He looks like it in that picture. I know that you were there when Secret Service interviewed him. What was his demeanor there? Did he apologize? Did he say he was remorseful? Did he even speak? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=68.0s)]
*  No, he was quiet and we had to be very respectful. It's a federal investigation, so we don't cross the lines. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=80.0s)]
*  Our job was to apprehend the suspect. I mean, after all, he just tried to assassinate the highest profile target on the planet. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=87.0s)]
*  It was extremely fortunate for all of us that he complied because had he not complied, you'd be asking me right now, what were the circumstances of his death? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=96.0s)]
*  Right, right. Gosh, I'm thankful that's not the case this morning. Where is the suspect now? I know he's behind bars, but where? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=106.0s)]
*  Well, what we did is we turned him over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, so I don't know where he is right now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=113.0s)]
*  Okay. Did he say any... how did he know that Donald Trump was going to be playing golf? How did he have access to his schedule? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=124.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the million dollar question. You know, we are the border county to Palm Beach. You can't get out of their county without coming through ours. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=133.0s)]
*  But we don't have the intel from the scene there. It's hard for me to imagine how he got within rifle range of President Trump. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=142.0s)]
*  Yeah. Sheriff, what was your day like yesterday? I know you were all over the media. We appreciate y'all being so transparent with us. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=153.0s)]
*  But when you heard the news, describe that for us. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=159.0s)]
*  Well, I'd gotten home from church and I was having a quick snack and I heard the bolo to be on the lookout for someone who had just attempted an assassination attempt on President Trump. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=164.0s)]
*  And as I was sitting there with that snack, I knew he's heading for Martin County. My snack is done. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=177.0s)]
*  I started getting ready and within a few minutes of that bolo, my crew was on top of that car and conducted the felony stop. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=183.0s)]
*  So great that a witness there at the golf course took a picture of the vehicle and the license plate, told the police department they notified your county because they knew he was heading in that direction. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=191.0s)]
*  What's your message to that witness? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=202.0s)]
*  Well, my message to that witness is thank you. God bless you for what you did. You stepped up and you made it possible for us to apprehend the suspect because in all truth, we're not going in that description. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=205.0s)]
*  He just sailed right through my county and who knows if or when we ever would have gotten our hands on it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=218.0s)]
*  You know, we have so much confidence in law enforcement down in Florida. I know the governor there supports you all and we all support you all. Thank you so much for your work. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=224.0s)]
*  Have you talked to the governor? I know he wants to do a separate investigation. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=232.0s)]
*  I spoke to the governor's representative who is the director of Department of Transportation. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=237.0s)]
*  They're in charge of the highway patrol. And he told me that from the governor, we were we could have any asset we needed. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=244.0s)]
*  And actually, we created quite a nightmare out there. We had to shut northbound southbound. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=253.0s)]
*  I-95, we had to wait for a bomb dog to come and make sure there was no explosives in the car. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=258.0s)]
*  It was a complex scene. We made it come out right and we were able to turn the suspect over. But it was not. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=266.0s)]
*  There was not an easy scene, I could tell you that. Yeah. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=272.0s)]
*  Yeah, but when I heard that the suspect got away, left the gun there and took off in this black Nissan, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=275.0s)]
*  and then I heard a few not too long after that that you all had gotten him that I-95 was shut down. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=280.0s)]
*  I heard that Palm Beach International Airport was closed. So you all did a great job. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=285.0s)]
*  Thank you for apprehending him. And now we can hopefully get some answers. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=289.0s)]
*  Yeah, hopefully this hopefully we can keep President Trump safe. That's what we need. Thank you, Sheriff. God bless. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=293.0s)]
*  Thank you. Same. Thank you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=300.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPv92V2oQEU&t=305.0s)]
