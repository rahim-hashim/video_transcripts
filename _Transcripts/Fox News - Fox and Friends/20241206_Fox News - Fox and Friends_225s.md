*  to be a burner phone DNA on a water and according to our sources police are looking into that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  gun which they're saying is very distinct and a brand new phone. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=18.54s)]
*  Look at this showing the suspect the killer unmasked to the mask right right under his [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=23.1s)]
*  first chin where they believed he checked in with a fake ID former U.S. former joining [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=27.76s)]
*  us right now is former homicide detective and retired chief of detectives at the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=34.28s)]
*  Hartford Connecticut Police Department Brian Foley Brian I gave you a lot that's what we know. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=37.88s)]
*  Yep. What do you think's happening today. So everyone's looking at you know what's going [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=42.68s)]
*  on and trying to track down the killer. Let me talk about the insurance side of things. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=48.28s)]
*  Now Hartford the Hartford Connecticut the insurance capital of world all the major companies are [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=51.44s)]
*  there to include United Health Care with a large footprint there. They are staffed with [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=56.0s)]
*  internal investigators the best of which are all the retired cops homicide detectives the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=60.4s)]
*  best of the best get get hired by the insurance companies it pays a lot better than the police [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=65.24s)]
*  department when they get CEOs in every company they all get a large amount of threats. These [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=68.88s)]
*  threats are vetted by these retired cops now working as investigators when it becomes a [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=75.72s)]
*  serious threat they'll escalate sometimes they'll call the police department sometimes they'll call [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=80.2s)]
*  the town they live in notify those police departments. They also hire their own internal [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=84.48s)]
*  their own internal security private security as well. Some CEOs are reluctant to accept that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  beefed up security when this stuff happens. But at the same time a sudden change in a CEO is [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=95.24s)]
*  volatile has a volatile impact on the investors. So the security can actually be foisted on them [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=102.08s)]
*  be it by the board of directors the HR director the security director where they'll foist it on [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=108.68s)]
*  them. They're all nervous right now they all have increased in security. So he's in a situation [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=112.6s)]
*  where him and his wife are living separately that could cause tension just from the detective [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=117.96s)]
*  point of view it's our business. But the other thing is he's in a situation where we know he's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=121.56s)]
*  addressing the board of directors. So we know exactly where he is and where he's going. Yep. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  And we saw his bodyguard on we used to do security for him he's a really nice guy but and you could [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=130.24s)]
*  tell he's going places but he didn't understand why he didn't have security. Are you surprised [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=136.6s)]
*  New York City wouldn't have security. Yes that's complacency. You know you get complacent you know [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=142.16s)]
*  and like our mayor in the city of Hartford didn't want security and sometimes we'd follow him even [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=146.56s)]
*  though he didn't want it we would be on him just to make sure someone's watching him. That's likely [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=151.44s)]
*  what should have been happened here. That being said I know for a fact the the main CEOs of the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  insurance companies have beefed up wherever they are in the country right now. The threats have [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=161.04s)]
*  escalated. The number of threats coming into the insurance companies over the last number a couple [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=165.28s)]
*  of days have been a lot since it happened since it literally since it happened. I talked to one of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=169.84s)]
*  the main investigators at a large one in Hartford. They were already getting stuff that day hours [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=175.28s)]
*  after because believe me they wanted to know if it was a trend. They're worried about copycat [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=180.08s)]
*  people. So but United Health Care is going to have a pretty good list of suspects to compare to what [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=184.24s)]
*  NYPD who are the best of the best the varsity team they're going to have a list of suspects. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=189.52s)]
*  They'll compare the two until this assassination four blocks from here. I had no idea that this [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=194.32s)]
*  level of threats on a health care company very common and it's almost always denied coverage. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=199.04s)]
*  Wow and which is having a lot with that company in particular. Brian Foley thanks so much. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=205.44s)]
*  Thanks hopefully we'll get a resolve to this crime sometime. They're going to get them. All right [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=209.92s)]
*  I don't think there's any doubt about it. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oHXYfHHi8I&t=213.6s)]
