# 'Deepfake candidate': Kamala under fire for flip-flops
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4)
*  Here's the thing, you can't have it both ways. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=0.0s)]
*  Bidomics is working. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=2.0s)]
*  Well, the stats say a different story. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=3.12s)]
*  And if it was working, she would say, very simply, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=5.08s)]
*  I'm going to keep on doing what we're doing. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=7.72s)]
*  And if Mike Pence was to run after the last four years [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=9.56s)]
*  with Donald Trump in 2020, he would have probably said, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to keep on the same economic course [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=14.8s)]
*  that Donald Trump's on. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=16.68s)]
*  Why doesn't she just say it? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=17.84s)]
*  At one point, this is, everyone's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  waiting for the interview. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=21.16s)]
*  Everyone's waiting for the policies. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=22.16s)]
*  Because this is where you begin to cleave Joe Biden [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=23.7s)]
*  from Kamala Harris. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=27.32s)]
*  And Harris is going to say, I have no track record, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=28.92s)]
*  so you can't hold me to it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  And then the Republicans are going to go, yes, you do. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=32.440000000000005s)]
*  It's the Biden track record. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=34.52s)]
*  And she's either at that point, she's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=36.0s)]
*  got to say, I was there against my will. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=37.800000000000004s)]
*  I had to sign off on that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=40.6s)]
*  I never believed it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=41.52s)]
*  When I did those speeches, I wasn't being sincere. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=42.36s)]
*  Look at her voting record when she was a senator, Brian. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=45.72s)]
*  The most progressive, even more than Bernie Sanders. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=48.32000000000001s)]
*  We know where she stands on these issues. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=51.160000000000004s)]
*  But all of a sudden, she's trying to say, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=52.92s)]
*  oh, it's not my fault. It's the grocery store's fault. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  For price gouging. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=58.8s)]
*  It's not my fault. Even though I just [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  praised Bidenomics a few months ago, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  even though I've praised Bidenomics over the last year [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=64.28s)]
*  or two years, yeah, I do want to ban fracking. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=66.96s)]
*  Actually, I don't. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=69.88s)]
*  I've changed my mind. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=70.88s)]
*  Yeah, I want to decriminalize illegals. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=71.88s)]
*  No, I've actually changed my mind on that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=73.92s)]
*  Medicare for all. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=76.24s)]
*  Well, you know what I've been thinking. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=77.16s)]
*  I don't want Medicare for all anymore. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=79.0s)]
*  I don't know that she's ever going [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=80.88s)]
*  to have to come to account for any of that, Ainsley. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=82.0s)]
*  It's all very well laid out, as you just did. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=84.52s)]
*  Axios is reporting this right now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=88.04s)]
*  She only has to hold out for three months. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  She plans to totally redefine herself in those three months. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=91.64s)]
*  And if it comes as, well, some type of contrast [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=94.48s)]
*  to who she was in the past, so what? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=97.48s)]
*  So what? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  This is what Axios is saying. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  They're saying, a big part of Harris's plan [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  is to unapologetically change some [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  of the more liberal positions and claim [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=104.92s)]
*  her White House experience helped change her mind. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=107.56s)]
*  Yes, when she was running for president in 2019, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=110.2s)]
*  she was against fracking, as you point out, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  for the decriminalization of illegal border crossings. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  For single payer health care, no more. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=116.8s)]
*  She's backed off all three. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=119.08s)]
*  I think everything is going to come down [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  to the debate, which scares the hell out of me. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  You know, I think Dana and Jake did a great job, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=126.96s)]
*  and they didn't try to put their hand on the scale [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=130.4s)]
*  in that last presidential debate. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  They just asked the questions and let them duke it out on it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=135.68s)]
*  And as everyone saw, Joe Biden just [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=139.28s)]
*  flamed out immediately when he hit the stage. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=141.72s)]
*  The problem is, after that debate, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=144.4s)]
*  there was criticism from all the mainstream media networks [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=146.44s)]
*  to fact check in the middle of the debate. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=149.92s)]
*  And so I hope that the next debate doesn't become [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=152.56s)]
*  this fact checking back and forth, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=155.68s)]
*  because I think that's the only time we're truly [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=157.56s)]
*  going to hear from Kamala Harris in that debate. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=160.0s)]
*  But it's not up to us. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=162.28s)]
*  It's up to Vance and Trump to point out, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  do we believe you then, or do we believe you now? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=167.28s)]
*  And why have you stolen all my positions? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=170.04s)]
*  Why don't you just run as a Republican? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=172.4s)]
*  Because basically, you're flipping [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=174.0s)]
*  to leaving the New Green Deal. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=175.44s)]
*  I guess the infrastructure bill, only 38% of the money's [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=177.84s)]
*  been spent on it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=180.52s)]
*  I now want to enforce the border like Donald Trump. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=181.6s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=184.92s)]
*  But none of that's real. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=185.72s)]
*  To your point, she can't run as a Republican [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=186.24s)]
*  because everybody knows it's phony. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=188.12s)]
*  So it's up to their opponents to point it out. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=189.52s)]
*  But is that enough? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=191.64s)]
*  Is it enough to just hear from the other side, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=192.8s)]
*  your opponent, to say, hey, they flip-flopped on this issue [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=195.56s)]
*  when you don't hear from the candidate? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  Because right now, her numbers are growing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=200.76s)]
*  I think Trump has said this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=203.92s)]
*  I think he has said, look, this is where she stands. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=205.48s)]
*  She's a radical. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=207.88s)]
*  She's a social. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=208.72s)]
*  Not enough. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=209.48s)]
*  She hasn't really made a statement yet. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=209.88s)]
*  The moderators need to ask the questions, though. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=211.16s)]
*  You were against fracking for your entire political career. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=213.32s)]
*  Why are you changing now? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=217.48s)]
*  You wanted Medicare for all your entire political career. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=219.32s)]
*  What changed now? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=223.24s)]
*  You have always said illegals can come across the border. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=224.72s)]
*  You'll pay for their health care. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=228.24s)]
*  You'll pay for their house. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=229.64s)]
*  You'll pay for their food. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=230.68s)]
*  You'll pay for people's college and ask people [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=231.92s)]
*  who couldn't afford college to pay for it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=234.44s)]
*  Why are you changing now? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=236.64s)]
*  Well, did we tape any of that? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  Actually, funny you should ask, I've been putting together [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=240.04s)]
*  a montage this morning. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=242.67999999999998s)]
*  Is it ready for air? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  With the help of Lawrence. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=244.48s)]
*  Lawrence and I were up here doing this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  Will was no help at all. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=246.32s)]
*  Will was no help. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  You were no help. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=248.44s)]
*  We couldn't find y'all. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=249.04s)]
*  Watch what we put together for you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=250.16s)]
*  If you'd be so kind, raise your hand [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  if you think it should be a civil offense rather than [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=254.76s)]
*  a crime to cross the border without documentation. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=257.64s)]
*  Can we keep the hands up so we could see them? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=262.0s)]
*  Who here would abolish their private health insurance [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=264.2s)]
*  in favor of a government-run plan? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=267.2s)]
*  Raise your hand if your government plan would provide [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=272.91999999999996s)]
*  coverage for undocumented immigrants. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=275.76s)]
*  So if you look at the candidates, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=280.84s)]
*  and this is how you know that that is the real Kamala Harris. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=282.2s)]
*  If you look at the other candidates, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=284.84s)]
*  they're typical politicians. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=285.84s)]
*  They look to see what the other people are going to do. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  She looks straight ahead at the moderates [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=288.72s)]
*  and raised her hand. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=290.68s)]
*  She knows exactly where she stands on the issue. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=291.64s)]
*  Now what they're saying now, all the pundits [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=294.24s)]
*  and the people that are her surrogates, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=296.04s)]
*  is that the vice presidency has made her more moderate. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=297.68s)]
*  That she now understands how government works, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=302.16s)]
*  except for any time they wanted to get [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  some crazy progressive agenda and it's 50-50 in the Senate, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=307.92s)]
*  she voted for it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=311.32s)]
*  So I'm not sure there was a change in Kamala Harris. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=312.72s)]
*  And she's scheduled to put out an economic policy plan [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=315.64s)]
*  today, Lawrence, which while lied on details, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=318.2s)]
*  does embrace some far-left ideas like price controls. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  This is the Trump economic agenda. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=326.2s)]
*  Cut costs by eliminating regulation, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=327.88s)]
*  boosting energy independence, end tax on tips [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=329.56s)]
*  and social security, extend 2017 tax cuts and jobs, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  lower the corporate tax rate from 21 to 15, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=337.47999999999996s)]
*  and then increase tariffs up to 20%. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=340.4s)]
*  But most importantly, focused on China there at 60%. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=342.48s)]
*  By the way, what is Kamala Harris' tax plan? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=345.64000000000004s)]
*  We still haven't heard anything about what they plan on doing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=348.6s)]
*  She agreed with AOC when AOC said, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=351.08000000000004s)]
*  I think we should tax the American people 70% to 90%. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good idea. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=356.8s)]
*  You live on 10%. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=357.8s)]
*  You go to work and you give 90% to the government. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=359.24s)]
*  And she said, yeah, let's talk about that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=362.0s)]
*  Well, let's talk about it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=363.92s)]
*  I'm going to do something that Will would normally point out. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=364.72s)]
*  You ready for this? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=367.56s)]
*  On that sound bite when they put up their hands, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=368.64000000000004s)]
*  what happened after? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=370.6s)]
*  The crowd cheered. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=372.72s)]
*  This is her risk. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=374.20000000000005s)]
*  If she actually runs on what is a Trump agenda [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=375.6s)]
*  on forcing the border and doing all these things, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  and I had revelations about fracking and drilling, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=381.56s)]
*  she could alienate those people. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  Or in general election. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=386.56s)]
*  Or keep them at home. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=387.8s)]
*  Or they're going to go, or she's going to do winking and nod. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=389.32000000000005s)]
*  Don't worry about it when I get in there. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  But those are good people, too, who sincerely [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=395.0s)]
*  believe what they believe. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=397.24s)]
*  Are they going to vote for someone that's telling everyone [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=398.68s)]
*  they're not going to do anything that he wants? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=401.24s)]
*  The left is going to vote for her, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=403.2s)]
*  because they cannot stand on Donald Trump. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=404.32s)]
*  The right and all the maggots are going to vote for Donald Trump. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=406.04s)]
*  But yesterday, the Fox News poll showed independence, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=410.72s)]
*  and he was ahead by eight points. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=413.2s)]
*  That was big. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=414.76s)]
*  And Hispanics, too. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=415.8s)]
*  And the Fox poll is much more positive than the Quinnipiac [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=416.56s)]
*  poll. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=419.0s)]
*  And as Donald Trump pointed out yesterday, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=419.48s)]
*  she goes, the Fox polls aren't great to me. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=421.16s)]
*  And even critics would say Donald Trump [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=423.64s)]
*  underpolls all the time, 2016 and 2020. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=425.92s)]
*  I guess my fear, real quickly, is there has been an over, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=429.44s)]
*  I guess, criticism on when it comes to the popular vote. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=434.92s)]
*  But when you look at the states, it still [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=438.76s)]
*  looks like Donald Trump is winning within the states. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=441.36s)]
*  When you look at the RCP average of all of the polls, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  everybody keeps saying, oh, he's going to change his step. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  He's going to change his step. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=449.6s)]
*  Something has to change. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=450.48s)]
*  Something has to change. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=451.48s)]
*  I'm not sure that's true. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=452.92s)]
*  He's still winning when it comes to the electoral college. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=454.4s)]
*  That's how you win elections. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=457.64s)]
*  Everybody always knew it was going to be a tight race. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9eNEjDySH4&t=459.4s)]
