# Elon Musk issues chilling warning: This could determine the 'destiny of humanity'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4)
*  So Elon Musk is spending a lot of money to get out the vote in Wisconsin for an election that could flip the state Supreme Court from liberal to conservative. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=0.0s)]
*  All in on Florida, two major congressional races that could impact the balance of power in the House. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=10.0s)]
*  Brooke Sigman breaks it down, both of them for us. Hey, Brooke. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=15.0s)]
*  Hey, good morning. So Wisconsinites will vote tomorrow to decide control of the state's highest court. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=19.0s)]
*  So the high stakes Supreme Court race is smashing spending records with more than $80 million spent so far in mega donors supporting both candidates. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=24.0s)]
*  That's liberal judge Susan Crawford and conservative candidate Brad Shamel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=32.0s)]
*  Now, Elon Musk and his America pack have spent more than $12 million in Wisconsin to support Shamel for the vacated seventh seat. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=36.0s)]
*  Musk spoke at a town hall in Green Bay last night, sporting a cheese head and emphasizing the race's importance. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=44.0s)]
*  What's happening on Tuesday is a vote for the which party controls the US House of Representatives. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=51.0s)]
*  That is why it is so significant. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=61.0s)]
*  And whichever party controls the House, you know, it to a significant degree controls the country, which then steers the course of Western civilization. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=64.0s)]
*  So it's like I feel like this is one of those things that that may not seem that it's going to affect the entire destiny of humanity, but I think it will. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=74.0s)]
*  Musk's appearance was met with protesters who slammed him for handing out one million dollar checks to voters who signed a petition against, quote, activist judges. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=84.0s)]
*  Now, the Wisconsin Supreme Court actually rejected a Democrat attorney general's attempt to block Musk's giveaway to voters. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=94.0s)]
*  Shamel spoke about his record on Fox News Sunday. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=101.0s)]
*  Listen. My opponent has given terrible sentences in sex offender cases. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=104.0s)]
*  Every case that she cited in an ad when I was a D.A., I made a recommendation that the judge didn't even follow and gave less time than I recommended. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=110.0s)]
*  So I didn't give anybody a sweetheart deal. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=120.0s)]
*  I've never come up short in any of that. She's lying to voters. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=122.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Florida, there are two major races tomorrow, one to fill Matt Gaetz's vacated house seat and another to replace White House national security adviser Mike Walz. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=127.0s)]
*  So in the first congressional district, Republican Jimmy Petronas and Democrat Gaye Valamon are running to replace Gaetz. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=137.0s)]
*  Petronas is the state's chief financial officer and has also received President Trump's endorsement. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=143.0s)]
*  And for Walz's seat in the sixth congressional district of Florida, Trump backed Republican state senator Randy Fine is facing off with Democrat Josh Wilde. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=149.0s)]
*  Lawrence. Thank you, Brooke. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=157.0s)]
*  Let's bring him in. Florida state senator Randy Fine joins us now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=160.0s)]
*  Senator, thanks so much for joining the program this morning. Thanks, Lawrence, for having me. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=163.0s)]
*  So good to have you. So when we look at some of the ballots that have been cast so far, you got 40 percent of Democrats. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=168.0s)]
*  You got 44 percent of Republicans and then you got about 14, almost 15 percent of unaffiliated voters. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=175.0s)]
*  So there is a slight edge versus the Democrats. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=182.0s)]
*  I guess the question is, how are you going to get your voters to show up on Election Day? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=187.0s)]
*  Because right now it's too close for comfort. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=192.0s)]
*  Well, Lawrence, as of now, nine percent more Republicans have voted than Democrats. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=196.0s)]
*  And look, our voters tend to vote late. They like to vote on Election Day. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=200.0s)]
*  The important thing is for those who agree with President Trump, who support the Trump agenda, my opponent is endorsed by Bernie Sanders. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=203.0s)]
*  For the people who support President Trump to go to voterandyfine.com, find their polling place, make a plan to vote, tell their friends and show up tomorrow. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=211.0s)]
*  When that happens, we're going to win. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=219.0s)]
*  Yeah. When you look at some of the numbers, know that that have been spent in this stage, a lot of the money coming in is out of state. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=221.0s)]
*  You raised about one point six million dollars, but the other side has nine million dollars. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=228.0s)]
*  Has that impacted this race? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=233.0s)]
*  Well, it certainly has. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=236.0s)]
*  Look, he's raised money from all over the country through Act Blue, which, as many people know, raises money in suspicious ways. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=238.0s)]
*  But you also have to look at how the money is spent and you can get a good sense of socialism from this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=244.0s)]
*  I didn't even know as a candidate you could pay yourself a salary. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=249.0s)]
*  This guy is actually taking money out of his campaign and putting it in his pocket. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=253.0s)]
*  He's living in a fifty one thousand dollar Airbnb. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=257.0s)]
*  He's paying his rent in his out of district home in Orlando. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=260.0s)]
*  So people have to say, do they want conservative fiscal common sense? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=264.0s)]
*  I've actually invested my own money in the race versus a guy who actually puts the money in his pocket. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=268.0s)]
*  We're going to win. If people go to the website, voterandyfine.com, figure out how to vote. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=273.0s)]
*  We're going to win big tomorrow. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=278.0s)]
*  You know, Senator, we've seen in a lot of these races that when President Donald Trump is on the ballot, people show up. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=279.0s)]
*  But when he's off the ballot, the turnout is much lower. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=285.0s)]
*  So I guess the question is, what are you going to be able to do to spark that same energy? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=290.0s)]
*  And tomorrow's the day to get these people to show up. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=295.0s)]
*  Well, we're reminding people that President Trump's who asked me to run, we talked about my endorsement. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=300.0s)]
*  We talk about the amazing teller rally we did with the president on Thursday, where he talked about how important my race was and how important he liked me. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=305.0s)]
*  I mean, it's the crux of our campaign to make people understand that the Trump agenda is on the line. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=314.0s)]
*  And if you're a conservative Republican in that sixth congressional district, you got to go to voterandyfine.com, make a plan to vote, find out where your precinct is and show up tomorrow. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=319.0s)]
*  When Republicans do what they do on Election Day, we will have a big win tomorrow night. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=328.0s)]
*  But everyone's got to make a plan to vote. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=333.0s)]
*  All right. Well, good luck, Senator. We'll be watching it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=336.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl0hJDs6AI4&t=343.0s)]
