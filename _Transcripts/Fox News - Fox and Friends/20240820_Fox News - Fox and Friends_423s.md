# 'This is awful': Longtime Biden aide furious at DNC
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw)
*  All right. On this Tuesday, it's actually day two of the DNC in Chicago, and President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden will be out of sight after officially passing the torch to Kamala Harris in a post-prime [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=7.44s)]
*  time speech at 1128 last night. That's when it kicked off. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  Biden immediately left Chicago, starting a vacation in California after telling reporters [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=17.32s)]
*  he could have won re-elections. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=22.12s)]
*  Hmm. I could barely make him out there. He's in his drop shadow. Senior White House correspondent [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=23.48s)]
*  Jackie Heinrich joins us live from Chicago, and she is well-lit. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=28.54s)]
*  Jackie. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=32.1s)]
*  Good morning, guys. And thank you, Brian. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=35.1s)]
*  You know, Democrats pushed the president out of prime time just four weeks after they pushed [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=37.18s)]
*  him out of the race entirely. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=41.78s)]
*  And it reportedly didn't go over well with his allies. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=43.58s)]
*  One longtime Biden aide texted a reporter, quote, This is awful. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=46.7s)]
*  He literally set up a campaign and handed it over to them. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=50.94s)]
*  Do they have to cut him out of prime time? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=54.34s)]
*  This was the only night of the convention that was all about Joe Biden. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=56.86s)]
*  Everything he took in from the stage would have been his. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=60.459999999999994s)]
*  And remember, he didn't get any reception like this in 2020 because of the pandemic. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=63.54s)]
*  He accepted his nomination in a parking lot. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=67.94s)]
*  The National Mall at his inauguration was empty. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=70.5s)]
*  He took to the podium after wiping a tear from his eye with his back half turned to the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=73.7s)]
*  crowd. And finally, Nancy Pelosi came clean about the pressure campaign that Democrats [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=77.9s)]
*  put on after first claiming she never made a single call. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=82.94s)]
*  Talk to him is what I have to do. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=87.82s)]
*  Right. He made the decision for the country. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=89.98s)]
*  My concern was not about the president, but about his campaign. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=93.82s)]
*  As you as he has seen the exuberance, the excitement [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=98.78s)]
*  that has come forth in our country. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=103.82s)]
*  Biden says he has not spoken to Pelosi since he dropped out, but he came to realize what he [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=106.58s)]
*  needed to do, even though he still believes he could have won. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=113.06s)]
*  The party thought they'd move Senate seats or House seats. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=117.38s)]
*  That would have been the topic you would have had to cover the entire campaign. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=121.33999999999999s)]
*  And it wasn't worth it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=126.38s)]
*  Well, you know, I always think you could have won and you go back and look at the numbers. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=127.38s)]
*  We weren't that far behind. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=131.82s)]
*  The Democrats are undeniably more energized with a new nominee, and Biden tried to give [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=133.06s)]
*  Harris plenty of credit in the speech that laid out what he sees as his legacy story. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=137.62s)]
*  I've made a lot of mistakes in my career, but I gave my best to you for 50 years. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=143.66s)]
*  Like many of you, I've given my heart and soul to our nation. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=152.06s)]
*  Biden's last big political moment was raw at times. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  He sounded pitchy as he started out mustering the grace to deliver this handoff that his [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=160.02s)]
*  party demanded. But it was a very clear snapshot of the reality in politics. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=165.5s)]
*  You have a lot of friends until you're no longer useful to them. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=169.86s)]
*  That's right. So Jackie, last week we were talking a little bit about how David Plouffe [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=173.26s)]
*  was coming in to the House and he was talking about the fact that he was going to be the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=178.54s)]
*  last week. We were talking a little bit about how David Plouffe was coming in to join the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=182.62s)]
*  campaign and stuff like that. There seemed to be an internal power struggle between the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=186.5s)]
*  campaign and the White House and Wilmington and everything else. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=192.02s)]
*  Have they worked that out or are the long knives still out? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=194.94s)]
*  You know, we're starting to see Harris's circle fill out. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=200.54000000000002s)]
*  I think we're noticing she's stacking the people around her with people who've known her [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=204.06s)]
*  for a long time. I'd be curious to know if Joe Biden gave her any advice on whether to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=209.18s)]
*  bring in people from the Obama camp. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=215.34s)]
*  Some people who were in his inner circle are no longer in the inner circle. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=218.14000000000001s)]
*  You heard Anita Dunn yesterday say that we weren't going to hear any legacy talk from Joe. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=221.9s)]
*  It seems like she didn't really get a preview of his speech. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=225.5s)]
*  And just four weeks ago, she was in the room with him every night. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=228.18s)]
*  So after that pressure campaign built up, I really wonder what advice the president gave to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=231.18s)]
*  Harris as she tries to build her own team. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=235.62s)]
*  Right. It's kind of merging everything. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=238.26s)]
*  I don't know how long she keeps it in Delaware. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=239.9s)]
*  There's no reason for it to be in Delaware, right? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=241.34s)]
*  None. It would just take a long time to call Mayflower moving and move them to some place else. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=243.02s)]
*  The jobs are based there, though. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=248.06s)]
*  Or they can open bid. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=249.26s)]
*  It doesn't have to be Mayflower. It could be anybody. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=250.78s)]
*  A lot of people are saying thank you so much, Jackie. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=253.46s)]
*  A lot of people are talking about how it was intentional that they put Joe Biden in so late [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=256.38s)]
*  last night. I was like, my gosh, how much longer am I going to have to stay awake? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=261.5s)]
*  Because I wanted to see it all. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=265.62s)]
*  You know, we could wake up in the morning and watch it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=266.82s)]
*  And then what did you see at the bottom of the screen that put you over the top? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=268.06s)]
*  I was flipping around channels and it said, coming up next, Chris Coons. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=270.46s)]
*  I'm like, why? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=275.74s)]
*  And then Raphael Warnock. What? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=277.9s)]
*  I want to see Joe Biden. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=281.34s)]
*  I want to see I want to see Joe Biden. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  And then I want to go to bed. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=284.94s)]
*  But well, the thing is, yeah, what I did is just watch the replay. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=286.26s)]
*  I got to get you a VCR. I'm doing that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=289.94s)]
*  I've got to get some sleep tonight. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=291.9s)]
*  But I would I would add this. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=293.34s)]
*  It looks like they cut James Taylor out. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=294.66s)]
*  They cut Debbie Wasserman Schultz and somebody else out. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=296.1s)]
*  It still went long. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=298.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, if you look at their platform with all the mentions of reelection of Joe Biden, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=299.5s)]
*  how many 19? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=303.46000000000004s)]
*  And then they realized they had these speakers with no discipline at all. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=304.66s)]
*  I guess that's not unique to the Democratic convention. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=308.5s)]
*  But we got spoiled last month. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=310.70000000000005s)]
*  Things went off like a top. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=312.54s)]
*  But you could see by Jake Taker's toppers comments that I will watch replay [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=313.90000000000003s)]
*  this morning, they were saying, well, it was pretty long. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=317.78000000000003s)]
*  It was 49 minutes. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=320.26000000000005s)]
*  And it was all over the place. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=322.22s)]
*  It was legacy. And it could have been. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=323.66s)]
*  And Van Jones came out and said, well, it could have been shorter. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=325.26000000000005s)]
*  Well, it could have been. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=327.94s)]
*  Yeah. And it wasn't just long, though, guys. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=328.78000000000003s)]
*  It was full of things that says that everything is going right with America. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=331.26000000000005s)]
*  The border has been fixed. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=335.90000000000003s)]
*  That inflation has been fixed, that they've given all the goodies to the American people. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=337.90000000000003s)]
*  And you just got to wonder after he painted such a glowing picture of his administration. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=342.62s)]
*  Why would they force a guy like that out of the race? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=348.06s)]
*  Well, you know, here's the thing about it going past primetime. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=351.06s)]
*  And that is they if you're going to do a TV show, you should probably have a TV [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=355.34s)]
*  producer doing it, because obviously, if they just had politicians saying, OK, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=359.94s)]
*  these are the people we owe five minutes to. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=364.21999999999997s)]
*  So we've got 75 people who are going to speak before Joe Biden. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=366.78s)]
*  It was very poorly produced. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=369.73999999999995s)]
*  And as Jackie was highlighting, even people inside the Biden circle are like, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=371.9s)]
*  look, they're screwing him. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=376.78s)]
*  He's whiny. He has to give the speech. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=378.09999999999997s)]
*  He never wanted to give, which is so long. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=380.5s)]
*  Everybody had a great life. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=382.78s)]
*  He didn't want to do that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=384.54s)]
*  He was squeezed out by the party and then he was squeezed out by the show. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=385.62s)]
*  They should have put him on at nine o'clock Eastern Time [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=389.94s)]
*  and then had Chris Coons go after him. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=393.22s)]
*  But it's insulting. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJj92gOxTQw&t=396.42s)]
