# Hegseth orders Pentagon to stop cyberoperations against Russia
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k)
*  All right, the White House is pausing all military aid for Ukraine days after President Trump and Zelensky had that heated Oval Office meeting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm sure you saw that the decision also comes after Zelensky said a deal to end the war is still very very far away [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=7.32s)]
*  leading to this response from President Trump I [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=14.4s)]
*  Just think he should be more appreciative because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=17.84s)]
*  He said he thinks the wars gonna go on for a long time [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=23.48s)]
*  And he better not be right about that. I want one thing to happen [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=28.24s)]
*  I want all of those young people to stop being killed. They're being killed by the thousands every single week [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=32.12s)]
*  That's always been his objective Florida congressman and member of the foreign affairs committee Brian Mass joins us now [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=38.64s)]
*  Congressman your thought about the president cutting off aid look his tone his tone his actions [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=44.68s)]
*  They are bringing Europe to the place that they need to be to make this a real partnership, right? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=50.72s)]
*  Without the president doing what he's doing you don't get what was announced last night, which is EU saying they're putting 150 billion dollars [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=55.08s)]
*  Into a defense fund before they wouldn't raise their debt. You don't get Germany saying they're putting 400 billion into a defense fund [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=62.56s)]
*  You don't get UK saying they're gonna do another 2 billion every single year [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=68.76s)]
*  That's wholly a result of the president's tone in his tactics [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=72.56s)]
*  So if you're you've met with Zelensky, right? I met with Zelensky about a week before he went to the White House [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  Would you pick up the phone and say call up the president and work this out and maybe put that in the speech tonight? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=81.16000000000001s)]
*  I would tell you know speak to the president be grateful that he gave you everything that you were asking the American people for a [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  Week before you went to the White House [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=93.28s)]
*  He brought that to you and you found a way to screw it up now go back and fix it [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=95.0s)]
*  So I just see the say Pete Hagseth secretary of defense is halting cyber operations against Russia. Why would he do that? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  This is something that the administration the president everybody that's negotiating [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  They're trying to be the middle-of-the-road neutral arbiter that can be viewed by both sides as somebody that can actually bring a peace deal [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=108.88s)]
*  That's why they're stepping away [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=116.0s)]
*  I think in that respect to make sure that they can be the ones that say I'm gonna sit talk to your side of the table [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=117.36s)]
*  I'm gonna talk to your side of the table. We're gonna get this done [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=122.36s)]
*  Are you worried about Keefe falling because of our aid slowing down? No, I'm worried about [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=124.72s)]
*  Making sure that Europe steps up and realize that the partner that America needs is a Europe that can stand on its own [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=131.12s)]
*  That's what makes this the best partnership. They haven't been there [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=137.2s)]
*  We know for a fact that Europe is still putting more into oil and gas in Russia than what they're actually putting into defense of Ukraine [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=140.96s)]
*  That's not the Europe that we need. That's the biggest worry here [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=148.4s)]
*  The president is changing that that out and I'm glad you're calling them out on that something else going on [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=151.54s)]
*  President Trump said when I take over there you better let out those hostages [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=155.96s)]
*  He said that to Hamas and they're beginning to come out former hostages. I think seven and all are traveling to the White House [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=159.72s)]
*  They're here. They're my imagine they're gonna go to the speech tonight [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=165.28s)]
*  What's that message knowing that that job is not yet done in Gaza and some still sit in tunnels waiting for their freedom [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=168.4s)]
*  But you and I both know the president he takes the time to listen to people to hear their stories [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=175.14s)]
*  He's touched by people's stories [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=179.4s)]
*  I guarantee he's listening to them about the torture the the living in tunnels the being starved the being raped and he's making sure that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=181.12s)]
*  There's a commitment that if there's an American being held, there's an American coming to get he told me on radio [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=188.24s)]
*  That if BB has to go in he has to go in trust his judgment [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=193.11999999999998s)]
*  What does that say to you? Also Iran's watching? Well? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=197.48s)]
*  BB has been the tip of the spear in dealing with Iran the Houthis Hezbollah Hamas [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=201.32s)]
*  Making sure that those terrorist entities that we don't want that they're being destroyed in in Syria in Lebanon and all these other places [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=205.92s)]
*  That's a partner that we need the president is looking at the situation [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=212.64s)]
*  Guaranteed and say that strength you have the commitment to destroy the tunnels [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=216.6s)]
*  Make sure that Hamas never returns great. We're willing to work with a partner like that Brian [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=220.8s)]
*  What do you think it's gonna be like tonight? Yeah in in Congress? I think it's gonna [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=224.84s)]
*  I heard the Congressional Black Caucus is wearing black [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=229.36s)]
*  I think it's because it's a mourning for the Democrat Party because the president's putting nails in the coffin right there [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=231.88000000000002s)]
*  He's delivering on the American dream making America more secure [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=236.96s)]
*  Which he talked about in the first term on the southern border in so many places [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  He's delivering jobs to the American people a Honda Civic plant into, Indiana [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=243.84s)]
*  Taiwan semiconductor into Arizona. He's bringing jobs to the United States of America [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=249.24s)]
*  He's getting government out of the way and he's making for the first time in our lifetimes the American government spend less [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  That's the American dream, and I just love these taking down the cartels [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  I didn't think it's gonna happen, but evidently 900 arrests in Mexico, so maybe that's the key to stop [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=261.68s)]
*  He promises it it happens. I miss you promised to show up and you came. Yeah great to see you in person. It was fantastic [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXKZHpLu_k&t=266.68s)]
