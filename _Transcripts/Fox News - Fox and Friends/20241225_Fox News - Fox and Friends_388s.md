# 'DISGUSTING': Biden scolded for handing 'total slap in the face' to crime victims' families
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ)
*  She was shown no mercy at all. This man walked into the bank, never said two words to her, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=0.0s)]
*  shot her three times. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=6.44s)]
*  Twelve jurors unanimously voted for the death penalty. That is what was fair. And Biden [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  took that away from us. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=15.88s)]
*  I am upset that this is even happening, that one man can make this decision without even [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=17.64s)]
*  talking to the victims without any regard for what we've been through, what we're going [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=25.62s)]
*  through. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=30.740000000000002s)]
*  Well, now Trump is speaking out saying, quote, as soon as I am inaugurated, I will direct [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=31.740000000000002s)]
*  the Justice Department to vigorously pursue the death penalty to protect American families [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=37.54s)]
*  and children from violent rapists, murderers and monsters. We will be a nation of law and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  order again. Here to react is Jason Chey Fitz. Jason, Merry Christmas. Thank you for getting [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=48.18s)]
*  up early and taking time to join us. And, you know, when that family was talking about [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=54.940000000000005s)]
*  a jury came to that decision and you look at the 37 commutations that Biden gave, but [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  then didn't decide to include the Boston bomber, the murder at the Charleston church or the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=68.06s)]
*  Tree of Life synagogue, he just sort of decided, well, I know better. My conscience is somehow [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=75.02000000000001s)]
*  superior to that of a jury. What's your reaction? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=81.24s)]
*  A total slap in the face. It's embarrassing what President Biden did. It doesn't seem to be [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=86.88s)]
*  done on principle because he did have some exceptions out there. And of course, those are [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  some of the most high high profile cases. And it really at this point, Griff, it's all about [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  the victims and it's a total slap in the face to the victims. Here it is just before Christmas [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=104.8s)]
*  when this decision was made. And now they're going to pull this back as if they were giving [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=110.48s)]
*  some sort of Christmas gift to the people on death row. What about the victims? You know, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=115.28s)]
*  that family you just showed has to relive this again. They're out there in the spotlight. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=120.12s)]
*  Now they have another change and it's just disgusting. And why do this? Why not talk to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=125.68s)]
*  the victims? Why not prioritize them? But, you know, Joe Biden just is totally asleep at [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  the wheel and it's well, it's an embarrassment. I feel for these families. You mentioned asleep [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=138.68s)]
*  at the wheel and how could you not have compassion and feel for these families? It's unique that it [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  happened right before Christmas. I think presumably he could have if he was going to make the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  decision to do it after Christmas because you're right in the case of the Snell family, Amanda [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=154.08s)]
*  Snell, that was murdered by Jorge Avila Torres. He was his sentence commutated. And of course, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  for that family, it's a dagger of grief thrust again into their family. This individual, by the way, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=164.84s)]
*  Jorge Avila Torres, before killing Marine Amanda Snell, murdered and raped an eight and nine year old. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=171.84s)]
*  Her names, their names were Crystal DeBias and Laura Hobbs. And it just begs the question, Jason, do you [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=179.32s)]
*  think Joe Biden knows Laura Hobbs and Crystal DeBias' name and even knows who these people are? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=185.08s)]
*  I think the president, President Biden, owes these families and owes the nation an explanation of why he [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=191.32s)]
*  did each and every one of these. I don't see any other scenario other than talking to the families [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=199.16s)]
*  and explaining to them and to the country. Why can't he go out there on his perpetual vacation and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=206.84s)]
*  actually explain why he did this? Because there's no explanation in terms of principle. Otherwise, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=213.88s)]
*  they wouldn't have the exceptions. And why not go out there and explain that to the American people? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=219.8s)]
*  And I don't think he can. I just I'm shocked that he did this. He cannot leave soon enough. We can't [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  have Donald Trump in there fast enough. I can tell you that. Well, and with the incoming administration, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=234.36s)]
*  there seems to be some hope from tariffs to the Panama Canal, to border security and more. It feels [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=239.96s)]
*  like America is back, baby, as Americans say they're more hopeful about 2025 than they were here. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  Take a quick look at this poll we've got here. Outlook on Trump's second term, 52% positive, 48% [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=251.24s)]
*  negative. What do you make of it, Jason? Oh, I think the numbers are even higher than that. Look, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=257.96s)]
*  going into the election, two thirds of Americans were telling us that the country is off track [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=263.88s)]
*  and Donald Trump hasn't even taken office yet and everybody's feeling more optimistic. Why? Because [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=268.68s)]
*  he's going to actually do what he said he's going to do. He's actually going to play offense. He's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=274.2s)]
*  going to put America first. He's going to lock down those borders, take care of us overseas, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=278.2s)]
*  tackle inflation, get the economy humming again. And it's amazing what the guy's been able to do. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=282.92s)]
*  And he's still about 30 days out from being sworn in as the president. So I think there's an air of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=289.4s)]
*  optimism. And it's also coupled with this air of patriotism. Yeah, I haven't felt this surge of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=295.8s)]
*  patriotism in this country like this in a long, long time. And it is so welcome because Donald [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=302.36s)]
*  Trump actually loves the United States of America. And I think the majority of Americans, they love [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  this country. They don't want to be pushed around anymore. They don't want to be told that they're [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=314.44s)]
*  politically incorrect. They love the country. They love the flag. And they love Donald Trump [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  because he loves them too. And I think there's a reason why he plays Lee Greenwood's, Proud to Be [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  an American at every rally before he comes out. Real quickly, in just the time I've got left, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=329.48s)]
*  it's fascinating. I think not only is the optimism there, but so too is actual hard dollars. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=334.04s)]
*  All of the Silicon Valley billionaires coming to Mar-a-Lago giving money to the inauguration. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  You got to, I was covering the Mar-a-Lago beat as a reporter last week. Bezos came down there, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  the TikTok CEO and others. What do you think that says? They're paying the jackass tax. That's why. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=351.24s)]
*  They're doing the right thing and they're moving the right direction. But yeah, that's what it takes [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=359.96s)]
*  in order to get going in the right direction. Look, most important, it's great to support the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=364.84s)]
*  inauguration, but it's most important to put that investment, put America first, put Americans back [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  to work, manufacture your goods and services and do so right here in the United States. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=374.28s)]
*  Well, most important is having you, Jason Chaffetz. Join us this morning for the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=379.96s)]
*  Fox & Friends Christmas Morning. Thanks for being here and have a great Merry Christmas. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRWoKMSHXQ&t=384.36s)]
