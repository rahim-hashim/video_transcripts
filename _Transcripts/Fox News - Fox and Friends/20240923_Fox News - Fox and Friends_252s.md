# Israel strikes more than 300 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo)
*  I'd be joined by former IDF spokesperson Jonathan Konrikis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=0.0s)]
*  Jonathan, good morning to you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=4.04s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=5.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=6.72s)]
*  As Nate Foy was just talking about, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  apparently through surveillance, the IDF was able to see, hey, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=10.24s)]
*  look, they just launched a cruise missile out [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=14.16s)]
*  of somebody's house. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  You don't see that every day. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=19.2s)]
*  No, you don't. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  But in the coming days, I think you will see it more and more, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=23.2s)]
*  because that is the modus operandi of Hezbollah. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=26.0s)]
*  And that is what they have prepared for many years. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=29.48s)]
*  And southern Lebanon and many parts of central Lebanon [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=33.04s)]
*  and the southern parts of Beirut, the so-called Dakhia, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=36.56s)]
*  the Hezbollah-controlled area, these areas [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=40.32s)]
*  are literally full of locations where Hezbollah hides weapons [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=43.4s)]
*  inside what appears to be civilian houses. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=49.84s)]
*  And I can assure you that when once CNN and other networks will [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=53.16s)]
*  look like civilian houses again, and nobody will know that inside, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  weapons were stored and they were fired against Israel. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  But what really is happening here at the big level [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  is that Israel, on one hand, wants to return its civilians [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=69.08s)]
*  to their homes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=73.88s)]
*  And Israel is now presenting Hezbollah [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=75.12s)]
*  with a very simple choice. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=78.2s)]
*  It's either delink yourself from the situation in Gaza [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=80.08s)]
*  and decide not to continue to do the dirty work [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  of the Islamic Republic of Iran, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=88.56s)]
*  or protect and ensure the future stability of Lebanon. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=91.4s)]
*  You can't have both things. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=96.0s)]
*  You can't continue to be with Iran and have a safe Lebanon, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=97.44s)]
*  because if you continue to fire rockets at Israel, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=101.04s)]
*  that will come at a catastrophic cost for Lebanon. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  We're not there yet. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=107.84s)]
*  We're still messaging, and this is still on the brink. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  I don't think that neither Israel nor Hezbollah [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  has crossed that brink yet, but we are getting very, very close. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=114.64s)]
*  You know, Colonel, in your former capacity, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=118.4s)]
*  you had to be the diplomat, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  You were representing the military [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=123.56s)]
*  as well as representing the government. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=125.04s)]
*  And as we look at these live shots this morning, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=127.2s)]
*  it looks like the Middle East is on fire right now. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  What does this mean for America? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=132.84s)]
*  We got an election coming up. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=134.4s)]
*  You have an administration that has asked for restraint [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=136.12s)]
*  from Israel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=139.8s)]
*  You got Kamala Harris, who wants to be the next president, who [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=140.4s)]
*  is asking for more restraint. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=143.52s)]
*  If an American president and Kamala Harris is elected, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=146.28s)]
*  what is that going to mean for Israel? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=149.88s)]
*  I think that what our current situation now means for America [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=153.84s)]
*  is that America's most loyal ally in the Middle East, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=157.88s)]
*  that defends democracy and Western values, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=162.52s)]
*  that acts in order to enhance America's global standing [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=166.16s)]
*  and its regional power, that ally, Israel, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=171.28s)]
*  may be at the cusp of war, which will be a very, very difficult [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=174.52s)]
*  war for Israel to fight. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=178.8s)]
*  It'll be a war that Israel will defeat its enemies, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=180.6s)]
*  but it will be different from what we've had against Hamas, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=183.68s)]
*  because Hezbollah is way more powerful when [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=186.96s)]
*  it comes to weapons, capabilities, and personnel. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=190.16s)]
*  And the consequences for Israel will be dire. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=194.04s)]
*  The consequences for the region will be very severe. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=196.32s)]
*  And I think that from a simple American perspective, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=199.72s)]
*  it'll be an American ally fighting [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=202.92s)]
*  against a terrorist organization and against an enemy of America, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  which is Iran. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=209.32s)]
*  And I am confident, as an Israeli, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm confident that this time again, America [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=213.44s)]
*  will stand by Israel, whoever is elected, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  America will stand by Israel, because Israel [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  fights for democracy and freedom [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  against the powers of evil. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=223.12s)]
*  Yeah, we, all of us, support Israel. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  We are pro-Israel. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=229.08s)]
*  It's the Holy Land. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=230.32000000000002s)]
*  And you're seeing these images. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=231.8s)]
*  We're praying for you all. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  I hope that we can prevent an all-out war. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=234.72000000000003s)]
*  And I hope that's not where we're heading. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  Colonel, thank you so much for coming on with us. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNB2cqEbHo&t=239.32000000000002s)]
