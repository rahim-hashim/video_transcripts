# Gen. Jack Keane warns Hamas leader's death will not end war
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI)
*  Fox News alert you are looking at the final moments of Hamas leader and October 7th mastermind Yaya Sinwar [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=0.0s)]
*  Before being killed by an Israeli force drone and a chance encounter in Gaza [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin and Yahoo now indicating that could bring the end of the war [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=11.88s)]
*  After taking out many of the terrorist leaders credited with the last year of instability in the region [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=16.6s)]
*  But he's just could be the beginning of the end but not the end here to discuss his retired four-star general Fox News senior [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=21.2s)]
*  Strategic analyst and chairman of the Institute for the study of war general Jack Keane general [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=27.44s)]
*  We love that Sinwar is dead, but what does it mean for the mission of wiping out Hamas? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=31.96s)]
*  Well, certainly Sinwar is formidable figure [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=39.52s)]
*  I mean he's an iconic figure and the Israelis have been after him since day one as a major [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=42.32s)]
*  Military objective to achieve it and they and they have finally accomplished that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=49.08s)]
*  Certainly very comparable to killing Nasrallah, you know, who is the head of Hezbollah as well and the fact that Sinwar [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=53.64s)]
*  You know has absolutely been the major impediment to a hostage deal [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=60.76s)]
*  Certainly opens the possibility of that taking place depending on who his successor is and listen [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  I want to credit the eight to eighth brigade, you know a regular brigade in the Israeli IDF who took this guy down [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=73.36s)]
*  Following him into a building and hit him with a tank round the eight to eighth brigade [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=82.02s)]
*  Is the organization that killed those three Israeli hostages? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=86.86s)]
*  mistakenly so this is a major plus for an organization that certainly has been suffering under the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=91.58s)]
*  Heavy weight of that but those in the administration they're calling for [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  Sinwar's death is this is the opening to the end of the war. I mean that's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=101.86s)]
*  Proposterous giving the facts that are on the ground [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=108.02s)]
*  There's thousands of Hamas fighters still in Gaza not in organized battalions like they were [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=110.1s)]
*  but nonetheless a force that has to be dealt with and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=116.3s)]
*  Israel can't just walk away from that and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  Create some kind of post government where Hamas is there to challenge that government and challenge an international security forces [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  People again are rushing to premature judgments and not considering what the facts are really on the ground [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=131.18s)]
*  So they say the ISW says his brother Mohamed Sinwar gonna take over but the word is he got killed too [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=138.18s)]
*  So you said to me there the fighters are still there. They're just scattered and maybe unorganized. That's intolerable [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=144.5s)]
*  The Palestinian people have no shot at a legitimate at a government [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=150.9s)]
*  That's not a bunch of terrorists as long as Hamas is there so calling for a ceasefire [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=154.18s)]
*  Seems somewhat irresponsible but getting calling for a surrender and a release of all the hostages seems to make more sense [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=160.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think there is an opening here on the hostages depending on [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=169.62s)]
*  Who takes over if it's one of the political leaders in? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=174.66s)]
*  Qatar and three or four of them are there and that becomes the new leader of Hamas [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=178.54s)]
*  They were they clearly had disagreed [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=184.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, which Sin was obstinance and maybe that door will open and you'll be able to get the hostages out [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  My Israeli sources tell me of the 101 hostages 48 are confirmed dead and they certainly want to get the rest of them out [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=193.17999999999998s)]
*  Of there because they longer they stay there [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=201.14s)]
*  Obviously their lives are in jeopardy and we've seen the evidence of all of that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=202.94s)]
*  So that would be a good thing [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=206.82s)]
*  But Prime Minister Netanyahu is not going to agree to a permanent ceasefire here when he's got thousands of fighters still in Gaza to deal [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=208.29999999999998s)]
*  With and he certainly has Hezbollah and he's dismantling that organization right before our eyes every single day [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=216.28s)]
*  So the fact that sin was death is going to end the war [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=222.8s)]
*  The conditions are not there to arrive at that conclusion [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  Oh, that's premature wishful thinking that we've had from the administration from a long time [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=231.66s)]
*  And I think the Prime Minister got to ignore it the Iranian diplomatic efforts are in full gear [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=237.12s)]
*  For the first time since 2014 their foreign minister went to Egypt [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=242.0s)]
*  They would know they went to Saudi Arabia. They are true. They are scared to death. It seems of a Iranian [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=245.12s)]
*  Israeli attack and they know they have never been more vulnerable final thought on that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  Well the Iranians I said time and again they are back on their heels [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=257.4s)]
*  They're watching the dismantling of their two most powerful proxies Hezbollah and Hamas all the leaders in both of these [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=261.8s)]
*  Organizations have have been killed [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=268.88s)]
*  They've conducted two massive missile attacks on Israel that have been [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=270.52000000000004s)]
*  Inconsequential and they know full well that where they are today is not where they thought they would be when October the 7th started [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  So they are back on their heels and they are vulnerable [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drc-sdP5jZI&t=283.04s)]
