# Tom Homan responds to Gavin Newsom's 'dare' to arrest him: 'No one's above the law'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8)
*  So anti-ice rioters in LA blocking the highway and setting fire to the city in protest of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump administration's illegal immigration crackdown. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=6.76s)]
*  Jonathan Hunt is live outside of the Metro Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles with [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=10.4s)]
*  the latest. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=15.24s)]
*  Jonathan? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Ainsley, Lawrence, Brian, good morning to all of you once again. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we're outside the Metropolitan Detention Center right here in downtown LA. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=21.44s)]
*  Still a very tense scene on the streets here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=26.32s)]
*  You can see the police cars lined up as they are at various intersections all around downtown [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=29.34s)]
*  LA right now as a result of what we have witnessed over the last few days. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=35.74s)]
*  It all began, of course, on Friday with those ice raids targeting illegal immigrants. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=40.82s)]
*  That sparked the initial protests that we saw here. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=46.82s)]
*  And then on Saturday there was even more protest sparked by ice activity in the city. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=51.1s)]
*  Paramount, that's about 25 miles south of downtown LA. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=58.94s)]
*  And with the protesters then clashing with federal agents, President Trump said he would [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=64.25999999999999s)]
*  call in the National Guard, federalizing members of the National Guard here in California and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=70.34s)]
*  sending them to LA. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=76.08s)]
*  By Sunday morning, they were on the streets of LA in their hundreds and thousands of protesters [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=78.24s)]
*  turned out to greet them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=86.46s)]
*  That's when things turned, of course, extremely violent. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=88.34s)]
*  We saw the American flag burned. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=91.26s)]
*  We saw Waymo, which are the robo-taxis, the self-driving taxis. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=93.5s)]
*  They're a common sight on the streets of LA. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=98.58s)]
*  Set on fire, at least three of them very close to the 101 freeway, which was completely shut [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=101.58s)]
*  down in both directions for a time because of those thousands of protesters. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  They were met with smoke grenades, tear gas and some rubber bullet rounds fired by law [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=113.22000000000001s)]
*  enforcement. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=119.66000000000001s)]
*  The LAPD was on scene heavily on Sunday, having been criticized for a slow response on Friday. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=120.66000000000001s)]
*  And President Trump said having sent the National Guard in here, he would be perfectly willing [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=128.14000000000001s)]
*  to send a lot more troops if necessary. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=133.58s)]
*  Here's the president. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=136.78s)]
*  What is the bar for sending Marines? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=137.78s)]
*  That's what I think it is. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=141.9s)]
*  I mean, if we see danger to our country and to our citizens, we'll be very, very strong [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=142.9s)]
*  in terms of law and order. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  It's about law and order. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=149.06s)]
*  That's apricot leaf on the feeble, sir. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=150.06s)]
*  Secretary, how do we... [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=153.46s)]
*  We've got to see what we need. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=154.46s)]
*  We'll send whatever we need to make sure that it's law and order. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=155.46s)]
*  Now, California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote in protest to the president and also posted [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=158.98000000000002s)]
*  saying, quote, I have formally requested the Trump administration rescind their unlawful [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=167.94s)]
*  deployment of troops in Los Angeles County and return them to my command. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=173.3s)]
*  I think the answer we can safely say to that is going to be a flat no from President Trump. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=179.18s)]
*  He in fact has indicated he is willing to keep the National Guard here and bolster their [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=185.1s)]
*  ranks for up to 60 days if he feels it is necessary. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=190.26s)]
*  I can also tell you guys there is another protest plan to gather in Grand Park just [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=195.01999999999998s)]
*  a couple of blocks from where I am right now at 11 a.m. local time today. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  That's 2 p.m. Eastern time. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  So those protesters are not letting up either. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=207.5s)]
*  This is going to remain an extremely tense situation on the streets of Los Angeles. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=210.7s)]
*  Lawrence Ainsley, Brian. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=216.82s)]
*  Jonathan, any sense of how many of these protesters are illegals? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=217.82s)]
*  Do you get the sense that this is... [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=221.89999999999998s)]
*  Good question. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  Is this is illegals trying to stay here or do you think it's just people creating anarchy? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=225.26s)]
*  I think you have a complete mixture of all of those things. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=231.9s)]
*  Frankly, Brian, I think a lot of illegal immigrants would not be showing up to these protests [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=235.38s)]
*  simply because of the danger they would face of arrest. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=241.78s)]
*  I think what you have are a lot of supporters of those illegal immigrants, a lot of pro-immigration [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  activists, and then as the LAPD chief, Jim McDonald himself said, you have a lot of people [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=252.38000000000002s)]
*  who have very little to do with the cause of immigration but are here simply because [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=258.78000000000003s)]
*  this is, in the words of the LAPD chief, what they do. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=265.26s)]
*  They turn up for these protests and riots. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  They turned up for the George Floyd protests and riots. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  They've turned up for the anti-Wall Street protests and riots. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=275.58000000000004s)]
*  According to the police chief, they see a lot of the same faces turning up, organizing [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=278.94s)]
*  here and according to the police chief, they are the ones engaging in most of the violence [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=284.58000000000004s)]
*  over the last few days, Brian. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=290.7s)]
*  Well, yeah, because there was never any consequences. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=292.38s)]
*  Thanks, Jonathan. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=294.78000000000003s)]
*  In 2020, they never got arrested. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  There was no criminal prosecution. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=299.18s)]
*  They were part-partied. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=301.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=302.62s)]
*  So you got the same people showing up to every movement with the Kofi'ish. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=303.62s)]
*  And it's yet again the same people that are marking in the middle of the street. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=307.66s)]
*  You got the COVID masks that are on as well. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=310.86s)]
*  And they say they're afraid of the police, remember, but they're throwing bricks at them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=314.22s)]
*  They're setting stuff on fire. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=318.02000000000004s)]
*  This doesn't look like people that are afraid of the police. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=319.26000000000005s)]
*  These are people that feel empowered. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=322.14000000000004s)]
*  This is why the president has to crack down and deal with it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=324.14000000000004s)]
*  Gavin Newsom has had years to deal with these people and they've been free to do whatever [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=327.18s)]
*  they want. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=332.5s)]
*  And now the hammer is being dropped. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=333.5s)]
*  Well, it's the Democrats that have demonized ICE agents, called them fascists. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=334.9s)]
*  And so the individuals hear that, they go out and protest. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=338.78s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=342.86s)]
*  You would think that the governor would want federal agents or troops, National Guard, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=344.34s)]
*  to be sent in to help his police officers because the LA police chief said, we're overwhelmed. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=350.5s)]
*  They're using cinder blocks and hammers. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=355.66s)]
*  They're throwing these at our cars and our police officers that we've even had liquid [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=357.22s)]
*  who knows what thrown at our officers. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=361.3s)]
*  They shut down the 101 freeway. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=363.7s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=365.46s)]
*  Meanwhile, it's become mini Mexico. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=366.46s)]
*  That's why the flags, these people are proud of it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=369.09999999999997s)]
*  They don't understand that it's hurting their cause, but they're not thinking about that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=371.3s)]
*  And now Gavin Newsom wants to sue Donald Trump. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=374.78s)]
*  That's supposed to come down to that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=377.46s)]
*  And he's trying to stop, yeah, he's trying to stop the whole presence of the National [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=379.14s)]
*  Guard. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=382.34s)]
*  So violent anti-ICE protests raging across LA, burning US flags, setting cars on fire [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=383.34s)]
*  at the police to protest the arrest of illegal migrants, including child abuse and murder [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=390.06s)]
*  suspects. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=395.98s)]
*  But California Democrats like Kamala Harris, Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Newsom are blaming [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=396.98s)]
*  the Trump administration for the chaos. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=402.14s)]
*  Borders of our time home and joins us now. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=405.22s)]
*  So Tom, you've been leading these operations. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=407.5s)]
*  And so instead of criticizing the people that are attacking our agents, you got Gavin Newsom [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=410.78s)]
*  who has called for you to arrest him. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=418.42s)]
*  And you got Maxine Waters, who is going after the National Guard. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=420.66s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=425.54s)]
*  He's a tough guy. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=426.54s)]
*  Why doesn't he do that? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=427.54s)]
*  He knows where to find me. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=428.54s)]
*  The hell is this guy? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=429.54s)]
*  Come after me, arrest me. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=431.5s)]
*  Let's just get it over with. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=432.7s)]
*  Tough guy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=434.1s)]
*  You know, I don't give a damn. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=435.1s)]
*  But I care about my community. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=437.74s)]
*  And I'm sorry to be so clear, but that kind of bloviating is exhausting. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=439.24s)]
*  So Tom, arrest me. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=443.5s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=446.5s)]
*  Shoot some kid? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=447.62s)]
*  He's afraid of you and what? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=448.62s)]
*  You're going to shoot an elected official? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=449.62s)]
*  If you shoot me, you better shoot straight. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=451.62s)]
*  I don't know why you're in my city. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=454.62s)]
*  The governor was not contacted. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=459.62s)]
*  Tom, what's your response? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=461.62s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's just ridiculous. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=464.62s)]
*  That reporter from SMEC, he's a joke. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=467.54s)]
*  He's a dishonest reporter. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=471.54s)]
*  What we discussed was for those protesters that crossed the line, I've said it many times, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=473.9s)]
*  you can protest, you get your first-matter rights. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=477.85999999999996s)]
*  But when you cross that line, you put hands on a ICE officer or you destroy property. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=479.85999999999996s)]
*  I'd say that you're a Pied law enforcement or you're knowingly harboring a concealed [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=485.85999999999996s)]
*  evil handling. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=489.94s)]
*  That's a crime. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=490.94s)]
*  And the Trump administration is not going to tolerate it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=491.94s)]
*  You cross that line, we're going to see you prosecute me to the Department of Justice. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=494.09999999999997s)]
*  Then the reporter asked me, well, could the governor notice some of it or Mayor Bass [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=497.41999999999996s)]
*  be arrested? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=501.21999999999997s)]
*  I said, well, no one's above the law. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=502.21999999999997s)]
*  And he said, well, if they cross the line and commit a crime, absolutely they can. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=504.18s)]
*  So there was no discussion about resting in New South. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=507.18s)]
*  And what he's done, he's failed that state. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=509.18s)]
*  He waited two days of that city burning and people getting hurt, officers being assaulted [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=513.1800000000001s)]
*  before he made any declaration of an unlawful assembly. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=519.1800000000001s)]
*  He's late to the game. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=523.1800000000001s)]
*  President Trump isn't late to the game. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=525.1800000000001s)]
*  Men and women are not late to the game. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=527.1800000000001s)]
*  And let's make this clear. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=529.1800000000001s)]
*  What happened with this, with how this riot started is that ICE was serving a series of [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=531.8199999999999s)]
*  criminal warrants at a business being investigated for money laundering, customer fraud, and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=537.3399999999999s)]
*  serious violations on sending money to criminal cartels in Colombia, Mexico. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=543.8199999999999s)]
*  That fund cartel activities in the United States is part of an overall conspiracy that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=550.6999999999999s)]
*  ICE is investigating. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=555.4599999999999s)]
*  So we're arresting bad people. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=556.4599999999999s)]
*  We're enforcing laws and following up on a serious criminal investigation on cartel financing. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=559.14s)]
*  So that's exactly what ICE did. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=563.14s)]
*  And ICE took a lot of bad people off the street that day. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=565.14s)]
*  We arrested a sexual predator, arrested gang members, arrested somebody that had an armed [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=567.14s)]
*  robbery conviction. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=571.14s)]
*  So we made LA safer. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=572.14s)]
*  The men and women of ICE, the men and women of the border joke, made LA safer that day. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=574.14s)]
*  But you're not hearing any of this. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=579.14s)]
*  All you hear is a rhetoric about ICE being racist and ICE being Nazis and terrorists. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=580.14s)]
*  And Governor Newsom feeds that. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=584.14s)]
*  Just like Hakeem Jeffrey feeds it, that he's going to unmask ICE agents. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=586.62s)]
*  And the members of Congress who keep feeding this Reddit, they're the ones that are causing [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=590.62s)]
*  this riot because they don't listen to the truth about what the men and women of ICE [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=595.62s)]
*  are doing. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=600.62s)]
*  We're keeping our promise to American people to make these streets safe again. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=601.62s)]
*  And that's exactly what we're going to do. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=603.62s)]
*  And we're not going to stop doing it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=605.62s)]
*  Tom, who gave the stand down order from the LAPD? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=607.62s)]
*  When your federal agents were being surrounded, and you know the call, you were a local cop [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=612.1s)]
*  before you were a federal agent, when a cop says officer assist across the radio that [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=617.1s)]
*  they're surrounded, everyone in the surrounding area is supposed to respond. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=622.1s)]
*  So who told the LA cops not to respond? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=626.1s)]
*  Well, the LA police chief, he works for the mayor of Los Angeles. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=631.1s)]
*  That's Karen Bass. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=635.1s)]
*  And they were very delayed in responding to the call for assistance. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=637.1s)]
*  I was here and they had over a thousand protesters at the fellow bone. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=641.58s)]
*  And they breached it several times. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=645.58s)]
*  Luckily, they were able to push them back. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=647.58s)]
*  And that put the officers at great risk. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=648.58s)]
*  It put the detainees that we had in custody at great risk. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=650.58s)]
*  So again, this is just a false narrative being pushed by the left and being pushed by even [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=653.58s)]
*  members of Congress about the men and women of ICE being Nazis and terrorists and that [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=658.58s)]
*  were outrating, arresting innocent women and children. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=664.58s)]
*  Everybody we arrested, everybody we looked for, they got a final order removed. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=667.58s)]
*  They had to do process. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=671.0600000000001s)]
*  That's what he was shouting about. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=672.0600000000001s)]
*  They didn't man do process. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=673.0600000000001s)]
*  They had to do process. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=674.0600000000001s)]
*  A judge, a federal judge, has ordered them removed. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=675.0600000000001s)]
*  Our job is to execute that order. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=678.0600000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=680.0600000000001s)]
*  So you got Congress who made the laws that we're following. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=681.0600000000001s)]
*  You have a judge that orders them removed. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=684.0600000000001s)]
*  So we're executing removal orders. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=686.0600000000001s)]
*  ICE is doing the job that American people want them to do. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=688.0600000000001s)]
*  We're making America safe again. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=691.0600000000001s)]
*  One illegal criminal at a time. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=692.0600000000001s)]
*  And that's what we're doing in LA. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=694.0600000000001s)]
*  So Tom, the travel ban is set to go into effect today. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=696.54s)]
*  Over a dozen countries are on that list, including the Venezuelan nationals. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=699.54s)]
*  Tell me about this travel ban. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=704.54s)]
*  What is it going to do to stop the travel coming across this country to illegal immigrants? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=706.54s)]
*  Before I go on that, let me just mention this. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=711.54s)]
*  You know, God bless President Trump for sending the National Guard. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=714.54s)]
*  The National Guard here to protect property, protect life, protect our officers and protect [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=717.54s)]
*  civilians. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=722.54s)]
*  This city's burning, it's out of control because of the weak leadership of Democrats here in [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=724.02s)]
*  the state and frankly in United States Congress. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=728.02s)]
*  So I salute President Trump for sending the National Guard to protect life and property. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=732.02s)]
*  And the travel ban is exactly what should be doing. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=737.02s)]
*  And the countries that are being targeted on this do not do proper vetting before the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=739.02s)]
*  issues, issue visas come to this country. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=743.02s)]
*  This is about protecting America. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=746.02s)]
*  We spent four years ago, two million known gotaways. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=748.02s)]
*  How many of them came from a terrorist country that sponsors terrorism? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=751.5s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=754.5s)]
*  President Trump is taking every step possible to protect this nation from a terrorist attack [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=755.5s)]
*  and from other criminal activity that crosses our border and comes into the visa program. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=760.5s)]
*  So this is definitely making these countries step up and do the right thing. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=765.5s)]
*  When you send someone to give them a visa and they enter the United States, we want [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=768.5s)]
*  proper vetting them before they come here. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=772.5s)]
*  That's what this is about. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=774.5s)]
*  Tom, I got only a few seconds left, but I got to get your reaction to Kilmar Obrego Garcia. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=775.5s)]
*  They wanted him back. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=780.98s)]
*  They got him back, but he's been indicted on two counts. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=781.98s)]
*  One kind of conspiracy of unlawful transport of illegal alien for financial gain, maximum [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=784.9s)]
*  imprisonment, 10 years. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=789.78s)]
*  You got a count to unlawful transportation of an illegal alien for financial gain. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=792.02s)]
*  How serious are these charges? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=796.42s)]
*  Real quick. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=797.82s)]
*  They're real serious. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=798.82s)]
*  We're going to work back. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=799.82s)]
*  We're going to criminally prosecute. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=800.82s)]
*  We're going to put him in prison. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=801.82s)]
*  And when he gets done with his prison sentence, he can be deported right back to his homeland. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=802.82s)]
*  Tom Homan, thank you so much. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=807.82s)]
*  You got it. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg1jZEWxi8&t=810.5s)]
