# Peter Doocy: Unless Zelenskyy makes a public apology, all bets are off
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To)
*  Tulsi Gabbard, she's thanking Trump for his unwavering [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=0.0s)]
*  leadership, especially with the Zelensky situation [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=4.84s)]
*  and the showdown in the Oval Office. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=8.44s)]
*  Let's listen to what Tulsi has to say about that showdown. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=11.58s)]
*  Oh, actually, it's a post. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=16.16s)]
*  So I just saw a video of her talking about it, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=17.0s)]
*  so I thought we were putting that up, but here's the post. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=19.16s)]
*  She says, thank you, at Real Donald Trump, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=21.72s)]
*  for unwavering leadership and standing up [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=23.6s)]
*  for the interests of the American people and peace. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=25.52s)]
*  What you said is absolutely true. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=29.04s)]
*  Zelensky has been trying to drag the United States [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=31.4s)]
*  into a nuclear war with Russia, World War III, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=33.94s)]
*  four years now, and no one has ever called him out on it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=37.2s)]
*  Thank you, Vice President JD Vance, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=41.42s)]
*  for speaking out so forcefully and clearly [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=42.96s)]
*  about the necessity of diplomacy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Shannon, she also posted a video talking about how [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=49.28s)]
*  Zelensky basically banned his opposition [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=52.92s)]
*  and seized all of that person's assets. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=56.7s)]
*  So she's definitely not a fan of a lot of people [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=60.06s)]
*  agreeing with that message. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=62.5s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=63.540000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, she's been very critical of President Zelensky [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=64.38s)]
*  for a long time, and she has said from the beginning [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=66.82000000000001s)]
*  that Russia had what she saw as legitimate concerns [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=70.58s)]
*  about Ukraine joining NATO, then NATO being right there [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=74.38s)]
*  on the border with Russia. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=77.34s)]
*  And I'm gonna probe with her this morning, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=79.34s)]
*  because she's gonna join us this morning, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=80.7s)]
*  her first Sunday show, doing Fox News Sunday, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=81.82000000000001s)]
*  since becoming the DNI. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=83.92s)]
*  What does she feel now, about who started this, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=85.66s)]
*  how it's supposed to end? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=88.86s)]
*  She's been very critical of Ukraine and Zelensky [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=90.58s)]
*  as a leader, so I think there are a lot of questions [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=92.66s)]
*  there to get answered. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  Clearly, she thought what happened in the Oval Office [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=96.58s)]
*  on Friday was President Trump showing strength, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=99.12s)]
*  and a lot of people feel that way, as awkward as it got, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=102.82s)]
*  that Americans have been pouring billions of taxpayer dollars [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=105.98s)]
*  into Ukraine with no end in sight, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=108.78s)]
*  and a lot of people here in America were sort of ready [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=111.74s)]
*  for what happened there on Friday, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=113.86s)]
*  and felt like it was a good thing, and she's among them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=115.38s)]
*  And Shannon, we talked about this for four hours yesterday. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=117.42s)]
*  After the show, I heard from somebody on the Trump team [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=121.02s)]
*  who was in the room for these negotiations, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=124.34s)]
*  and was talking about how something that is lost [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=126.82s)]
*  in all of this is that it started out so warmly, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=129.94s)]
*  but that now, moving forward, unless, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=134.02s)]
*  what I'm told by this person, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=137.54s)]
*  it's ultimately up to President Trump, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=139.26s)]
*  but that at this point, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=141.86s)]
*  unless Zelensky makes an explicit public apology, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=143.94000000000003s)]
*  then all bets are off for this mineral deal, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=148.14000000000001s)]
*  and things are just gonna be at a standstill. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=151.3s)]
*  What do you think is more important [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=154.54000000000002s)]
*  to the White House at this point? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=156.26000000000002s)]
*  Meeting President Trump's goal of ending the war [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=157.94000000000003s)]
*  within 100 days, his first 100 days, which is April 30th, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=162.26000000000002s)]
*  or just exacting this apology [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=166.10000000000002s)]
*  and a mineral deal from Zelensky? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=170.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think ultimately he does. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=172.74s)]
*  Peter, as you said, he wants to get this done. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=174.38s)]
*  He campaigned on this, on ending this. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=176.29999999999998s)]
*  He talks about the constant bloodshed on both sides, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=178.06s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people gone forever [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=180.9s)]
*  from their families and from the future of that country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=184.46s)]
*  I think he's a deal-maker. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=187.5s)]
*  I think we all know that at the end of the day, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  he wants to get this thing done, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=190.22s)]
*  and he's started to feel like this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  White House has started to feel like [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=193.54s)]
*  Zelensky is a roadblock to getting that done. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=194.7s)]
*  There's also been a lot of growing frustration [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=198.12s)]
*  that I've heard from folks who have been [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=200.06s)]
*  in some of these meetings, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=201.22s)]
*  and some of this has been discussed publicly as well, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=202.14s)]
*  meetings with people like Secretary Besant, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  Vice President Vance, and Secretary Rubio, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=206.82s)]
*  having conversations with Zelensky [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=210.45999999999998s)]
*  that have been very heated, trying to move things forward, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  and then coming out in some cases [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=215.98s)]
*  feeling like what he said with them privately [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=218.06s)]
*  was then misrepresented as something else publicly. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  So this wasn't like this just blew up on Friday. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=223.12s)]
*  You guys know that this has been building for a while. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=225.66s)]
*  Before we get to what else you have going on [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  on the show today, you've been covering Washington [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=230.5s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=232.94s)]
*  Do you ever remember a more sort of explosive, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=233.89999999999998s)]
*  a public open meeting in the White House [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=238.1s)]
*  than what we saw on Friday? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=242.73999999999998s)]
*  Definitely not in the Oval. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=244.33999999999997s)]
*  I think we all know this is how these guys [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  talk to each other behind closed doors. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=247.89999999999998s)]
*  I think we all expect that it's gonna get rough and tumble. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  They're going to raise their voices. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=251.89999999999998s)]
*  They're gonna have arguments. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  But for it to spill out so publicly [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=254.5s)]
*  after all of these other foreign visits this week [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=256.54s)]
*  with Macron and with Stammer that were very diplomatic, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  and they have differences with President Trump for sure, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=261.58000000000004s)]
*  but they were very effusive in their praise [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  while they're on US soil sitting in the Oval Office. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=266.38s)]
*  So it was a little bit stunning [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=268.78000000000003s)]
*  that this thing devolved to the way it did. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=270.56s)]
*  And I cannot say I've seen anything like that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  at the White House ever. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=274.70000000000005s)]
*  But what is the impact of that? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=275.72s)]
*  Do you think that it's an overall good, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=277.54s)]
*  like it's transparency, we're seeing what's done, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=279.62s)]
*  American people can see Zelensky as he is, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=282.02000000000004s)]
*  like him or not? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=284.46000000000004s)]
*  Or do you think that this is not a good thing? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=285.9s)]
*  What is your view, as Charlie said, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=287.82s)]
*  having had this experience? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=289.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I felt very cringe as it was happening. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=291.09999999999997s)]
*  I happened to be at the White House [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  for a completely separate meeting [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  that did not involve this. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=295.9s)]
*  And when I walked out of the meeting, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  this had just gone down and it was like shell shock [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpyWFsHq2To&t=298.17999999999995s)]
