# Trump hits 'weak' Mark Cuban for comments about female supporters: He’s ‘insecure’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk)
*  Nobody's been better to Puerto Rico than me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=0.0s)]
*  I saved Puerto Rico when they had some of the worst hurricanes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=2.7s)]
*  Really bad. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  I brought in the hospital ship, the Mercy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=8.14s)]
*  I brought in this massive hospital ship I brought. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=10.94s)]
*  There's nobody, and Puerto Ricans will tell you that, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=13.84s)]
*  nobody's done more for Puerto Rico than me. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=16.54s)]
*  They made this one comedian telling one little joke [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=19.18s)]
*  early in the show when nobody had even started [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=21.98s)]
*  going into the arena practically. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=24.52s)]
*  They made this comedian, and they made the whole weekend, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  and they took out this gorgeous, unbelievable, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=30.48s)]
*  patriotic evening, and they sort of stained it a little bit [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=34.28s)]
*  by a comedian that I have no idea who he is. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=38.900000000000006s)]
*  He's a man that was put there by very good people [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=41.46s)]
*  and well-meaning people. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=44.5s)]
*  He mentioned Puerto Rico, and they made it like a big deal. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=45.900000000000006s)]
*  These are professional people. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=48.8s)]
*  And I always say, if they would use that genius, okay, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=51.7s)]
*  because their genius for doing bad is quite good, actually, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=55.36000000000001s)]
*  if they would use that to make America great again, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=59.300000000000004s)]
*  we would have the greatest country. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=62.68000000000001s)]
*  It would be so nice, and everybody would love them, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=64.28s)]
*  but they don't. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=67.28s)]
*  It doesn't look like turning that comedian's joke [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=68.64s)]
*  into three days of a news cycle actually worked. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=71.58000000000001s)]
*  The Hispanic polling, which we can show on the screen, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=74.18s)]
*  is definitely trending in your direction [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=76.48s)]
*  versus Kamala Harris, the way that voters, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=78.56s)]
*  Latino voters are looking to go. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=82.06s)]
*  But speaking of demographics, by the way, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=83.62s)]
*  Rachel and I were there at Madison Square Garden that night. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=86.18s)]
*  We saw firsthand the environment. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=87.92s)]
*  We saw firsthand the crowd. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=89.48s)]
*  They're looking at demographics, Mr. President. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=92.42s)]
*  They're looking at shaving off. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  We talked about Latinos. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=95.86s)]
*  They're looking at women. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=97.30000000000001s)]
*  Pete mentioned we were diners this week. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=100.14s)]
*  I was in Georgia at a diner, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=102.0s)]
*  and women talked about the economy, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=103.10000000000001s)]
*  which you were just talking about. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=104.38000000000001s)]
*  But what they wanna talk to women about is, I don't know, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=105.48s)]
*  the handmaid's tale. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  They wanna make them think they should be afraid [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=110.44s)]
*  of their husbands. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=112.04s)]
*  I want you to watch this ad that features Julia Roberts. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=113.16s)]
*  You can vote any way you want. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=118.8s)]
*  And no one will ever know. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=123.6s)]
*  Did you make the right choice? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=124.88s)]
*  Sure did, honey. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=129.24s)]
*  It's about women lying to their husbands. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  They're actually voting for Kamala. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=133.12s)]
*  Mark Cuban has suggested you don't surround yourself [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=134.76s)]
*  with strong, independent, intelligent women. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=137.08s)]
*  What is your message to women? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=139.62s)]
*  Well, I know Mark very well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=141.78s)]
*  He's a very insecure guy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=143.52s)]
*  Can't hit a golf ball more than 50 yards. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=144.78s)]
*  He's weak physically and mentally, as far as I'm concerned. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=147.12s)]
*  But I've known him for a long time. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  He would call me in the White House incessantly. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=151.76s)]
*  And finally, I just couldn't take his calls anymore. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=154.56s)]
*  And then he went over to the other side. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=156.8s)]
*  And he's a guy that wants publicity. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=158.96s)]
*  When he said that, and you know, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=162.5s)]
*  he's totally retracted his statement, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=164.5s)]
*  like weak people always do. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=166.3s)]
*  They retract their statements. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=167.78s)]
*  But he was hit by some of the strongest, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=170.34s)]
*  not human beings, women. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=173.94s)]
*  He was hit by the strongest people [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=176.28s)]
*  that it wasn't men, women. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  It was women. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=180.88s)]
*  He was hit by women that make men look like babies. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=182.17999999999998s)]
*  Because you know many of the women that I deal with [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=186.72s)]
*  and that I have, and I could go over the list, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  but the list is long, including the fact [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=193.26s)]
*  that I happened to be married to a rather strong woman [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=195.92s)]
*  who just right now is the number one bestseller [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=198.9s)]
*  in the whole wide world in her book, Melania. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=201.04s)]
*  So no, I've surrounded myself with women. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=204.98s)]
*  I've given women chances too. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=207.72s)]
*  I mean, I had Kellyanne as the head of my 2016 big victory. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=209.76s)]
*  Suzy Wiles is strong. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=215.92s)]
*  You know, she's the daughter of Pat Summerall, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=217.32s)]
*  Good genetics there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=219.72s)]
*  And I have tremendously struggled. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=222.22s)]
*  In fact, I've been actually accused of the other. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=224.48s)]
*  They said, couldn't it be like, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=226.88s)]
*  couldn't you get women that aren't as strong? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=228.18s)]
*  I have more problems the other way [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=230.9s)]
*  until Mark Cuban came along. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=232.14s)]
*  But you know, Mark, I'm so disappointed at Julia Roberts [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=233.54s)]
*  because I look, and she's gonna look back on that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=236.74s)]
*  and she's gonna cringe that, did I really say that? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't say much for her relationship, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=242.62s)]
*  but I'm sure she has a great relationship. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  But wives and husbands, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  I don't think that's the way they deal. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=248.96s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine a wife not telling a husband [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  who she's voting for? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=252.72s)]
*  Do you ever hear anything like that? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=253.56s)]
*  Even if you have a horrible, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=254.96s)]
*  if you had a bad relationship, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=257.52s)]
*  you're gonna tell your husband, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=258.56s)]
*  it's a ridiculous thing, it's so stupid. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=259.88s)]
*  She's gonna look back some days and say, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=262.08s)]
*  did I really make that? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, they're into this thing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=265.12s)]
*  Look, I'm running against the worst candidate [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=266.84s)]
*  probably ever put up by a major party. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=269.56s)]
*  She's grossly incompetent. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=271.68s)]
*  She can't put two sentences together. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=274.32s)]
*  And you take a look at the 60-minute piece, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=276.58s)]
*  seriously, look at the answers she gave. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=278.32s)]
*  And now we wanna see, by the way, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=280.68s)]
*  whether or not they did that with other answers [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=282.06s)]
*  and they refused to give us the papers. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  So we should, you know, I'm doing it for the people, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=286.0s)]
*  but somebody has to do it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  ABC is, I've always said, very corrupt. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  They asked me during the debate, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  this guy, what's his name? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  Asked me so many questions, just always questions. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=297.3s)]
*  He said, no, crime is down. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  I said, no, crime is up. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=302.44s)]
*  Crime is down, I'm sorry. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=303.56s)]
*  Crime is down. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=305.44s)]
*  David Muir, he said, crime is down. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=306.40000000000003s)]

*  because the news is an embarrassment to our country. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=331.78s)]
*  And you look at the Washington Post, it's going bust. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=335.21999999999997s)]

*  and you talk about the bad job numbers and all of that. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=490.96s)]
*  The worst job, I'll tell you what, it is a gift to me. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=493.4s)]
*  I finally got a gift. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=496.66s)]
*  I'm running against two people that just put out [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=498.8s)]

*  the biggest deal, economically the biggest thing [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=506.12s)]
*  that happened. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=508.4s)]
*  They came out five days before an election. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=509.76s)]
*  Think of that, I finally got a gift. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=514.2s)]
*  I hope people realize how bad this is. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=516.42s)]
*  They're the worst numbers ever, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=518.9s)]
*  but the Hispanic people are incredible people. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=520.98s)]
*  But I just saw it, I was shocked to see it [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=523.3000000000001s)]
*  because Fox never gives me good polls, never. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=525.0600000000001s)]
*  They should get a new pollster because they're always wrong. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=527.84s)]
*  But I just saw a poll, I assume it was a Fox poll, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=530.4s)]
*  where I'm leading with Hispanics. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=533.9s)]
*  If you go back and look at Mitt Romney, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=536.02s)]
*  there's another real beauty, by the way, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=538.08s)]
*  go back and look at Mitt Romney and what did he have? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=539.9s)]
*  Like 5% of the Hispanic vote or something? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=542.3000000000001s)]
*  And they had me down at what, 51 or something, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=545.16s)]
*  51, 52%. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=548.16s)]
*  I was substantially leading a Democrat with Hispanic voters [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=550.4s)]
*  and look at how well we're doing [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=555.72s)]
*  with the African American population. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uywSRyNJOk&t=558.12s)]
