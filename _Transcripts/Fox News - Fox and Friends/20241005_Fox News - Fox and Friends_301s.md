# ‘NOT OVER YET’: NC native sheds light on Helene’s fury
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8)
*  Today, former President Trump returns to the site of his first assassination attempt in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=0.0s)]
*  Butler, Pennsylvania, where he'll honor the life of firefighter Corey Comparatore. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=9.18s)]
*  Our next guest was in the crowd directly behind Trump on that day. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=14.68s)]
*  You can see her there and she'll speak at today's rally. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=18.66s)]
*  Pete is live in Butler, Pennsylvania with Renee White this morning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=23.14s)]
*  Pete. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=26.3s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=27.3s)]
*  Hey, Will and Rachel, thanks for that. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=28.580000000000002s)]
*  We are here with Renee White. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=29.94s)]
*  You saw her in that shot wearing the similar or same t-shirt. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=31.64s)]
*  Well, not the same. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=35.22s)]
*  I bought four of them because I got tired of going to gas stations and washing them [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=36.46s)]
*  out in the sink and then drying them out my window to get to the next rally. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=40.42s)]
*  But that was 32. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=44.34s)]
*  This is 47 and Trump's going to be 47. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=45.68s)]
*  So 47 rallies for you. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=48.58s)]
*  Seven rallies for me. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=51.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=52.22s)]
*  What's it like to be back here? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=53.22s)]
*  This one's different. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=54.52s)]
*  You were, you spoke to our own Lawrence Jones the next morning as well because you'd slept [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=55.52s)]
*  in your car. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=59.1s)]
*  You're sort of like, hey, I don't know what's going on here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=60.1s)]
*  What's it like to be back? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=61.980000000000004s)]
*  So to be back is kind of crazy. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=63.14s)]
*  It was surreal to come back into town and it's almost like a bittersweet. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=64.82000000000001s)]
*  Like you're so happy and excited to be back here and to finish what we started and to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=68.7s)]
*  fight and to be here together and to have the unity to let Trump know we have his back [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=73.22s)]
*  like he has ours. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=77.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=78.9s)]
*  So we want all of that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=79.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=81.06s)]
*  So to come back here was absolutely crazy because like as I came into town, it was [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=82.06s)]
*  an eerie feeling to drive by the place that I parked, to go down the street that I went [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=85.7s)]
*  through the town and went fight, fight, fight. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=90.5s)]
*  And you know, we'll never surrender and you know, let's fight harder. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=92.94s)]
*  And people were giving me fist bumps and honking the horns. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  It was crazy to go back down there and you know, to come back down here last night, like [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=100.26s)]
*  it took me about 16 hours this time to get there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=104.54s)]
*  I had to make a couple of detours to pick up people and to get them here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=107.06s)]
*  So but I'm here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=110.10000000000001s)]
*  I'm proud. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=112.5s)]
*  I'm happy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=113.5s)]
*  We got your back for sure. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=114.54s)]
*  You mentioned to me too something I'd be remiss in not bringing up. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=116.5s)]
*  You're from Western North Carolina. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=119.5s)]
*  Your community has been directly affected by what's happened by Helene. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=121.78s)]
*  What's your response to the government's response? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=126.14s)]
*  So we just started getting FEMA up there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=128.7s)]
*  We've been devastated. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=131.3s)]
*  I had four days of not being able to contact my family. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=133.22s)]
*  No cell phone service, no nothing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=136.46s)]
*  So it's really hard to go back there and to see my community destroyed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=138.9s)]
*  My group boots on the ground. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=143.42s)]
*  We have been literally everybody getting funds trying to get, we've got trucks coming in. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=144.78s)]
*  We've got workers coming in. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=149.46s)]
*  We've got a hundred other workers. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=150.57999999999998s)]
*  We got retired Marine. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=152.34s)]
*  We have put out the word and we're doing it, you know, ourselves. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=153.42s)]
*  We can do it and we're working very hard to do it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, my daughter-in-law's father was out. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=160.62s)]
*  He came all the way from Florence to come up to help. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=166.82s)]
*  When he come up there to help them, like he was pulling out bodies yesterday out of mud [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=169.9s)]
*  and everything else. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  So it's not over yet, you guys. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=175.26000000000002s)]
*  The body counts are going to go up and it's very real. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=178.02s)]
*  My kid pulled up at a gas station to try to get gas. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=182.10000000000002s)]
*  They're limiting how much gas they can get and everything else. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  They've got generators and everything else to run. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  They got 39 degree weather coming up here really quick and they have no electricity [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=190.62s)]
*  for another four weeks, we're told. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=195.18s)]
*  So it's hard on them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=197.22000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, do what you can. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=198.54s)]
*  They need blankets, they need warm clothes and everything else. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=200.02s)]
*  But when my son went to the gas station, there were bodies in the back of a truck. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=202.3s)]
*  You know, he's 30 some years of age and he's never seen anything like that before. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=206.58s)]
*  So to hear him and to hug him, you know, four days after was, oh, it was incredible [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=210.74s)]
*  to have that connection with them again. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=217.54s)]
*  But you guys are hard hit and the smaller towns aren't getting the help [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=219.02s)]
*  that the bigger towns are getting. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=223.74s)]
*  I don't know what if it's political. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=226.18s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=228.38s)]
*  But I'm telling you, our small towns like in Newland, North Carolina, we are the farthest [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=229.54s)]
*  northwestern. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  We go 11 miles to the Tennessee border and we've got no help. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=235.42000000000002s)]
*  No help. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=240.74s)]
*  There you heard it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=241.74s)]
*  No help in a lot of places still digging out from what happened, the tragedy. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=243.3s)]
*  That'll certainly be a topic today. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=250.42000000000002s)]
*  And I know President Trump has been there. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=251.74s)]
*  He's been to Georgia, he's been to North Carolina, he's been leading the way and saying, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  we got to do more for these forgotten men and women in North Carolina who are not forgotten [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=256.14s)]
*  here this morning. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=259.94s)]
*  Thank you, Renee, all of you so much. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=260.94s)]
*  One more thing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=262.26s)]
*  Quick to be here is really hard when I know my family is suffering, but my family said, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=263.26s)]
*  keep fighting, mom, keep doing this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=268.26s)]
*  That's why I keep going to these rallies because we have to keep fighting and we have to let [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=269.9s)]
*  everybody know that we are here and we want to change. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=273.9s)]
*  We have to have a change. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMCtammiI8&t=276.97999999999996s)]
