*  Officials got there in time thanks to the efforts of a nearby family who spotted her and made the call. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPKfD1soV48&t=12.0s)]
*  She spotted me and she started to scream for help. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPKfD1soV48&t=18.0s)]
*  Help. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPKfD1soV48&t=22.0s)]
*  At first I couldn't locate her. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPKfD1soV48&t=23.0s)]
*  I thought she was in the river itself going downstream. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPKfD1soV48&t=26.0s)]
*  I was like, oh my gosh. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPKfD1soV48&t=30.0s)]
*  I finally was able to look across the river into the tree and I spotted her. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPKfD1soV48&t=32.0s)]
*  I began to call out to her and tell her that I see her. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPKfD1soV48&t=38.0s)]
*  I got you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPKfD1soV48&t=43.0s)]
*  We're going to get you some help. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPKfD1soV48&t=45.0s)]
*  It's going to be OK. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPKfD1soV48&t=47.0s)]
*  Just hang on. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPKfD1soV48&t=48.0s)]
*  You know, you didn't you didn't think about it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPKfD1soV48&t=49.0s)]
*  You just did what you needed to do to help them get into the water to save this young lady that's clinging to life in a tree. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPKfD1soV48&t=50.0s)]
