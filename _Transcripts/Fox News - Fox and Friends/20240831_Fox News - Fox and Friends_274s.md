# Republicans have 'stepped up their game' on this: Political reporter
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU)
*  Well guess who's back. Joe Biden, fresh off of two consecutive weeks of vacations, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=0.0s)]
*  is set to campaign with Kamala Harris in Pittsburgh on Labor Day. Meanwhile, Harris catching heat [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  after her recent interview, as we learned once you break it down, she only spoke to CNN for less than [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=11.36s)]
*  17 minutes. Here's what President Trump had to say about it. I think it was not exactly a great [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=17.04s)]
*  performance. It was a low energy performance. To take all of that time and get ready for that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=24.48s)]
*  kind of an interview, it was a softball interview. 40 days for 17 minutes. Our next guest also spoke [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=31.12s)]
*  to Trump at yesterday's rally, Washington Examiner National Political Reporter, Selena Zito joins us [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=38.16s)]
*  now. Selena, thank you for being here. It is staggering when you think one of two presidential [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  nominees takes a month to do one softball interview and even then looks terrible in doing so. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=51.52s)]
*  You contrast that with Donald Trump who does multiple interviews a day, including with you, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=57.6s)]
*  very recently, and is willing to take tough questions. She takes softballs. Do you think [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=61.92s)]
*  voters will start to see this contrast as we get closer to the election? Yeah, I absolutely [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=67.76s)]
*  think that. And you even hear Democrats sort of sighing on cable news networks about the lack [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=74.56s)]
*  of meat in that interview. I think that both a candidate and a campaign actually wants a vibrant [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=81.44s)]
*  exchange between a reporter and themselves because it gives the ability for the candidate [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=91.2s)]
*  to earn voters that might be skeptical for blocked down voters. That's the point. You're right. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  And that's what I talked to President Trump about yesterday. My story will be out in the Examiner [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  on Tuesday. I'm taking a look at Pennsylvania as a whole. I've been covering it for several decades. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=110.88s)]
*  Kind of know where you need to have a voter vote turnout to win the state. And we talked about that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=116.64s)]
*  We talked about Harris running as this sort of change and new candidate. And, you know, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=123.6s)]
*  he calls her out on the fact that she's been in power for four years almost and is responsible [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=132.88s)]
*  for a lot of the policies that have been put in place, including the ban in Pennsylvania on [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=140.0s)]
*  the export of liquid natural gas, which not only impacts people in the industry, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=147.92s)]
*  it also impacts farmers who rely on the royalties that are on their farms. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=153.6s)]
*  Selena, you know Pennsylvania as well as anybody. What is the state of the race when it comes to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  voter registration? I don't believe early voting hasn't started yet, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  but who has who's got the best organization on the ground between the two as far as getting [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=169.28s)]
*  people signed up to vote for their guy? Well, the Republicans have really stepped up their game. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=174.4s)]
*  And the numbers, I don't have them off the top of my head. However, they have changed dramatically [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=181.6s)]
*  since 2020. Republicans have now have the lead in voter registration in Cambria County, which is where [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=187.44s)]
*  President Trump was last night, where Johnstown is, but also in Bucks County and Beaver County. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=195.44s)]
*  These are very, very important counties. It's almost there in Luzerne County. Why are these [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=201.92s)]
*  counties important? Well, everyone focuses on Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, and rightly so, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=207.44s)]
*  they have the largest population. It is these smaller counties, in particular Erie, where I [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=212.56s)]
*  interviewed J.D. Vance on Wednesday, that you need to turn out the vote. That is where this vote [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=218.32s)]
*  will be decided. It will not be decided in Pittsburgh or Philadelphia. It will be decided [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=225.92s)]
*  in these smaller counties. That's why you see Trump in Luzerne. That's why in Cambria and in [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=231.84s)]
*  Butler. And that's why you saw J.D. Vance in Westmoreland County, and you saw him in Montgomery [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=239.12s)]
*  County, and you saw him in Erie. Absolutely. Oh, I think we just lost Selena. Her shot may have [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=244.64s)]
*  dropped. She's almost done. You got 99% of the way there, and we loved hearing every minute of it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  Selena, thank you so much for breaking it down. You're going to be busy for these 66 days [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=257.76s)]
*  right in the middle of Pennsylvania. Thank you. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujX_BKV4BU&t=261.76s)]
