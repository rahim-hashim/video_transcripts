# Brian Kilmeade: It's insane that Democrats are fighting this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q)
*  So Democrats are continuing their fight against President Trump's cost-cutting agenda in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=0.0s)]
*  courts with a judge blocking Doge from accessing certain Treasury Department payment records. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=4.96s)]
*  A separate ruling extending Trump's federal worker buyout deadline that at least 40,000 [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=12.48s)]
*  government employees have already accepted according to the White House. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=18.88s)]
*  Fox News, they've extended that until Monday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=22.6s)]
*  It was yesterday, now it's Monday. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=24.92s)]
*  Fox News contributor and former assistant U.S. attorney Andy McCarthy joins us now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=26.24s)]
*  Good morning to you, Andy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=30.56s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=31.56s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=32.56s)]
*  So this was a Clinton-appointed judge, so we expected something like this to happen. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=33.56s)]
*  But extending it a few more days, the White House's response was great. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  This is what Caroline Levitt said. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=41.339999999999996s)]
*  We are grateful to the judge for extending the deadline so more federal workers who refuse [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=43.56s)]
*  to show up to the office can take the administration up on this very generous, once-in-a-lifetime [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=47.56s)]
*  offer. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=53.12s)]
*  It is a great deal, isn't it, Andy? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=54.12s)]
*  You still get paid through September. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=55.84s)]
*  You could go get another job. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=57.6s)]
*  If you're one of the federal workers that moved to Florida, you can have two jobs, two [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=58.720000000000006s)]
*  paychecks through September. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  Ainsley, it's a great deal that's getting greater, right? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=64.44s)]
*  I think, wasn't it originally six months, and then the last few days they extended it [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  to eight months? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  Maybe if the judge puts it off a couple more days, it'll be a year. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  So what are the chances? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=76.92s)]
*  What are the chances of this judge on Monday? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=77.92s)]
*  So could the judge on Monday go, no, you can't do this? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=79.84s)]
*  Not an offer. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=81.88s)]
*  It's not funded. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=82.88s)]
*  We're not going to do it? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=83.88s)]
*  I mean, it really comes down to what that judge says on Monday, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=85.2s)]
*  Well, you know, look, I'd never say a judge can't do something, and there is a funding [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=90.36s)]
*  issue, although I think there's a provision in the agreement that provides for it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  But if the judge makes a ruling, then it's going to go to the First Circuit, and it'll [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=99.6s)]
*  probably end up with the Supreme Court. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=102.44s)]
*  So it'll take more time to sort it out, but that doesn't mean that it won't get upheld [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  in the end. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=109.0s)]
*  Isn't a boss allowed to fire his employees? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=110.0s)]
*  Well, this is a profound issue, actually, that goes back to the administrative state [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=112.28s)]
*  as it came to us beginning in the New Deal, right? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=120.0s)]
*  It's clear in the law that the president runs the executive branch. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=123.12s)]
*  The president's the only one in the executive branch with power. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=127.0s)]
*  And it's clear in the law that the president can fire at will top officials of the executive [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  branch. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=135.12s)]
*  It's never made any sense to me that the president doesn't have authority to fire everyone in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=136.12s)]
*  the executive branch. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=141.0s)]
*  But Congress started to enact these protections for government bureaucrats basically in the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=142.6s)]
*  1970s, and they've never really been challenged in court. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=149.0s)]
*  So we may be headed to the Supreme Court one way or the other. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=152.12s)]
*  So Musk says right now, while they delay what they can look at in Treasury, billions of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=154.88s)]
*  taxpayer dollars are still being paid to fraudulent entities and still being approved by Treasury. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=158.44s)]
*  This needs to stop. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=164.24s)]
*  That's why he's there. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=165.54000000000002s)]
*  Why Democrats are fighting that is insane. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think the suit is actually a good middle position because, as Tom Homan's pointed [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=169.84s)]
*  out any number of times, they could actually put cuffs on some of these state officials. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=185.28s)]
*  You could arrest people who are obstructing the administration of federal law enforcement [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  in an area, immigration and border security, that the courts say is exclusively the province [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=195.48s)]
*  of the federal government. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=200.72s)]
*  So I think it's a good middle step that they're going to court to sue them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  That's better than arresting mayors and other lawmakers who are interfering with this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=207.12s)]
*  I think they've got a very strong position in court. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the DOJ is suing Chicago, the state of Illinois and Cook County. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  They're arguing that local and state laws violate federal immigration laws. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=220.64s)]
*  Where will this go? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=224.84s)]
*  It's going to be a line drawing exercise. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=228.32s)]
*  Basically, you can't commandeer the states to force you to help enforce federal law. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=232.08s)]
*  But the federal authorities have the authority to enforce federal law. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=240.76s)]
*  So while they don't have to help them, they can interfere with them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=246.28s)]
*  So the question in front of the court is going to be where do you draw the line and how do [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  we judge the behavior of the states that the sanctuary cities are engaging in? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=254.48s)]
*  I just thought, didn't Trump already try this in 2017? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=258.88s)]
*  Didn't the court stop him from banning sanctuary cities? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=261.56s)]
*  And aren't we doing that now? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  Are we going back to the same playbook? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  I think that the legal terrain is a lot clearer than it was in 2017, Brian. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  Remember after Trump did what he did, there was a long litigation and ultimately the Supreme [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=276.2s)]
*  Court ruled. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=281.48s)]
*  I remember when it was 2018, 2019, that the president basically has a lot of authority [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=282.48s)]
*  to do the things that he's doing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=288.16s)]
*  So I think whatever the arrangement was in 2017, they're playing on more favorable turf [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=289.68s)]
*  for them now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=295.56s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=296.56s)]
*  It's the right thing to do. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=297.56s)]
*  Andy McCarthy, thanks so much. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=298.56s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=299.56s)]
*  Thank you, Andy. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7aWwrzL9Q&t=300.56s)]
