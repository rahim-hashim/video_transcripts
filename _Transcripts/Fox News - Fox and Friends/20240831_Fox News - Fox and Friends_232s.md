# Our schools will teach Americanism, Oklahoma school superintendent says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8)
*  The Oklahoma school superintendent is taking action [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=0.0s)]
*  after a high school teacher prevented a senior [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=3.16s)]
*  in one of the schools in Oklahoma [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=6.38s)]
*  from flying an American flag from his pickup truck [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=8.16s)]
*  last week. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=10.52s)]
*  Well, brand new guidelines will make schools [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=11.94s)]
*  across Oklahoma ensure flags can be flown [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=14.24s)]
*  and that students recite the Pledge of Allegiance [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=17.36s)]
*  at least once a week. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=19.26s)]
*  Oklahoma State school superintendent, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=21.8s)]
*  Ryan Walters joins us now to discuss. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Ryan, thanks for being here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=26.88s)]
*  We covered this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=27.72s)]
*  It was Edmond Public Schools. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=29.4s)]
*  They're north of Oklahoma City. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=30.64s)]
*  They say they don't allow any flags, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=32.56s)]
*  which then by extension meant the kids [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=34.56s)]
*  couldn't bring American flags, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=37.08s)]
*  so the kids are pushing back. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  Now, what's your stance on this idea [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  that no flags, only the American flag? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=42.24s)]
*  How should schools look at it? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=44.74s)]
*  And what's your stance in Oklahoma? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=46.16s)]
*  Hey, look, we're not gonna tolerate this anti-Americanism. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=49.16s)]
*  We've seen it being pushed by the Biden administration, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=51.96s)]
*  by the teachers unions, by the radical left. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=54.04s)]
*  We're not tolerating it in our schools. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=56.08s)]
*  We want patriots. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=57.68s)]
*  We want our students to fly in the American flag. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=58.92s)]
*  Here's the reality. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=61.64s)]
*  That is a flag that so many have died for, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  for us to have the right to fly it [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=65.68s)]
*  and be the greatest country in the history of the world. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=67.48s)]
*  We want our kids to know that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=69.82000000000001s)]
*  We want our kids to love that flag, love this country. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=71.34s)]
*  So we have acted swiftly to say [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=74.04s)]
*  this will never happen again. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=76.56s)]
*  Every single school in the state [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=77.94s)]
*  will protect the students right to fly that flag. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  We will fly that flag and we will promote patriotism [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=81.88s)]
*  in Oklahoma schools. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=84.92s)]
*  And in Oklahoma schools, if I'm correct, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=86.04s)]
*  the Pledge of Allegiance is required to be said [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=87.76s)]
*  once a week as well, right? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=89.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  Look, we need to be saying the pledge. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=92.52s)]
*  Our kids need to understand [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=93.64s)]
*  and develop that love for country. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=94.84s)]
*  It starts, we're also redeveloping [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=96.76s)]
*  our social studies standards [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=98.24s)]
*  to get more of an understanding of the American founding. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=99.36s)]
*  We need more patriotism. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=101.88s)]
*  We have seen our schools become leftist indoctrination mills, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=103.36s)]
*  pushing hatred for country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  That's not gonna happen in Oklahoma. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=108.74s)]
*  Our kids will understand what made this country [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=110.44s)]
*  the greatest country in the history of the world. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=112.68s)]
*  We will not allow the teachers unions [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=114.48s)]
*  to indoctrinate our kids. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=116.48s)]
*  We won't allow Kamala Harris and Joe Biden [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=118.58s)]
*  to continue to push that narrative into our schools. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=120.48s)]
*  Our schools will teach Americanism. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=122.84s)]
*  Next step, get rid of social studies. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=125.44s)]
*  The Progressive made that subject up altogether [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=126.92s)]
*  a hundred years ago, but that's a whole nother story. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=129.24s)]
*  I love this next one because the Oklahoma legislature [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=131.88s)]
*  going into this school season [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=134.52s)]
*  has required a course on Bible [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=135.76s)]
*  and incorporating the 10 Commandments [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=138.56s)]
*  into public school curriculum. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  It used to be that way in public schools. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=142.88s)]
*  We used to be able to talk about God, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=145.76s)]
*  talk about the Bible, talk about 10 Commandments. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  Now it's required in Oklahoma. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=149.5s)]
*  I think it's wonderful. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=151.6s)]
*  What's the response been from some of these school districts [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=152.89999999999998s)]
*  including in the tall buildings crowd in Oklahoma City? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=155.28s)]
*  Hey, look, I'm gonna tell you one thing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=160.42s)]
*  Parents are very excited. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  Look, we've got districts that are coming on board [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=162.48s)]
*  that understand exactly what we're trying to do here. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=164.45999999999998s)]
*  We're trying to teach real history. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=166.26s)]
*  The left has weaponized the government [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=168.0s)]
*  against Christianity, against the Bible saying, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  you can't talk about the Bible [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=173.0s)]
*  when you talk about the pilgrims. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=174.32s)]
*  When you talk about that our rights are endowed by us [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  by our creator, as Thomas Jefferson said, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  you're supposed to strip those things out of our history. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=179.72s)]
*  Well, look, the left doesn't have to agree. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=182.04s)]
*  They can be offended by it, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=183.72s)]
*  but they cannot rewrite our history. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=184.92s)]
*  Our kids are gonna understand the role the Bible played [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  in American history, its historical context. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=189.6s)]
*  So the Bible's gonna be back in classrooms here in Oklahoma. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=192.42s)]
*  We will absolutely talk about the impact [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=195.88s)]
*  the Bible had throughout our history. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=198.24s)]
*  It's a beautiful thing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=200.44s)]
*  You're right, we try to teach Western civilization. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=201.28s)]
*  We try to teach the pilgrims or the founding, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  and then we strip all of Christianity out of it [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=205.2s)]
*  and then wonder why it's so empty for kids when we teach it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=208.04s)]
*  Keep in touch with us about this, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  how this progresses over the school year [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=212.64s)]
*  and how you hold districts accountable that try to ignore it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  Ryan Walters, thank you so much for your time. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSL1QBvi2N8&t=217.48s)]
