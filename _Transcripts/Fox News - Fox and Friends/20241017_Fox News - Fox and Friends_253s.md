# Tulsi Gabbard: This is another example of Harris ‘lying to the American people’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0)
*  Vice President Kamala Harris pressed on her past support of taxpayer-funded sex changes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=0.0s)]
*  for inmates and illegal immigrants in her interview with Brett Baier. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=4.96s)]
*  Here's the sound bite. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=8.16s)]
*  Are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=10.48s)]
*  illegal aliens to transition to another gender? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=14.48s)]
*  I will follow the law. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=17.84s)]
*  And it's a law that Donald Trump actually followed. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=19.92s)]
*  Under Donald Trump's administration, these surgeries were available. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=22.48s)]
*  The Trump aides say that he never advocated for that prison policy and no gender transition [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=27.68s)]
*  surgeries happened during his presidency. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=32.64s)]
*  Well, you know what? You've got to take responsibility for what happened in your administration. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=34.08s)]
*  Former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard joins us with reaction. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=36.88s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=39.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=40.88s)]
*  What is your reaction when you hear that sound bite? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=41.44s)]
*  It's one of the many examples of how Kamala Harris is lying to the American people and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=44.32s)]
*  assuming that we're so stupid as just to believe her lies. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=49.2s)]
*  We've seen the sound bites and the clips of her when she was advocating and patting herself [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=53.68s)]
*  on the back for the law changes that she brought about that would do this very thing, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=58.64s)]
*  that would make sure that U.S. taxpayers are covering transgender surgeries for inmates. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=63.6s)]
*  She advocated for the same for illegal immigrants coming across our border. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=69.6s)]
*  She refuses to take responsibility and own up to her positions. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=74.0s)]
*  If her views have changed, fine, people can change. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=78.56s)]
*  But the American people deserve the respect enough to know exactly why she has changed. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=81.68s)]
*  In that interview with Brett, there are a number of examples where she is lying about [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=88.0s)]
*  her past positions in order to try to create this new version of herself that she thinks [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=92.0s)]
*  will be more palatable to voters. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  And it's offensive in my view. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  So this is such a neck and neck race. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=100.4s)]
*  Every single vote, every single viewer, their vote will matter. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=102.64000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=106.48s)]
*  And he pressed her on why, if he's so bad, why is he winning in the swing states? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=106.88s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  Why, if he's as bad as you say, that half of this country is now supporting this person who could be [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=114.16s)]
*  the 47th president of the United States, why is that happening? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=121.36s)]
*  Are they stupid? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=124.56s)]
*  Oh, God, I would never say that about the American people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=125.28s)]
*  And in fact, if you listen to Donald Trump, if you watch any of his rallies, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=128.48s)]
*  He's the one who tends to demean and belittle and diminish the American people. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=133.12s)]
*  He's the one who talks about an enemy within, an enemy within, talking about the American people, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=138.4s)]
*  suggesting he would turn the American military on the American people. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  They're so focused on that when they need to be focused on the economy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=151.68s)]
*  Everywhere we go, people say we can't afford groceries. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  They're worried about immigration, her immigration plan. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=158.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's an extension of what we've seen over the last three and a half years from the Biden [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=161.28s)]
*  Harris administration. People are continuing to be concerned about the high cost of living. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=166.32s)]
*  And they remember how over this past term in office, they've patted themselves on the back, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=171.6s)]
*  celebrating the success of Bidenomics and just saying, well, if the American people only knew [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=176.48s)]
*  how good we are and what a great job we did, then maybe we would be more popular. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=181.28s)]
*  But ignoring the reality of the struggles that the American people are continuing to face [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=185.44s)]
*  and why so many of them want to see change, they need to see a better economy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=189.92s)]
*  They need to see secure borders. And again, if you get past the propaganda media and Kamala [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=195.04s)]
*  Harris's lies, this is where I think President Trump really has an opportunity because he is [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=201.2s)]
*  the change candidate in this election. And what's interesting, this is probably [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=206.0s)]
*  the first time I think in my lifetime, at least, where we know what he stands for, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  because we had him for four years. We know what she stands for. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=214.48s)]
*  We had her for three and a half years. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  And that's the thing that I'm sharing with voters. I'm traveling across the country and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=218.4s)]
*  sharing with them why I'm endorsing President Trump, but encouraging them, say, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=222.72s)]
*  if you're undecided, if you have friends who are undecided, this is the first time we have [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  a clear record. You don't have to just listen to rhetoric. We know exactly what kind of president [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  both of them will be. And there's a huge contrast between the two. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=234.88000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming in and have fun at the Al Smith dinner tonight. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=238.24s)]
*  See you there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-jlvkcEOq0&t=241.60000000000002s)]
