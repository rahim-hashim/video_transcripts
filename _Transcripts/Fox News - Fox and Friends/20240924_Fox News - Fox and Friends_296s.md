# Peter Doocy: This would be an extraordinary development
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg)
*  All right, let's talk politics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=0.0s)]
*  Election day is six weeks from today. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=2.7s)]
*  Meanwhile, Vice President Harris is reportedly considering making a stop at our southern [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=4.4s)]
*  border during her trip to Arizona this Friday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=9.16s)]
*  That visit to the battleground state comes as the Democratic nominee tries walking back [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=13.32s)]
*  a number of her previous border stances. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=17.56s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Peter Deuces live at the White House. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=20.36s)]
*  Hey Peter. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=23.48s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=24.48s)]
*  And for most of the vice president's flip flops, the Harris campaign has been able to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=25.48s)]
*  tell us she changed her position. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=28.24s)]
*  Here it is now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=31.4s)]
*  But for some reason they cannot tell us whether or not she has changed her position on a 2019 [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=32.4s)]
*  stance she had making people brought to this country illegally as children, U.S. citizens. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=38.68s)]
*  Axios is reporting Harris pledged in 2019 to take four executive actions as president [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=44.12s)]
*  that would give two million dreamers a path to citizenship and shield more than six million [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=49.64s)]
*  undocumented immigrants from deportation. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=53.84s)]
*  Whether she'd take those same executive actions, her campaign declined to answer. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  The Harris team is so shy about this now, which would be a surprise to 2018 Kamala Harris, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=63.12s)]
*  Grand Marshall of the annual Kingdom Day Parade in Los Angeles, where she was standing beside [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=69.12s)]
*  actor Jussie Smollett chanting, Down with deportation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=74.36s)]
*  Up, up with education, down, down with deportation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=78.88s)]
*  The vice president's border experience has been tough to track. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=96.96s)]
*  She insists now that she was not the border czar, never was, but she has tried to keep [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=99.86s)]
*  some street cred about the border, like when we traveled with her there for her only trip [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=105.6s)]
*  as vice president a few months after President Biden put her in charge of the root causes [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  of migration. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  How are you going to decide that right now is the right time to make your first trip [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  to the border? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's not my first trip. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  I've been to the border many times. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  I'm the vice president. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=126.11999999999999s)]
*  I'm the person in charge of the response. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  Because as I've long said, I said back in March I was going to come to the border, so [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=128.12s)]
*  this is not a new plan. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=129.12s)]
*  She has not been able to make her first trip to the border. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=130.12s)]
*  She has not been able to make her first trip to the border. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=131.12s)]
*  She has not been able to make her first trip to the border. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=132.12s)]
*  She has not been able to make her first trip to the border. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=133.12s)]
*  She has not been back since then, but there is a possibility she could visit in Arizona [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=135.08s)]
*  on Friday according to a report in the New York Times. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=140.08s)]
*  If she does, that would be an acknowledgement by the Harris campaign that the border is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=142.72s)]
*  a huge liability for her ahead of the election six weeks from today. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=146.56s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Peter, the big thing that she keeps saying when asked is I'm the only one here [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  to prosecute transnational gangs. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  For those who have heard days a couple of times, in California, does that hold up today [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=159.92s)]
*  is the bigger question. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=164.33999999999997s)]
*  Does that show she's tough on the border, or does your exchange show that she's not [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  tough on the border? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=170.04s)]
*  Well, to your point, just look at the arc of her career. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=171.04s)]
*  She did prosecute transnational gangs, and then she was elected U.S. senator, and then [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  that video where she is chanting down with deportation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  So we are supposed to believe that her experience with all these hardcore human smugglers and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=185.32s)]
*  gang members and traffickers doing business across the border in California led her to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=192.16s)]
*  want fewer deportations in 2018. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=198.0s)]
*  And Peter, we have no idea for sure whether or not she's going to go on Friday, but we [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=202.0s)]
*  do know two things that she probably will say. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=205.88s)]
*  She's going to say, you know, we tried to fix it, but Donald Trump pulled the plug on [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  that bipartisan border bill. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=214.08s)]
*  She's also, I bet you a dollar, she says that border crossings are the lowest right now [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=216.12s)]
*  that they have been since 2020, because apparently, I was reading in the paper today, that is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=222.8s)]
*  true. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=227.96s)]
*  Yeah, well, they redefined the way that they count those crossings. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=228.96s)]
*  And it would, I'll take that dollar bet, by the way. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  It would make sense that she would say that, because that's what she's been saying, but [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  Things that she's been saying have her way behind Trump on the border. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=239.32000000000002s)]
*  And for her to go on Friday would be extraordinary, because she's been, I know they say she's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=244.0s)]
*  not the border czar, they don't like that term, but she's been in charge of the root [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=250.12s)]
*  causes of migration. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=253.08s)]
*  She still felt pressure to go about three months after President Biden gave her that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=255.26000000000002s)]
*  gig. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=259.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=260.92s)]
*  Hasn't been back since. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=261.92s)]
*  And if they thought that everything was great, like you just described the talking point, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=262.92s)]
*  killed the bipartisan deal, border crossings are down, they wouldn't go. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=267.16s)]
*  But they feel like they have to go if that's what happens on Friday. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=271.92s)]
*  Well, Peter, if you lose that bet, if I lose the bet, I'm taking it out of your allowance, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  okay? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=280.8s)]
*  That's Peter. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYZ5nhXENUg&t=281.8s)]
