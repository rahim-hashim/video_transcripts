# You CANNOT put hands on an ICE agent!: Homan
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY)
*  So today on Capitol Hill House lawmakers are set to examine threats to ICE operations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=0.0s)]
*  It comes as a Democratic congresswoman faces federal charges. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=6.04s)]
*  She's accused of assaulting a police officer during the storming of that New Jersey ICE [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=9.38s)]
*  facility earlier this month. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Border Zara Tom Holman joins us right now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=16.64s)]
*  So Tom, I said initially this was the right call. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=19.66s)]
*  I'm glad they conducted the investigation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=22.96s)]
*  They didn't overcharge, but they didn't undercharge as well. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=26.32s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=29.96s)]
*  Well, I said from day one, you cross that line, we're going to ask for prosecution. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=30.96s)]
*  You cannot support ICE. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=37.52s)]
*  You know, shame on you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=38.52s)]
*  You can push back against President Trump's immigration agenda. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=39.88s)]
*  Whatever, you can protest. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=43.16s)]
*  But you cannot cross that line. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=45.22s)]
*  You can't knowingly impede a law enforcement officer, ICE officer. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=46.74s)]
*  It's a crime. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  You can't knowingly conceal and harbor an illegal alien from ICE. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  You cannot commit criminal trespass to our facilities and endanger our employees. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=55.68s)]
*  And you certainly can't put hands on an ICE agent. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=60.68s)]
*  So she's going to have to pay the consequences for doing what she did. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  She broke the law and we're going to hold her accountable. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=69.64s)]
*  Tom, doesn't this send a message though to also the activists as well? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=72.52s)]
*  If she wanted to conduct oversight, she could have scheduled an appointment, arrived there [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=76.6s)]
*  and they would have gladly showed her the facility just like they did for our own Rachel Campos Duffy. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=82.16s)]
*  But she showed up with a mob and they assaulted the cops. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=87.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=91.16s)]
*  This is politics. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=92.16s)]
*  This is politics over public safety, politics over common sense. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=93.16s)]
*  I mean that facility is one of the finest facilities in this nation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=98.16s)]
*  And I should give a review to any Congressperson or any news station wants a criminal kept facility, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=102.44s)]
*  come out and look. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=108.88s)]
*  We have the highest detention standards in the industry. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=109.92s)]
*  That facility puts to shame any other facility in the state of New Jersey, any state or local [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=113.0s)]
*  facility that this facility puts in shame because of the detention standards are so high. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=117.44s)]
*  Anybody looks at any of our facilities will say, well, that was a waste of time because [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=124.44s)]
*  these detention facilities are actually really, really, really well built, really well maintained. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=128.0s)]
*  Detention standards are highest in the industry. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=133.12s)]
*  So come on and look at it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=134.76s)]
*  But you can't break into the facility. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=135.76s)]
*  You can't force your way into the facility. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=137.76s)]
*  And again, you can't put hands on a nice employee. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=139.56s)]
*  We're not going to tolerate it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=143.16s)]
*  Tom, let's talk about these self deportation flights. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=144.16s)]
*  I think the first one arrived yesterday. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=147.36s)]
*  You guys are going to pay folks a thousand bucks if they choose to self deport. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=150.68s)]
*  I was actually skeptical if this was going to work, but it looks like folks are already [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  taking these flights. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=161.0s)]
*  How did you convince them to self deport? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  They're going to face serious consequences. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  What we started doing, we're enforcing two laws that we haven't enforced in a long time. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=171.4s)]
*  Number one, failing to register. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=176.16s)]
*  If you don't fail to register after 90 days of being there, we're going to prosecute you [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=177.16s)]
*  criminally. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=181.64s)]
*  Then we're going to deport you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=182.64s)]
*  And if you hinder your arrest, if you don't open the door, if you don't answer our questions, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=183.64s)]
*  if you don't assist in travel documents, your home nation, after being already deported [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=189.44s)]
*  by the immigration judge, we're going to prosecute you for that, which is 8 U.S.C. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=193.2s)]
*  known 1253. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=197.28s)]
*  So we'll prosecute you. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=198.92s)]
*  We'll put you in prison. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=199.92s)]
*  When you get out, we'll deport you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=200.92s)]
*  We're not playing games. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=202.28s)]
*  There are going to be consequences. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=203.28s)]
*  Leave on your own. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=204.28s)]
*  If you leave on your own and work with us and get your affairs in order, it makes sense [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=205.72s)]
*  for them and their families. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=209.72s)]
*  And leave yourself an opportunity to come back to this country as a visitor or as a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=211.88s)]
*  student or if you have a U.S. citizen child, they can petition for you as a parent of a [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=216.04s)]
*  U.S. citizen. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  There are other avenues to come to this country the right way. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=223.16000000000003s)]
*  But if we have to formally deport you, we've got to go find you, and we've got to put you [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=225.72s)]
*  on a plane and formally deport you, there are consequences. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  There are bars from five years to 20 years you can't come back. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=234.36s)]
*  Some of the bars are forever. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  So leave on your own and give yourself some opportunity in the future to be part of the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  greatest country on earth. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=244.28s)]
*  Tom, I only got about 30 seconds. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=245.28s)]
*  I just got to get your reaction to the former VP candidate Tim Walz going after ICE, saying [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=247.36s)]
*  all of these words, accusing them essentially of being Nazis as well. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=254.36s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=259.72s)]
*  You used to run ICE. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=260.72s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=261.72s)]
*  Every man and woman in ICE straps a gun to their hip every day and wear a Kevlar vest [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=263.72s)]
*  to arrest the worst of the worst. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=267.12s)]
*  Look at the numbers. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=268.76s)]
*  ICE has almost arrested about 82,000 people in the United States, taking them out of the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=269.76s)]
*  streets, including his state. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=274.52000000000004s)]
*  They've taken very dangerous people off the streets of his state, made his state safer. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=276.32s)]
*  While he's sleeping at 3 o'clock this morning, there's ICE agents out there arresting public [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=282.0s)]
*  safety threats and national security threats in his state. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=286.36s)]
*  You ought to be thanking ICE and not vilifying them. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=288.92s)]
*  Great Tom Holman. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=292.2s)]
*  Thanks, brother. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=293.2s)]
*  A Democrat New Jersey Congresswoman now facing federal charges for allegedly misconduct or [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=294.2s)]
*  alleged misconduct toward law enforcement during the chaotic protest outside of that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=304.88s)]
*  ICE facility earlier this month. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=309.16s)]
*  I mean, you see it in the video right there. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=310.56s)]
*  Alexis McAdams is live in Newark. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  She was there initially when all of this broke out. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=314.24s)]
*  Alexis, what can you tell us? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=317.04s)]
*  Hey, good morning. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=318.92s)]
*  We were out there the day that the Newark mayor got arrested. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=321.16s)]
*  Things got pretty chaotic. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=324.72s)]
*  And it wasn't as chaotic, though, according to investigators, you guys, as a few minutes [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=325.72s)]
*  before that arrest happened. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=329.48s)]
*  They say Representative LaMonica McGyver was pushing and shoving ICE agents. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=331.04s)]
*  Now the Congresswoman is looking at federal charges here, serious felony charges that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=335.6s)]
*  were told. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=339.76000000000005s)]
*  After all, this happened. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=340.76000000000005s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=341.76000000000005s)]
*  Okay, so that's LaMonica McGyver right there. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=342.76000000000005s)]
*  You can see her on your screen for people watching at home saying, who is this lady? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=352.76s)]
*  She's right there. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  She's shoving and elbowing an ICE agent, according to prosecutors. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  The video released by DHS is just one of many pieces of evidence, I'm told, that interim [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=360.48s)]
*  U.S. attorney Aleta Haba, tells Fox, led to several felony charges of assaulting, impeding, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=365.6s)]
*  or interfering with law enforcement. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=371.56s)]
*  Haba posted this on X saying that the Congresswoman violated Title 18. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=373.52s)]
*  It all started earlier this month when three Democratic Congress members from New Jersey [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=378.36s)]
*  thought, hey, today looks like a good day to go to this ICE facility to do some oversight. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=382.4s)]
*  So it was Robert Menendez Jr., LaMonica McGyver, and Bonnie Watson Coleman. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=386.96s)]
*  They showed up to this facility in Newark, said they wanted a tour. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=391.28s)]
*  They waited, but DHS says they then just pushed their way past the gates of an ICE detention [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=394.91999999999996s)]
*  facility without permission, and it led to chaos. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  Newark Mayor Ross Baraka was actually arrested that day. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=402.47999999999996s)]
*  Now his case has been dropped. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=405.71999999999997s)]
*  They were only misdemeanor charges, so they wanted to go after the bigger case, we're [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=408.08s)]
*  told. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=411.56s)]
*  Investigators tell me McGyver blocked police from putting handcuffs on Newark Mayor Ross [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=412.56s)]
*  Baraka, so agents had to wait to arrest him for trespass outside. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=416.44s)]
*  So that's why it happened a short time later. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=420.64s)]
*  Despite all this video evidence, McGyver said she didn't do anything wrong. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=422.64s)]
*  She says the charges are purely political, saying in part, it's meant to criminalize [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=426.52s)]
*  and deter oversight. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  This is what she said last week. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=432.24s)]
*  Listen. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=433.52s)]
*  We were simply there to do our job, therefore oversight visit. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=434.52s)]
*  And what you're watching in a video, when we don't have all of the body cam, and we [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=439.68s)]
*  hope that all of the body cam is released. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=443.68s)]
*  It was very difficult to watch that happen, but absolutely, I did not body slam anyone. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=445.56s)]
*  And I actually talked to the Congress members out there that day, and she mentioned that [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  Monica McGyver rather mentioned that she felt like she was the one who was under attack [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=457.24s)]
*  by federal agents. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=461.32000000000005s)]
*  But that's not what the body camera video shows, according to DHS. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=462.32000000000005s)]
*  Representative Hakeem Jefferies and other leaders of the Democratic Party aren't too [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=465.16s)]
*  for being told that McGyver's got to turn herself in at some point today. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=469.8s)]
*  So we got an eye in the courthouse. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=473.88s)]
*  We've got crews around Newark to see when and if she shows up. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=475.32s)]
*  So I'll keep you posted. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=478.72s)]
*  So Alexis, didn't you also report that one of her bigger offenses was blocking the mayor [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=479.72s)]
*  from being cuffed? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=485.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=486.48s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=487.48s)]
*  And you mentioned earlier, I was listening to you around six o'clock this morning, Brian, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=488.48s)]
*  and that's when they said they had to wait until he came back outside the gate. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=492.12s)]
*  So according to Congress members that were there, they were saying, we didn't do anything [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=495.32s)]
*  wrong. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=498.84s)]
*  You know, why is he being arrested on public property? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=499.84s)]
*  But they're saying that's impeding. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=501.44s)]
*  When they were inside the ICE facility, they wanted to cuff the mayor because he wasn't [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=503.12s)]
*  supposed to be there. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=505.88s)]
*  And then they said, hey, no, no, don't do it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=506.88s)]
*  So the mayor got exonerated. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=509.04s)]
*  He's on his own. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=510.44s)]
*  And it's a way cooperating. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=511.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=513.36s)]
*  You cooperated with the U.S. attorney. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=514.36s)]
*  And so they dropped the charges. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=515.92s)]
*  Thanks, Alexis. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  Actually, all of these people are looking for a moment, though. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=519.04s)]
*  You know, they really are. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=522.32s)]
*  And a peaceful protest is fine. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=524.9200000000001s)]
*  But what we saw there, we did see her with her arm, her elbow, and then her arm and pushing [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=526.9000000000001s)]
*  through the cops, doing that to them. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=532.36s)]
*  The same thing would happen to any one of us. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=534.62s)]
*  It's not political. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=536.4200000000001s)]
*  If you're pushing a cop, then you're going to get arrested or you're going to have charges. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=537.4200000000001s)]
*  There's going to be some sort of a punishment. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=541.82s)]
*  These guys put on their vests and their badges, like Tom Homan said earlier, they risk their [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=543.6600000000001s)]
*  lives to keep our community safe. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=548.12s)]
*  And you can't treat them that way. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=549.96s)]
*  Here's Tom Homan. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=551.12s)]
*  From day one, you cross that line, we're going to ask for prosecution. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=552.92s)]
*  You cannot support ICE. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=557.38s)]
*  You know, shame on you. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=558.38s)]
*  You can push back against President Trump's immigration agenda. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=559.72s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=563.16s)]
*  You can protest. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=564.16s)]
*  But you cannot cross that line. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=565.16s)]
*  You can't knowingly impede a law enforcement officer or ICE officer. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=566.6s)]
*  It's a crime. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=571.0s)]
*  You can't knowingly conceal and harbor an illegal alien from ICE. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=572.0s)]
*  You cannot commit criminal trespass to our facilities and endanger our employees. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=575.54s)]
*  And you certainly can't put hands on an ICE agent. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=580.56s)]
*  So she's going to have to pay the consequences for doing what she did. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=584.9s)]
*  She broke the law and we're going to hold her accountable. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=589.5s)]
*  Existing politics over public safety, politics over common sense. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=591.4799999999999s)]
*  I mean, that facility is one of the finest facilities in this nation. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=594.76s)]
*  And that's what they found out when they took a tour of it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=598.64s)]
*  And this has all become too performative. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=601.1199999999999s)]
*  They're trying to fake the civil rights movement. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=603.7199999999999s)]
*  First of all, they never were violent during the civil rights movement. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=606.0s)]
*  They never pushed cops and they never impeded arrest. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=608.46s)]
*  I think there's consequences now. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=611.98s)]
*  Now they're going to think twice before they do this again. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2QK9apFziY&t=614.5400000000001s)]
