# ICE releases shocking report on murderers, criminals allowed into US
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA)
*  All right, Vice President Harris promising Nevada voters that she will solve the problems at the southern border [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=0.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=5.92s)]
*  It comes as the dhs works to downplay ice data showing tens of thousands of illegal migrants with serious convictions [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=7.12s)]
*  Are roaming free in our country [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=15.6s)]
*  Jackie heinrich is roaming free at the white house and she joins us live. Hey jackie [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=17.6s)]
*  Good morning to you guys vice president harris claims that she will go even farther than president biden to secure the board [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=22.88s)]
*  And will make it tougher to reopen it under the executive orders that he put in place last june [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=30.24s)]
*  That restricts asylum when the average numbers of crossings [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=36.56s)]
*  Eclipse a threshold of 2,500 per day over the course of a week [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=40.24s)]
*  It only reopens when that number dips below 1,500 per day [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=44.4s)]
*  We have not yet reached that number and harris is now saying that she would drop it down even lower [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=47.6s)]
*  So create an even higher threshold to reopen the southern border [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=52.96s)]
*  Um harris is saying though that this is going to be part of her plan that she announced over the weekend listen [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=57.28s)]
*  those who cross [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  Our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from reentering for five years. We will pursue [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=65.92s)]
*  more severe criminal charges [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=74.56s)]
*  against repeat [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=77.04s)]
*  Violators and if someone does not make an asylum request [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=78.64s)]
*  at a legal point of entry [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=83.36s)]
*  And instead crosses our border unlawfully [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=86.0s)]
*  They will be barred [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=89.6s)]
*  from receiving asylum [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=91.2s)]
*  The bulk of harris's speech though is about trump [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=93.44s)]
*  She painted him as the agent of chaos said he didn't solve the shortage of border agents or immigration judges as president [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=95.68s)]
*  And killed the bipartisan border bill that she has now co-opted as her own platform [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=101.68s)]
*  Trump has fired back especially after new ice data revealed tens of thousands of illegal migrants with sex offenses [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=105.84s)]
*  And homicide convictions are running around the country undetained [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  Among them more than 13 000 convicted of homicide [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  15 000 convicted of sexual assault in all the data shows [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=121.5s)]
*  425 [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  431 convicted criminals not in detention right now with an additional 222 000 with pending criminal charges [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=126.56s)]
*  DHS says in a statement the data in the letter is being misinterpreted the data goes back decades [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=133.52s)]
*  It includes individuals who entered the country over the past 40 years or more the vast majority of whose custody determination was made long before this [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=138.0s)]
*  administration [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=145.34s)]
*  It includes many who are under the jurisdiction or currently incarcerated by federal state or local law enforcement partners [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=146.32s)]
*  However, they didn't provide any data to us to break down that answer. Here's what trump says [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=153.28s)]
*  Kamala you're fired [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=159.98000000000002s)]
*  You're fired get out of here go back to san francisco [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  Francisco kamala which you destroyed starting on day one [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=166.26s)]
*  I will seal the border and stop the invasion of migrants into our country very dangerous migrants [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=169.62s)]
*  We will carry out the largest deportation operation of criminals in american history [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=176.18s)]
*  The vice president was supposed to be doing additional stops in nevada today [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=182.66s)]
*  But she's returning from her west coast swing early to get a briefing at fema headquarters on hurricane. Halene impacts guys [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=187.06s)]
*  And jackie jackie, she was out west, uh to give that speech on [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=194.74s)]
*  Friday, but really she was out there to raise money. I read this morning. She raised [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=199.78s)]
*  55 million bucks to fundraisers [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=205.44s)]
*  Yeah, she had a number of fundraisers this weekend and she was set to have a couple more events today [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=208.66s)]
*  But evidently not a good look to be campaigning while people are suffering in north carolina and down the east coast [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=213.06s)]
*  So she is hightailing it back here [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  We are told early this morning first thing this morning, so we are waiting her arrival guys. All right [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=221.78s)]
*  We'll see how high tails go [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=226.1s)]
*  Thanks jackie. Uh, so we know this the president the former president will be in north carolina today over the weekend [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=228.34s)]
*  He's already been affected. He wanted to have a big outdoor rally in wisconsin was stunningly two weeks ago [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  I talked to someone three weeks ago now. I talked to someone with the trump campaign [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=238.5s)]
*  They were almost ready to give up on wisconsin and now wisconsin's within a point or two [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=242.26s)]
*  Michigan is a dead heater within a point or two [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=246.39999999999998s)]
*  So it's come all the way back. He wanted to have a big outdoor rally in wisconsin instead secret service tells him [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=248.58s)]
*  Can't do it. It's unbelievable 2500 go indoors [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=253.94000000000003s)]
*  I mean that is that is a huge adjustment because you get all those names possible donations [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=256.74s)]
*  And those people tell other people the whole town gets involved even though next week he's going to go to butler keep in mind [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=261.86s)]
*  She is down [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=267.54s)]
*  Pretty in a major way 14 points in arizona when it comes to immigration [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=268.90000000000003s)]
*  She wants to get one or two points back [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=272.66s)]
*  But as I mentioned in the first hour how unbelievable the audacity that she shows sitting in front of that wall [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  That obama built that was extended by trump and was stopped by people like her as senator [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=281.14s)]
*  And she called it a medieval vanity project that he wanted to finish now [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=287.7s)]
*  She's embracing it if she showed that type of passion three years ago people would say well [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=292.65999999999997s)]
*  She tried and she tried and she maybe her policies didn't work [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=297.38s)]
*  But you know what she was down there grinding away instead [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  She did a couple of zoom calls in one visit and adds visa to bolster the local economies of central american nations [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=303.38s)]
*  then she gives a speech which [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=310.18s)]
*  There has to be some fact checks going forward. She talks about amnesty as if there's any appetite [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=313.62s)]
*  the the country by and large is for mass deportations now because [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=319.3s)]
*  60 of what's happening to the boy, but yet she still talks about it. Then she says that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=323.3s)]
*  Under her policy now that all the people that have entered in the country and then go through the legal process [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=329.62s)]
*  Would have to go back to the back of the line to be deported [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=335.14000000000004s)]
*  So it's kamala here's for mass deportations. Does that include the 10 million plus [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  Million of illegals that have crossed under her reign as well. There's no specific changes. There's no pushback [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=343.54s)]
*  Also, the follow-up is okay. Are you now supporting ice now? Do you not want them to be defunded? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=349.3s)]
*  Are you going to give them more money? Remember there were no follow-ups [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, maybe these are things that are going to come up tomorrow night in the vice presidential debate [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=357.7s)]
*  It will be interesting to hear tim waltz defend that she keeps saying a pathway to citizenship [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=362.58s)]
*  But how scary is that that there 15 almost 16 000 convicted? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=367.14s)]
*  Of sexual assault migrants just running around our country. There are 13 000 convicted of homicide [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=372.5s)]
*  Running around our country and that is you don't verify and you don't get to downplay it and say, okay [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=379.78000000000003s)]
*  This is at large the american people are seeing the little girls that were raped [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=384.34s)]
*  We put all the families on who were murdered for when they were jogging [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=387.94s)]
*  So it's one thing to downplay things where you don't have solid examples all over the country [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=392.17999999999995s)]
*  Like communities being taken over by trinity agua like it's happening all over the country [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=397.46s)]
*  What were the new numbers that we reported in new york city about all the migrants that are committing more crimes 75% of the crimes [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=403.46s)]
*  Okay, you can tell us all day that this is in large [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=411.62s)]
*  But I see a lot of young men that we've been putting behind bars that have committed these crimes [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=414.26000000000005s)]
*  And a lot of people who are not they don't really know [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=419.46000000000004s)]
*  What she has or hasn't done and so they watch her at a speech and if she can give a speech [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=423.14000000000004s)]
*  They think that you know that she's doing a good job. Meanwhile, they don't know the facts those numbers are staggering [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=427.62s)]
*  Yes, this is scary to know that these these illegals are running around that are convicted of crimes [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=432.74s)]
*  And then she stands in front of the border wall and uses it in her in her ads now and goes down there [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=438.1s)]
*  So people are saying oh she did go down to the border [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=443.54s)]
*  well when uh [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=446.34s)]
*  Kamal harris and joe biden were elected to be president vice president one of the things they promised was to fix [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=447.7s)]
*  The supply chain and that leads us to our next story [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr7QdHjBEEA&t=452.98s)]
