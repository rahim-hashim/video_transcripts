# Peter Doocy: This is very unusual
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss)
*  Another thing that President Trump just did is he brought back the Super Bowl pregame [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=0.0s)]
*  interview tradition yesterday as he became the first sitting president in history to [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=3.58s)]
*  attend the big game. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=7.78s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey joins us with the latest. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=9.46s)]
*  Good morning Peter. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=12.18s)]
*  Good morning and here at the White House the Doge effort continues tens of millions of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=13.68s)]
*  dollars at a time. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=18.26s)]
*  The latest from Elon Musk posted at 5.03 a.m. says the Doge team just discovered that FEMA [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=19.88s)]
*  sent $59 million last week to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=27.38s)]
*  Sending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the president's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=33.78s)]
*  executive order. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=38.14s)]
*  That money is meant for American disaster relief and instead is being spent on high-end [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=39.44s)]
*  hotels for illegals. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=43.8s)]
*  A clawback demand will be made today to recoup those funds as President Trump gives a vote [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=45.78s)]
*  of confidence to the world's richest man. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=52.22s)]
*  Bob Dylan you say you trust him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=55.98s)]
*  Trust Elon? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=58.58s)]
*  Oh he's not gaining anything. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=59.58s)]
*  In fact I wonder how he can devote the time to it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=60.96s)]
*  He's so into it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  But I told him do that then I'm going to tell him very soon like maybe in 24 hours to go [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=64.48s)]
*  check the Department of Education. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=70.58s)]
*  He's going to find the same thing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=72.62s)]
*  Then I'm going to go to the military. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=74.14s)]
*  Let's check the military. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=76.02s)]
*  We're going to find billions hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=77.02s)]
*  And a little bit more on the CBS YouGov polls you guys were just talking about. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=82.72s)]
*  The honeymoon is not over yet for the president with this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=87.28s)]
*  Sixty nine percent are saying that he is tough. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=90.32s)]
*  Sixty three percent say he is energetic. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=92.92s)]
*  Fifty eight percent say he is effective. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=95.08s)]
*  He did not stay the whole time at the Super Bowl but still got back here at about 1230 [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=97.72s)]
*  last night. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  And Peter do we know why the president left early? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  I think he left at eight o'clock local time. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=108.08s)]
*  Really a security thing right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=110.88s)]
*  He did leave early but it seemed like that was pretty much in line with the schedule [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  that we had for him. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=117.28s)]
*  And in case he didn't have it on on the plane week and he's watching right now Mr. President [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=119.36s)]
*  you didn't miss anything in the second half. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=123.84s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=125.8s)]
*  And Peter speaking of the plane something different yesterday and you've seen this [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  graphic this morning where the president has signed the proclam shows essentially the Gulf [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=132.12s)]
*  of America has used to be the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=137.8s)]
*  What's interesting about that is that the president actually had the traveling press [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=141.6s)]
*  come into his office on Air Force One. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=147.56s)]
*  That's something new. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=150.8s)]
*  It is definitely something that we have not seen since the last time he was president. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=152.44s)]
*  We have seen photos of Joe Biden and Jill Biden sitting in the chair there in the office [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=156.8s)]
*  in the cabin on Air Force One. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=163.24s)]
*  But it is very very unusual to have the press into that part of the president's plane. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=165.24s)]
*  He did it last night and he continues to figure out different ways just to keep getting the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=171.2s)]
*  word out and to weigh in on pretty much every single topic. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=178.4s)]
*  Another PR win for the president. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  He even found a chance to talk about Taylor Swift. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  Who knew? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=191.6s)]
*  Yeah it turns out President Trump if anybody was curious still has a very long memory. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=192.64s)]
*  He remembers that she endorsed Kamala Harris and he was really rubbing it in last night [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  when her boyfriend had a terrible game. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=203.0s)]
*  He did indeed. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=205.68s)]
*  Alright Peter thank you so much. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq6vy1Vnkss&t=206.68s)]
