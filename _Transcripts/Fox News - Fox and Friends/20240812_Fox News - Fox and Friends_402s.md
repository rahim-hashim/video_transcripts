# Ainsley Earhardt: Who's running the show?
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44)
*  I am just stunned that we have moved on from the story of everyone knowing that the president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=0.0s)]
*  has not been there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=5.8s)]
*  For years now, Nancy Pelosi taking over the White House negotiation when it came to the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=7.42s)]
*  infrastructure bill, and we're just letting it go, replacing it with common layers, and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=12.88s)]
*  she knew everything. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=17.96s)]
*  People have been talking for at least a year that he's not really running the show. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=19.76s)]
*  A couple years. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=23.76s)]
*  Yeah, a couple years. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=24.76s)]
*  He's not running the show. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=25.76s)]
*  So when you see him sitting on the beach, you're like, you might do the same thing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=26.76s)]
*  They kick you out and you don't have anything else to do. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=29.84s)]
*  Except you have a country, you have Ukraine who penetrated into Russia. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=32.28s)]
*  Israel about to be rocketed. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=36.72s)]
*  But my point is, he's not running the show. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=37.72s)]
*  People behind the scenes are making the decision. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=41.4s)]
*  No, I think he's making the decision. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=43.72s)]
*  Is it virtual, one of those virtual things? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=44.72s)]
*  Does he even have his eye for it? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=46.36s)]
*  I just find it interesting that David Plouffe went on Twitter this weekend and was going [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=49.08s)]
*  out to Donald Trump, saying, is this a man that you want having a nuclear code? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=54.36s)]
*  I mean, you've got a president that's not even there to have the codes right now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=58.04s)]
*  Can you really make that argument right now? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=60.96s)]
*  Just vacation on the beach. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=63.08s)]
*  David Plouffe was Obama's campaign manager, and now he's helping Kamala. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=64.08s)]
*  The nuclear codes were in one of those spaces, covered with sand. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=68.2s)]
*  He'll put them in his garage next to the car bed. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=73.8s)]
*  So the big question is, and Meredith brought this up, where Biden is talking about he will [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=78.64s)]
*  go out on the campaign to support Kamala Harris as however he can. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=83.68s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=89.4s)]
*  Does she want him? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  You got to say no, given that his numbers are under water. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=92.22000000000001s)]
*  And that's going to happen apparently. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=96.56s)]
*  They've been coordinating that behind the scenes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=97.92s)]
*  The only thing that surprised me is they picked Waltz when Barack Obama was so firmly in Josh [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=99.76s)]
*  Shapiro's court. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=103.44000000000001s)]
*  So it makes you bring the whole anti-Semitism thing that's marveled into the party. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=104.92000000000002s)]
*  There's two things that Trump has really got going in his direction. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=109.76s)]
*  He's still got a higher Hispanic vote count than anyone, even over George W. Bush, and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=112.52s)]
*  the American Jewish vote. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=118.6s)]
*  If you're pro-Israel, if you're a Jewish-American, you cannot be pleased about what happened [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=120.28s)]
*  to the party you've always voted for. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=125.0s)]
*  And that's why he's up higher than he's ever been in New York with the Jewish vote. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=127.0s)]
*  He has more Hispanics now than he did in the last election. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=131.2s)]
*  Kamala Harris was told, like a week ago before she announced Waltz, she was told by her vetters [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=135.4s)]
*  and the polling people, you can win with any of these three people, Shapiro, Waltz, or [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=140.66s)]
*  Mark Kelly. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=145.5s)]
*  And so then she had the final apprentice-style interview. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=146.7s)]
*  And apparently Mark Kelly just, he was okay. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=151.73999999999998s)]
*  He was always going to be the third choice. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=154.45999999999998s)]
*  Josh Shapiro seemed too ambitious. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=155.94s)]
*  First thing he did was Josh Shapiro said, okay, so what are my duties? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  What will my authority be? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=162.06s)]
*  And then Waltz said, I will, I don't have to do anything. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=163.42s)]
*  I don't have to be the last one in the room. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=166.5s)]
*  I will do anything I want. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=168.5s)]
*  I think he won't upstage her and maybe Shapiro would have. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=170.46s)]
*  And I think she looked at his record and she said, oh, he votes like I do and everything. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=173.82000000000002s)]
*  He's very progressive. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=177.54000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=178.54000000000002s)]
*  What Peggy Doonan said I think is so insightful. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=179.54000000000002s)]
*  She said by picking Waltz, Kamala Harris is saying, I will win with the left alone. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=183.22s)]
*  And if an anti-Trump-er and a moderate wants to join you, you can do it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=187.9s)]
*  He goes, but I'm going to mobilize those 18 to 24s who sat on the sidelines who weren't, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=190.9s)]
*  I'll win with the left. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=196.10000000000002s)]
*  I will not need the middle. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=198.1s)]
*  And I don't care about Trump-ers, anti-Trump-ers. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  It's definitely a double down. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=202.22s)]
*  So we were telling you about the current president, Joe Biden. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=203.57999999999998s)]
*  He's had a lot of time to reflect. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=206.45999999999998s)]
*  He's been on the beach. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=207.85999999999999s)]
*  And one of the things he reflected on. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  I saw those pictures. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=210.98s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=212.45999999999998s)]
*  Kind of sad. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=213.45999999999998s)]
*  He's been reflecting on the economy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=214.45999999999998s)]
*  He says everything is going so well. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=216.94s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  How do you want history to remember President Biden? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=220.26s)]
*  The improved democracy can work. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=226.66s)]
*  It got us out of a pandemic. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=228.82s)]
*  It produced the single greatest economic recovery in American history. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=232.38s)]
*  We're the most powerful economy in the world. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=236.22s)]
*  We have more to do. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=239.22s)]
*  And it demonstrated that we can pull the nation together. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=241.78s)]
*  Look, I've always believed and I still do. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=244.94s)]
*  The American people are good and decent. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=247.38s)]
*  They're honorable people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=249.26s)]
*  When I announced my candidacy to run way back for president, I said, we got to do three [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=251.38s)]
*  things. We story of the soul of America. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=256.18s)]
*  Build the economy from the middle out in the bottom up, not the top down and bring the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=259.46s)]
*  country together. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=263.62s)]
*  I mean, should we complete the rest of the show whispering like that? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=265.02s)]
*  Brian said there must be a sleeping baby in the next room. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=268.34s)]
*  Well, you know, he can say the interview, but there's children. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=272.14s)]
*  And we're laughing at what he said about the economy. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=274.7s)]
*  He thinks he's responsible for it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=276.97999999999996s)]
*  I mean, first of all, we're far worse than we are than we were under Donald Trump. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=278.58s)]
*  Look at these numbers. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=283.3s)]
*  Well, he can say what he wants to say. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=284.02s)]
*  He's a politician. Nobody's under oath there. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=285.38s)]
*  Well, we'll check the numbers. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=287.7s)]
*  But when you look at and the left side is the left side during Kamala Harris and Joe [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=288.82s)]
*  Biden, wage growth has gone down. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=294.7s)]
*  Inflation is up about 20 percent. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=297.06s)]
*  And we're taking on much more credit card debt because we can't pay for stuff, you know, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=298.78s)]
*  with actual money. And we've got to pay for it over a period of time at a very high [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=303.94s)]
*  interest rate. Right. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=307.86s)]
*  And the whole thing about him saving the economy when it was already coming out and he [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=308.86s)]
*  used the rescue plan that many people, including Larry Summers, says would lead to inflation, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=312.06s)]
*  prolonged inflation, which he did. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=317.38s)]
*  He had three huge spending programs that he considers a big plus for the green side of [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=319.14s)]
*  his party. I'm sure they think that the other big story that's under reported is I don't [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=324.38s)]
*  know many Irish people that enjoy sitting directly in the sun because as a people we [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=328.58s)]
*  blister. There's a reason why the sun doesn't really shine in Ireland because the skin [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=333.34000000000003s)]
*  can't handle it. I mean, my dad used to sit on the beach with a blanket over him. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=337.38s)]
*  I mean, I was going to try to provide some analysis on the talking point, but I don't [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=341.86s)]
*  know how I pivot. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=345.9s)]
*  It's very the same. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=347.74s)]
*  After you Irish people watching this know you want it unless it's black Irish, which [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=348.62s)]
*  is another story about the Spanish. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=353.98s)]
*  Oh, that is a thing. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=355.34s)]
*  Yeah. Does this just go back to your ankles and that hair situation? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=356.38s)]
*  No, my shins. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=360.1s)]
*  I turned it. It's facing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=362.14s)]
*  Right. I'm amputated so I can go to the beach. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=363.46s)]
*  Stop talking about my heater. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=365.18s)]
*  They're going to take it away from me. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=366.42s)]
*  Who's they? I don't know. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=367.9s)]
*  Someone's going to. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=369.26s)]
*  The powers that be. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=369.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=370.78s)]
*  You guys done with the distractions? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=371.82s)]
*  It's like a heated seat in your car. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=373.09999999999997s)]
*  You know, it just adds a little extra comfort. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=374.98s)]
*  Which I don't usually put on in August. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=377.26s)]
*  I do. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=378.94s)]
*  We're all different. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=380.58s)]
*  Right. But I'm not different. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=381.58s)]
*  I'm more traditional. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=383.42s)]
*  I sweat in August with a heater. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=385.46s)]
*  It's not facing you, Brian. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=387.98s)]
*  It's facing me. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X3xBp9Mu44&t=389.94s)]
