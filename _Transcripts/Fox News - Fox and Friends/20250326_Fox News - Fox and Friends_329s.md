# AOC confronted on Tesla attacks, gives 'ridiculous' answer
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10)
*  All right, the FBI investigating the bombs found in a Tesla showroom in Austin as protesters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=0.0s)]
*  prepare for their Tesla takedown day of action this week. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=8.68s)]
*  Here's AOC on who she's blaming for the violence against Teslas. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Do you think Democrats are to blame for why people are so triggered by this? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=17.68s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=22.32s)]
*  Because when you're at rallies saying, not you particularly, but your colleagues saying [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=23.32s)]
*  F Elon Musk and using other words, profane words to describe him, does that rile people [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=26.24s)]
*  up, your supporters, to take action on their own? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  You know, I think about Republicans calling me a communist and Republicans saying that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  I hate this country. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=40.72s)]
*  And I certainly have felt the impact of that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=42.28s)]
*  OK, Fox News contributor and author of Calif Failure, Reversing the Ruin of America's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=49.32s)]
*  Steve Hilton joins us now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=55.34s)]
*  We'll get to that book in just a moment. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=56.980000000000004s)]
*  But Steve, what did you think of her remarks there? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=58.58s)]
*  I mean, wasn't that an opportunity to denounce this violence? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=61.14s)]
*  AOC is just such a ridiculous caricature of herself now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=64.78s)]
*  What is she talking about? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=70.02s)]
*  It is very evident that the left are pushing this violence. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=71.44s)]
*  There's no other word to describe it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=76.06s)]
*  It's political violence. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=77.62s)]
*  It is terrorism. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=79.04s)]
*  I remember very clearly growing up in the UK. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=80.04s)]
*  We had regularly, you'd have bombing little bombs in litter bins on the street, railway [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=83.22s)]
*  stations in pubs. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=89.9s)]
*  It was IRA, the Irish Republican Army. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=91.46s)]
*  It was a terror campaign. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=94.58s)]
*  It was designed to influence policy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=96.08s)]
*  That's what this is. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=98.34s)]
*  It is designed to influence policy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=99.34s)]
*  And it's even worse than that because you look at Elon Musk, this is one of the greatest [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=102.06s)]
*  entrepreneurs of all time, probably the greatest entrepreneur. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=106.06s)]
*  He's trying to help his country. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=109.74s)]
*  What does this say to any business leader or anyone who wants to get involved with the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=111.66s)]
*  Trump administration? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=117.06s)]
*  They're trying to intimidate people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=118.38s)]
*  That's why we've got a clamp down on this incredibly hard. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=120.3s)]
*  It is terrorism, just as President Trump says. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=123.46s)]
*  Also, what does it say about the political left that they think that this is a messaging [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=125.74s)]
*  strategy that is going to work? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=130.18s)]
*  I mean, you tell me what you're seeing as far as the Teslas and are they getting rid [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=131.82s)]
*  of them? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=135.2s)]
*  I mean, we've even seen some of the Teslas out on the road who have stickers on them [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=136.2s)]
*  I bought this before Elon Musk went crazy or whatever it is. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=139.06s)]
*  But is this a sign that the left really isn't going to learn from the last election? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=143.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  They're not learning at all. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=148.85999999999999s)]
*  I mean, any normal person can see that the reason that they were defeated is they went [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=150.22s)]
*  too far left. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=155.22s)]
*  And look where the energy is right now in the party. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=156.64s)]
*  It's the left, it's AOC, it's Bernie. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=159.82s)]
*  And so it seems to me like they just haven't realized how out of step they are with the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=162.4s)]
*  American people. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=167.38s)]
*  All right, you've got this awesome book with you. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=168.46s)]
*  California. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=170.34s)]
*  The newly released book, Califalier, Reversing the Ruin of America's Worst Run State. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=171.34s)]
*  What compelled you to write this? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=177.32s)]
*  Well, it's really a warning to the rest of the country. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=178.66s)]
*  I live in California. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=182.14s)]
*  Those of us who live in California, we know how bad it is. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  But you talk about the Democrats now and where they are. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=186.3s)]
*  The agenda of AOC and Bernie, which seems to be where they're going, that is cali- that's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  what's been implemented in California. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=195.57999999999998s)]
*  That's what we have, the AOC-Bernie agenda. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=198.18s)]
*  And on the back of the book, you can see where it came out. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=200.74s)]
*  The highest poverty rate in the country, highest unemployment, worst homelessness, we pay the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  highest taxes, highest costs for housing, energy, gas, everything. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=208.06s)]
*  So everyone needs to understand how we got here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=212.66s)]
*  That's why I wrote this book. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=215.98000000000002s)]
*  How it happened, but most importantly, how we stop it happening in the rest of the country, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=217.34s)]
*  especially as people are thinking about the midterms and, oh, maybe we'll go back a little [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=222.9s)]
*  bit to the left. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=226.70000000000002s)]
*  That's what we've got in California. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=228.22s)]
*  It's a total failure on every front. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=229.73999999999998s)]
*  I want to play out this sound. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=231.22s)]
*  Kyle Conforti, a California fireman, who says it's hard to think leaders are doing what [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=232.22s)]
*  is best for California based on what's happening. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=237.73999999999998s)]
*  Listen here. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=239.73999999999998s)]
*  It's hard to look at our government structure and think that they're doing what's best for [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=240.73999999999998s)]
*  this state. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  And it hasn't been more evident than with the influx of illegal immigration into this [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  state. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=254.17999999999998s)]
*  When you're paying your taxes and watch them give the money that you paid to other people [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=255.18s)]
*  that haven't even bought into the system, it's discouraging. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=258.90000000000003s)]
*  You think about the mobility of the rich, right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=263.86s)]
*  They don't like what's happening. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  They can move. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  They can leave the state. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=267.78000000000003s)]
*  Not everybody can do that, Steve. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=268.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, should I tell you what happened? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  So that guy, the reason he's in this special failure on Fox Nation is because it's illustrating [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=271.1s)]
*  the impossibility for regular people to live in California because of the costs. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=278.02s)]
*  It made more sense for him as a fireman to move his family to Tennessee because it's [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=281.94s)]
*  cheaper to live there and commute to do his job. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=287.58s)]
*  That's how crazy it's got. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=291.1s)]
*  All the taxes, the regulations, that's what we've got to understand how it happened. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=292.78s)]
*  That's what Califalier does, this book. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=297.82s)]
*  And as I say, we mustn't let it happen across the rest of the country. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=300.3s)]
*  Such a beautiful state. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=304.62s)]
*  So much opportunity there. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=305.62s)]
*  Watch the brand new special, Califalier, with Steve Hilton. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=307.64s)]
*  Thanks so much, Steve. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=311.09999999999997s)]
*  It's available now on FoxNation.com. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=312.09999999999997s)]
*  We appreciate you being here. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=314.97999999999996s)]
*  Great to see you, Son. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=315.97999999999996s)]
*  We'll watch it and we'll read it as well. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66HuruE3l10&t=316.97999999999996s)]
