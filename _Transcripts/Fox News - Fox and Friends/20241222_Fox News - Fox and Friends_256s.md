# 'MAXIMUM DISRUPTION': It's 'obvious' why Amazon workers are striking now
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI)
*  Today, getting that last minute gift may be tricky as the Teamsters Union [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=0.0s)]
*  expands its strike against Amazon. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=5.28s)]
*  And they're not alone. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=7.96s)]
*  Starbucks baristas also ramping up their strike as unions gear up to test President-elect Trump. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=8.88s)]
*  Our next guest warns this could only backfire. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=15.96s)]
*  Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore is here to explain. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=18.92s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Moore. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=22.2s)]
*  And the first question would be, what is the actual impact of the Amazon strike [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=23.92s)]
*  or the Starbucks strike to people watching? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=29.28s)]
*  Well, Peter, good to be with you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=33.2s)]
*  Merry Christmas. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  Look, it's obvious that these workers are striking now to cause maximum disruption. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=36.36s)]
*  I mean, Santa Claus is coming in a few days and those packages have to arrive on time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=44.2s)]
*  I've got I've got four that I just sent out on Amazon, so I certainly hope that they arrive on time. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=48.36s)]
*  But I got to tell you, Peter, right now, today in America, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=54.08s)]
*  only six percent of private sector workers are unionized. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=57.76s)]
*  So unions are pretty much yesterday. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=61.76s)]
*  They're passe, especially in the private sector. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  The workers certainly have a grievance. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=67.12s)]
*  And that grievance is that for the last four years under Joe Biden, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=69.68s)]
*  inflation has been so high, Peter, that wages and salaries for workers like [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=74.48s)]
*  Starbucks workers, like workers at Amazon and all over the country, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=79.52s)]
*  their wages have not kept pace. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=83.6s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons people voted out Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=85.64s)]
*  because the inflation has been so high. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=89.55999999999999s)]
*  And I'm here to tell the workers that are going on strike, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=92.32s)]
*  wait a minute, just stick around. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=96.24s)]
*  Donald Trump is coming in a month. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=97.36s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to get rid of inflation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  He's going to provide higher wages for workers. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=101.24s)]
*  When Trump was president in his first term, we saw huge advances for American workers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=104.96s)]
*  So I hope these strikes don't disrupt people's Christmas season, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=109.0s)]
*  because I do think it could backfire on them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=113.28s)]
*  If you're going to win us, win one of these labor disputes, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  you have to have the public behind you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=117.76s)]
*  And according to Axios, the line is Trump 2.0 looks a lot more pro-union than 1.0. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=119.64s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, I would put it a little differently. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=128.24s)]
*  I'd say that Trump is pro-worker. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=130.36s)]
*  You know, look, there's a big difference between unions and what's good for unions [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  and what's good for workers. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=137.44s)]
*  Oftentimes, we see big unions doing things that are the opposite [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=139.32s)]
*  of what is in the interest of workers. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=144.52s)]
*  In fact, a lot of the major unions endorse Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=146.96s)]
*  when in fact it was Trump who was the one who was most beneficial to worker rights. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=151.4s)]
*  So we will see what happens. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  Look, the workers, this is a miracle. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=158.68s)]
*  Workers have a right to go on strike if they want to. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  But I do worry, I would be worried if I were these Amazon. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, Amazon is a good employer. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=168.44s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=170.36s)]
*  If you start, if you turn your control over to union, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  they're going to take union dues right out of your paycheck, Peter. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=174.52s)]
*  So suddenly, the incoming president seems to have a much better understanding [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=177.88000000000002s)]
*  of the working class, maybe than he did last time. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=181.84s)]
*  Maybe it's because unlike last time, he recently worked at McDonald's. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, that is true. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=190.68s)]
*  I don't know if he had the union card there, but you're exactly right. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  This is a guy who gets middle class America. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=195.24s)]
*  You know, if you look at what happened in the election, there's no question about it [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  that it was it was the middle class. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=201.96s)]
*  It was the working class, Peter, that that voted a mosque for the first time [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=204.16s)]
*  for a Republican president in Donald Trump. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=208.92s)]
*  So he knows who brought him to the White House. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=211.56s)]
*  And he's going to be very attentive to making sure [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=213.96s)]
*  American workers get a better deal. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=217.44s)]
*  Thank you, Steve. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=219.64s)]
*  By the way, can I weigh in on the on the favorite movie? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=221.6s)]
*  I mean, I didn't even ask you that one. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=226.32s)]
*  And I look, where are you guys? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=228.2s)]
*  You're right in the middle of Manhattan. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=231.04s)]
*  I've been watching your show all morning. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't think anybody has mentioned Miracle on 34th Street. Come on. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=234.28s)]
*  Add it to the list. OK. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=240.2s)]
*  Thanks, Steve. All right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=242.6s)]
*  Thanks, guys. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrgeOl-klI&t=244.48s)]
