# Trump greeted by Saudi royal delegation during historic Mideast visit
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk)
*  So let's check in with Lucas Tomlinson. He's live in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia with more on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=0.0s)]
*  president's historic trip. Hey Lucas. Well good morning Ainsley from Riyadh where President Trump [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=5.04s)]
*  has arrived just in the last few hours. We're seeing these historic images from the Saudi [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=11.84s)]
*  Royal Court. President Trump meeting dignitaries alongside Mohammed bin Salman and can't help but [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=16.32s)]
*  just to compare this to a former President Joe Biden's visit to the region back in 2022. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=22.48s)]
*  You can see that the crown prince is not only alongside President Trump, he greeted him right [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=28.48s)]
*  off Air Force One again. That's very different from when Biden visited here just a few years ago. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=34.96s)]
*  Biden did the historic fish bump that was not at the airport and there's no question President [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=41.28s)]
*  Trump arrives here with some headwinds. Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=45.6s)]
*  freed from Gaza, a deal with China, a stock market rally, Steve Witkoff meeting with Iranian [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=50.96s)]
*  officials in neighboring Oman making progress on the nuclear deal. It is notable that the Iranian [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=57.36s)]
*  foreign minister actually came here to Saudi Arabia over the weekend. A few years ago there [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=62.32s)]
*  was a little bit of a rapprochement with Saudi Arabia and Iran brokered by the Chinese and people [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=67.84s)]
*  are wondering why President Trump has made this his first stop. This is an important relationship. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=72.56s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is about the size of Western Europe. It's a top 20 economy. If the United States isn't [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=77.6s)]
*  here, officials say the Chinese will be here. That's why President Trump is here. That's why [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=83.6s)]
*  he's greeting all these dignitaries and the pomp and circumstance has been incredible. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  There was F-15 fighter escort from the Saudi Air Force for Air Force One. Again, Mohamed Ben [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  Salman, the crown prince, greeted President Trump off the aircraft, on the ramp and you've seen all [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=97.52s)]
*  the Trump officials are here too. There's going to be major investments announced, over one trillion [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=104.08s)]
*  dollars in investments from all three countries, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=108.88s)]
*  And keep in mind guys, when President Trump first returned to the White House in January, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=113.44s)]
*  who was his first call to? Which foreign leader? It was to Crown Prince Mohamed Ben Salman. Again, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=117.6s)]
*  just talking about the importance of this relationship. While it's important that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=122.56s)]
*  President Trump arrived here on his first official overseas visit here to Saudi Arabia, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=126.16s)]
*  just like he did during his first term. And there could be other meetings as well. There's a lot [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=131.04s)]
*  happening of course in the region, not just in Gaza, but in Syria. There's a new Sunni leader [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=135.76s)]
*  in Syria and there's a lot of calls from former intelligence officials to say the United States [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=140.32s)]
*  should relax sanctions on Syria. Why? To keep Iran out of the country. For years under the Assad [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=145.44s)]
*  regime, Iran used Syria as a forward operating base. So this can be very busy. Now back here, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=152.48s)]
*  live to the Saudi royal court, you see President Trump meeting all the dignitaries, Crown Prince [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=157.92s)]
*  Mohamed Ben Salman here, the de facto ruler of the country, meeting, standing alongside the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=164.16s)]
*  president, taking time, these historic images. There's no question that the United States and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=169.6s)]
*  the White House want to show Saudi Arabia the importance of this relationship. Remember Brett [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=175.76s)]
*  Baer's interview with the Crown Prince? He said, how close are you to normalizing relations with [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=180.72s)]
*  Israel? He said, we get closer every day. Of course, as Brian mentioned, that was before the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=184.56s)]
*  October 7th massacre. But there's no question President Trump is here to be a leader, to be a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=188.56s)]
*  leader in the world, but also to elevate the Saudi Crown Prince and Saudi Arabian, talk about the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=193.84s)]
*  importance of this important relationship, guys. So Lucas, the big story of F to 9-11, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=199.68s)]
*  which you know intimately well, it's part of you have the military background, was if you're ever [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=208.24s)]
*  going to get terror out of the Middle East, it's got to start with the Wahhabism that's being taught [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=213.04s)]
*  in schools in Saudi Arabia. What type of progress has been made? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=220.0s)]
*  Brian, it's been interesting on the ground the last few days here in Riyadh. Admittedly, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=226.88s)]
*  I came here not expecting to look many women in the eye, to speak to many of them. Instead, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=231.12s)]
*  what I've been told here in just engaging conversation, things have changed a lot in [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=236.96s)]
*  the last five years. Some of the women that have no problem speaking with you, being professional, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=241.36s)]
*  courteous, not all of them wear the full abaya, full covering with just their eyes showing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=246.64s)]
*  People, more Western look is being adopted here. Last night strolling around the streets of Riyadh, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=254.64s)]
*  the coffee shops were open. Of course, no alcohol served here in Saudi Arabia. The coffee shops, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=260.24s)]
*  bakeries open, men and women sitting together. I spoke to a worker at the hotel who said five [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=264.8s)]
*  years ago, he's from Kenya, he said he would only go to work, go home, eat, sleep and come back. Now [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=271.44s)]
*  he says he's free to walk around the streets of Riyadh to talk to people. There's no question [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=278.08s)]
*  there's been a cultural opening, if you will, more Western. We've seen that with Saudi Arabia [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=283.04s)]
*  getting involved in the sports, not only the soccer, the football programs here in Saudi [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=288.64s)]
*  Arabia, but of course the live golf tour. Brian, as you were just reporting from live Derao in Miami, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=292.24s)]
*  you trumped around Miami. Saudi Arabia wants to be a player on the world stage. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=297.36s)]
*  Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, wants to be a player. They're investing over 600 billion [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=303.04s)]
*  dollars into the United States. You're investing billions of dollars into the U.S. This morning, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=307.92s)]
*  I bumped into a McKinsey consultant from France who said that one of the reason, they're there to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=313.76s)]
*  help Saudi Arabia build. We saw in Bret Bares reporting last night all over Riyadh just the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=318.88s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars that has gone into building up the economy here, making it more [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=324.56s)]
*  Western, being open to the West. And that's why President Trump is here and his team is to solidify [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=329.44s)]
*  that because if the United States isn't here, others will be. The Chinese, the Russians and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=334.48s)]
*  Ainsley, you mentioned Saudi Arabia's nuclear program. You know, that's a sore subject with [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=339.76s)]
*  the Iranians because the Saudis have threatened that if Iran is allowed to build nuclear reactors, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=344.16s)]
*  so will they. But it does look like Saudi's moving forward, there's nuclear reactors and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=348.4s)]
*  the crown prince is going to want U.S. help and U.S. businesses to do that. Of course, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=352.4s)]
*  the United States is a leader in nuclear power and nuclear energy. Could there be a compromise [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=355.76s)]
*  when it comes to nuclear power? Could they allow the enrichment, the United States, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=360.96s)]
*  under our supervision and what would that look like? There's certainly a possibility, Ainsley, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=364.96s)]
*  and even Iran has dangled that out to the Trump administration, the Western companies, that if [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=371.12s)]
*  they do have the right to enrich. Now, granted, that is not the Trump policy that we heard from [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  Senator Cotton, we heard from top Trump officials, they don't have the right to enrich. But however, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=380.4s)]
*  if that enrichment could take place outside the country, which is what happens with many [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=384.56s)]
*  other nuclear powers, perhaps there's room to negotiate there with Iran to be able to build [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=388.4s)]
*  nuclear reactors, bring in that enriched uranium, don't spin those tubes there in Iran. And perhaps [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=393.44s)]
*  the same thing here in Saudi Arabia. While it's an oil-rich country, produces 17% of the world's oil, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  no question they're looking for alternative energy. Why to power this AI, the artificial [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=404.4s)]
*  intelligence revolution, guys. Right. And that's why Google's there building a major data center. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=408.72s)]
*  And that's why it's an opportunity for American companies to invest there. And that's why it's [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=414.16s)]
*  important they remain an ally. Great job, Lucas. All that Naval Academy experience right there, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=417.76000000000005s)]
*  definitely coming to play this morning. Thanks, brother. Lucas, really quickly, can I ask you [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=424.0s)]
*  one more thing? You bet. This delegation, we're seeing people shaking hands with the president, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=428.56s)]
*  a lot of individuals. Are they all leaders? Are they, you know, some look like they're more [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  Americanized? Yes, these are political and business leaders. It's really, if you will, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=437.36s)]
*  all the top brass in Saudi Arabia, Ainsley. The who's who of Saudi Arabia is here in Riyadh. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=444.08000000000004s)]
*  And again, the capital of Saudi Arabia, there's no question that this is the highest level of both [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  military and diplomatic honors that the crown prince, you see a woman right there, not with [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=456.8s)]
*  full abeya, just a little example of some of the loosening of restrictions here in the kingdom of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=462.08s)]
*  Saudi Arabia. Wow. So Lucas, well, hang in with us. We're going to bring in Hudson Institute senior [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=466.8s)]
*  fellow, national security analyst, Rebecca Heinrichs. Rebecca, a lot is expected of this trip, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=472.56s)]
*  but by the president picking it first, it means a lot to Saudi Arabia, doesn't it? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=478.0s)]
*  Well, it's massive if you contrast it, as Lucas was saying, to the previous administration, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=484.32s)]
*  which really started its term insulting the Saudis, bringing up, as you brought up, Brian, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=488.8s)]
*  the human rights violations. And it really had a chilly effect on U.S. Saudi and Gulf relations [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=495.04s)]
*  throughout the entire term of the Biden administration. So now the Trump administration [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=502.0s)]
*  is coming in and saying, look, we have some serious overlapping interests. Let's focus on those. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=506.0s)]
*  We care about human rights, but if you really do want to see improvements in human rights across [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=511.92s)]
*  the world, that's a situation in which the United States is the strongest power, which means we got [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=517.68s)]
*  to box out the Chinese. We got to box out where the Chinese are coming into these Gulf states. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=523.04s)]
*  And so first and foremost, you have to have the United States have this close partnership with [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=527.8399999999999s)]
*  the Saudis and the Emiratis in particular. Right, Rebecca. Just a note that with our delegation, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  much smaller, and they just greeted MBS. And there's Suzy Wiles having some quality time with MBS. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=536.56s)]
*  Real quickly, though, Rebecca, this is important because Iran wants to unite the Muslim world, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=542.4s)]
*  the Arab world. And our relationship with the Saudis could stop that. Right. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=549.76s)]
*  Oh, totally. I mean, you want to have the United States. And this is why the Abraham Accords were [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=557.6s)]
*  so successful during the first Trump administration, is because President Trump was clear, we stand with [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=562.0s)]
*  Israel. We're not going to compromise on that. But here, look, we can we can collaborate to [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=566.96s)]
*  counter Iranian hegemony, to counter terrorism throughout the Middle East. And we can do that [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=571.76s)]
*  collaboration with you, Saudi Arabia, with you, United Arab Emirates. And remember, it was the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=576.72s)]
*  United States with the Saudis and the Emiratis that that took care of the Houthis during the first [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=581.52s)]
*  Trump administration. All of that really was was set back during the Biden administration, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=585.84s)]
*  whenever the United States didn't have such a close relationship with the Saudis. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=591.76s)]
*  You're pointing out Ainsley. Yeah, we were trying to. We thought it was Jeff Bezos from the back, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=595.92s)]
*  but when he turned around, I don't think so. There's David Sacks. So, yeah, it looks like [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=600.72s)]
*  the businessmen and women who made the trip are also being. And Rebecca, talk about that, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=605.28s)]
*  because Elon's there, Mark Zuckerberg's there. I know that Saudi Arabia wants access to U.S. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=610.08s)]
*  technologies to advance their AI, their semiconductors for tech. And that is a way that [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=615.2s)]
*  President Trump could ice out China, correct? Oh, yeah, you want to ice out the Chinese and [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=620.32s)]
*  you want the United States to be the preeminent power. So you have to look to see where the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=626.88s)]
*  advantages of your partners, they're going to be working on this kind of technology. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=630.88s)]
*  They want to lead on it. They want to be a leading participant. And so you want to kind of hug them [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=635.6s)]
*  close. You want to know what they're working on. You want United States to benefit from it, to [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=640.08s)]
*  leverage their advances. And so the closer we can work with them and find mutual interests, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=643.84s)]
*  the better it's going to be. Again, during the Biden administration, a lot of these countries [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=649.12s)]
*  did look to China and to Russia. And it's an axis. It's the Chinese, the Russians, the Iranians and [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=653.04s)]
*  the North Koreans. They're all looking to box us out. So to the extent we can pull these countries [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=658.0799999999999s)]
*  into orbit, our orbit, the better. Rebecca, what do you think what what do you think the Iranians [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=662.4s)]
*  are up to? Multiple visits to Saudi Arabia prior to the U.S. arriving. We have a fourth round of [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=667.8399999999999s)]
*  talks with Iran. Many people, I don't know anybody who believes that Iran is actually going to [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=674.48s)]
*  dismantle their nuclear program. Why are they running to Saudi Arabia? They're our enemy before [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=679.28s)]
*  this visit. What do you think's going on? Well, they're looking for deals. I mean, at this region, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=684.24s)]
*  again, this is a dealmaking region. And I think the Iranians probably want the Saudis to to find [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=690.48s)]
*  areas where the two of them can mutually benefit against the United States, try to triangulate. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=696.24s)]
*  So you all were talking about the civil nuclear program. The Saudis want to have one as well. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=701.1999999999999s)]
*  Again, but the United States does not want if you do not have a nuclear program, we do not want you [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=706.8s)]
*  to get a nuclear program. So potentially you could have some development outside your country of [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=711.28s)]
*  enrichment. We could bring that in. But the Saudis are not going to get something that the Iranians [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=716.24s)]
*  want that we're going to prohibit to the Iranians. So potentially they're collaborating on that front. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=720.32s)]
*  Or the the Iranians might be trying to get the Saudis to say we need the United States to [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=725.36s)]
*  recognize a Palestinian state. I think that's a deal breaker for the United States. After October [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=730.8s)]
*  7th, you're not going to have October 7th, that terrible genocidal event against the Israelis [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=735.76s)]
*  be the event that precipitates something like a breakthrough, like a recognition of a Palestinian [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=740.96s)]
*  state. But I would I would suspect that that's something that the Iranians would want. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=745.04s)]
*  And real quickly, Rebecca, you got Elon Musk right there with the Crown Prince and the President [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=748.4s)]
*  United States having this thorough conversation. As you can see, he's getting more time than the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=752.96s)]
*  rest of the business community respected by everybody around the world for his technology. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=757.36s)]
*  It's just got some knuckleheads in Seattle want to burn tests. Exactly. We don't care. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=763.2s)]
*  Rebecca, can we get back to what you were talking about when it comes to the Palestinian state? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=766.72s)]
*  There has to be some middle ground though, right? Hamas has to go. But it looks like a lot of people [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=772.0s)]
*  in the Arab and Muslim world, the thought of there not being a Palestinian state [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=778.16s)]
*  worries them. And it seems like it's a deal breaker for them. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=786.48s)]
*  I think you made an important point, though, earlier, which is that they don't want to take [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=793.2s)]
*  any of the individuals in Gaza, though, that are suffering under really it's Hamas fault that [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=798.08s)]
*  they're suffering. But the Israelis are trying to take out Hamas the best that they can. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=804.64s)]
*  And I would just suggest, look, there is there's plenty of Muslim states, more than two dozen [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=809.04s)]
*  Muslim states. And any of these golf partners can can take more of the individuals who are currently [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=813.6s)]
*  residing in Gaza. I mean, and I would say there's only one Jewish state. And so I think that that [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=820.08s)]
*  after again, after October 7th, the world has changed. And so that might be something that's [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=825.76s)]
*  important to them. But again, I think President Trump has enormous power and leverage and he can [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=830.64s)]
*  strike other deals with them. That would be important and bring true and lasting peace. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=836.32s)]
*  And I think, again, it's going to be staying really close with our partners, our allies, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=840.0s)]
*  the Israelis. Hey, Rebecca, last question for this for this portion of our program. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=843.6s)]
*  We watched the delegation, the American delegation meet the crown prince. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=848.24s)]
*  How how disturbed or how worried are the Israelis that we are not necessarily communicating with them [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=853.52s)]
*  like we were earlier and that maybe a lot of these talks and the deal with the Houthi rebels [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=860.88s)]
*  was done without their consultation, the Alexander negotiations, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=867.04s)]
*  without them intimately involved? How worried are they? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=870.56s)]
*  I think that there is I think we've got to be honest, they're nervous of the first [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=872.88s)]
*  administration's success. Again, I would return to what worked the first time, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=879.28s)]
*  holding the Israelis very close, even as you extend an open hand to the Gulf partners. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=883.52s)]
*  That seems to be a little bit different this time, although our ambassador in Israel, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=888.0s)]
*  Mike Huckabee, has said no, our United States is still ironclad committed to Israel. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=892.08s)]
*  So there might be just a little bit of disinformation happening in the media. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=896.16s)]
*  We kind of have to sit tight and be patient. But I would understand. I would understand why [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=899.44s)]
*  the Israelis would feel a little bit uncomfortable. I would just encourage, you know, our administration [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=903.52s)]
*  and the Bibi and Yahoo administration to make sure that they're standing shoulder to shoulder [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=907.6s)]
*  after all this trip and to demonstrate that there's no light between us. Yeah, Israel will always be [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=911.2s)]
*  an ally of America. That goes back to biblical times. So it's just it's a commitment that we [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=916.72s)]
*  as a country, as a Christian country have made. But thank you so much. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OidoDWaDHgk&t=923.76s)]
