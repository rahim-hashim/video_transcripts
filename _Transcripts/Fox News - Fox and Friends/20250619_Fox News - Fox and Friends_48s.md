*  Too many communities have seen it happen right in their own neighborhoods where masked individuals [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co2tbbjedFI&t=0.0s)]
*  who are not wearing badges openly or identification are coming in unmarked vehicles, jumping out, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co2tbbjedFI&t=6.88s)]
*  snatching people off the streets. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co2tbbjedFI&t=14.24s)]
*  I'm just stating that these tactics are the opposite of what makes communities safer. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co2tbbjedFI&t=15.76s)]

*  but they're upset that ICE is wearing face coverings. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co2tbbjedFI&t=39.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co2tbbjedFI&t=42.52s)]
*  Because they're being doxed and their families being targeted. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co2tbbjedFI&t=43.52s)]
