# Chilling messages found on shell casings at UnitedHealthcare CEO murder scene: Report
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE)
*  Fox News alert at 19 minutes before the top of the hour. The suspect man screen left right [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=0.0s)]
*  there in United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson's cold blooded murder still on the run at this [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=8.26s)]
*  hour. As new reports say Thompson was one of several executives reportedly facing a [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=14.26s)]
*  Department of Investigation investigation for insider trading. Here to discuss we've [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=19.5s)]
*  got former federal prosecutor and criminal defense attorney Andrew Cherkoski. Andrew [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=25.86s)]
*  thanks for making the trip out to Long Island. When you watch the video what does it look [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=30.42s)]
*  like to you? It looks like somebody who's a somebody trained in firearms somebody who's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=35.1s)]
*  capable of using it. He does he looks insensitive to the fact that he's killing somebody so [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=40.1s)]
*  there's some degree of preparation a lot of thought and he was ready to do it. Whether [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  that means he's a trained assassin like some people are saying perhaps it's a step short [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=50.9s)]
*  of that that he just had practiced a lot with the firearm but there is definitely a strong [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=55.739999999999995s)]
*  motive there. I think that what we see in that video is somebody who is who is very [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=60.3s)]
*  committed to following through with this crime and so now there's all sorts of speculation [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=65.34s)]
*  about what that motive could have been and and whether that might lead us to actually [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=70.14s)]
*  finding him. Okay so that picture right there I believe is taken in a nearby Starbucks [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  and this was before the shooting and the guy bought a couple of power bars and bought a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=79.46s)]
*  water and got a cup and so presumably there would be DNA on that thing obviously the cops [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=84.74s)]
*  have already hoovered up everything in that Starbucks but if he is a trained killer he's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=92.06s)]
*  probably wearing gloves. Well there's the probability that he might be wearing gloves [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=96.86s)]
*  although we see in the video when he's holding the gun it looks like he doesn't have that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=101.5s)]
*  so are they running that DNA are they actually getting something back or perhaps that's something [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=105.34s)]
*  in the garbage can that that fellow kind of was that disappeared. I'm most interested [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=110.1s)]
*  in the bike he went to a bicycle city bike and whether the tracking software on that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=115.86s)]
*  to be able to figure out where that bike went. X has some people speculating about that but [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=122.02s)]
*  I'm sure the police are deep into all of that on-ground canvassing and looking at every [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=126.62s)]
*  piece they can. And as people get up on this Thursday morning the latest tantalizing clues [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=132.42s)]
*  come from I believe the New York Post where apparently on three of the shell casings these [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=137.61999999999998s)]
*  three shell casings there are the words somebody has etched the word deny, depose, defend which [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=142.01999999999998s)]
*  also happens to be probably a coincidence maybe not the name of a book about how insurance [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=149.54s)]
*  companies operate and how they essentially work to not pay you. Right so there's many [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=155.45999999999998s)]
*  motives that I think people are identifying as a possibility is this somebody who's disgruntled [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=161.18s)]
*  with United Healthcare because of a denied coverage something along that line or is this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=165.9s)]
*  somebody potentially connected to this DOJ investigation worried that perhaps he had [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=170.5s)]
*  information that they didn't want released or many other reasons but if this is actually [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  somebody who's put in a lot of thought and and was kind of an assassin here could it [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=179.8s)]
*  have been misdirection to write something on those bullets to make it look like somebody [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=184.86s)]
*  who had a problem with the insurance company but had a different motive instead. So there's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  a lot of different ways this can go the police have to be very careful not to jump to conclusions [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=193.5s)]
*  to avoid not finding the actual suspect they're just they're canvassing as much as they possibly [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=198.38000000000002s)]
*  can and look at looking at every possibility. Misdirection. I never thought about that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=204.62s)]
*  You have to be open to that. Hey look into the book maybe it's that kind of person. We [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  don't know yet. Let's see if they catch them today. Andrew thank you very much. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZe9PUXbSE&t=214.3s)]
