# BREAKING: Trump celebrates legal win in California National Guard dispute
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY)
*  So, overnight, a legal win for the president's push to restore law and order in LA. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=0.0s)]
*  As the federal court rules, he can keep the National Guard deployed there as protests [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=5.12s)]
*  rage across Los Angeles. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=9.64s)]
*  Moments ago, President Trump reacting on Truth Social saying, quote, if I didn't send the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=11.4s)]
*  military into Los Angeles, that city would be burning to the ground right now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=15.76s)]
*  We saved LA. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=20.64s)]
*  Thank you for the decision. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=22.16s)]
*  Former federal prosecutor Jonathan Fahey served as the acting ICE director under President [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=23.88s)]
*  Trump's first term, and he joins us now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=28.28s)]
*  Jonathan, thanks so much for joining the program this morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=30.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=34.84s)]
*  You know, it's really hard to follow the courts on this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=35.84s)]
*  You had that decision late in the evening and then you got one overnight from the courts. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=39.2s)]
*  But I think when you look at the mayor, they're going to stand with the president on this [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  issue, right? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  I think you're exactly right. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=50.88s)]
*  And it's certainly not, it's probably not over in the court system. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=52.6s)]
*  This will ultimately be heard by the Ninth Circuit and then possibly the Supreme Court. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=55.4s)]
*  But the merits that President Trump is on are very strong. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=59.96s)]
*  This statute allows him to bring in the National Guard when he decides that there is an interference [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=63.8s)]
*  with federal agencies doing their jobs. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=69.8s)]
*  And clearly that was the case here. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=72.28s)]
*  It's not even arguable that these rioters, their whole intent was to prevent the ICE [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=73.96s)]
*  from doing their jobs. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=79.6s)]
*  That was their stated purpose. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=80.6s)]
*  And what makes this case even more unique is California wasn't even trying to help. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=81.84s)]
*  It's not like their local law enforcement was trying to help and they were unsuccessful. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=88.0s)]
*  They were at least in spirit with the rioters in this case. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=92.28s)]
*  President Trump was not only right, it was his responsibility to do so and things would [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=96.64s)]
*  have gotten a whole lot worse if he didn't. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=101.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just one of those cases where you see the Democrats continue using the courts [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=103.2s)]
*  to delay because they realize that it's really not under real good legal footing, but they [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=109.08s)]
*  don't care. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=114.4s)]
*  It's delay delay. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=115.4s)]
*  I want to get your attention to Senator Padilla because yesterday he was removed from the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=116.4s)]
*  Secretary of Homeland Security's presser and this is how he behaved. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=120.4s)]
*  Watch. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=124.52s)]
*  Hands up, hands up. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=125.52s)]
*  I'm Senator Alex Padilla. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=126.52s)]
*  I have questions for the Secretary because the fact of the matter is a half a dozen violent [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=129.96s)]
*  criminals that you're rotating on your hands off. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=135.96s)]
*  Hands on your back. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=142.0s)]
*  Hands on your back. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=146.0s)]
*  Let me get up. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=147.0s)]
*  My hands going. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=148.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=149.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=150.0s)]
*  Cool. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=151.0s)]
*  Hands. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=152.0s)]
*  Lay flat. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=153.0s)]
*  Lay flat. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=154.0s)]
*  So it was clearly a political stunt, right? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=155.0s)]
*  Clearly a political stunt and really bizarre behavior for a United States senator to act [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=158.68s)]
*  like this is somehow legitimate. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=163.64s)]
*  And what makes this even worse is the reaction of other Democrats to this because the other [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=166.16s)]
*  Democrats have essentially said that he was in the right here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=172.16s)]
*  He has every right to go in and disrupt a press conference, lunge towards the stage [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=176.64s)]
*  and they act like Donald Trump or somehow behind us. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=181.76s)]
*  These were law enforcement officers there to protect the secretary and they did what [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=185.04s)]
*  they were supposed to do. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=189.68s)]
*  This idea that they should have known there would be an unhinged senator there. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=191.36s)]
*  And by the way, nobody outside of maybe the inside inside the Beltway world knows who [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  Senator Padilla even is. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=201.12s)]
*  But this idea that they should have known who he was and somehow if he is an unhinged [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  Democratic senator, he has free reigns to go to the podium. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=207.68s)]
*  It's so unbelievably bizarre. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think a question for them would be if somebody barges into their office saying they [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=213.88000000000002s)]
*  want to ask the senator a question, are they going to stop this person or are they just [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=217.76s)]
*  going to let him through? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=221.44s)]
*  Because everything that law enforcement did was appropriate here. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  There was nothing political about it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=227.12s)]
*  And the Democrats, again, this kind of goes back to the first topic. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=229.12s)]
*  All they want to do is create chaos because on the merits of their positions, they can't [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  win. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  So they want to create some chaos and be disruptive. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=239.12s)]
*  But disgraceful performance by him, but even worse by the other Democrats who were supporting [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  him. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, Jonathan, it also goes to the original sin, which is ICE was trying to do operations [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  and they were prevented from doing that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=253.84s)]
*  This senator is essentially doing the same thing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=256.0s)]
*  So he made the argument if they treat me this way, how are they going to treat other Americans? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, you got if the senator is behaving this way when a government official is trying to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  do their job, what are the agents supposed to do? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=269.04s)]
*  Right, Jonathan? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=272.8s)]
*  Well, exactly like how are they supposed to treat him? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=274.56s)]
*  It's like, wait, are you supposed to just be able to charge into a press conference [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=277.36s)]
*  and go out to the secretary? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=282.0s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=283.6s)]
*  And you're absolutely right on your point that he's doing what these rioters were doing. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=284.56s)]
*  And these ICE agents, to begin with, were serving judicial warrants, meaning initiated [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=289.44s)]
*  by a federal judge to do what they were doing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=294.56s)]
*  So they've been in the right the entire time. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=297.12s)]
*  The administration's been in the right the entire time. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  If he truly wanted to talk to the secretary, he should make an appointment or make a phone [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=301.92s)]
*  call. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  The whole thing is nonsense. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  It's disgraceful. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=309.04s)]
*  But again, they have no leg to stand on on the merits. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  So they have to resort to these theatrics. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  And it's just embarrassing for him and the rest of the Democrats. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=316.8s)]
*  He's trying to increase his name ID. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=320.88s)]
*  I guess he's looking for a run to. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  Jonathan Fahey, we appreciate you coming on the program. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=325.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=329.44s)]
*  Kill me. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aw2qqZeyxY&t=331.92s)]
