# Hosts address big questions on Trump tariffs: 'Never seen this before'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo)
*  All right, here we go. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=0.0s)]
*  Liberation Day. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=1.84s)]
*  President Trump is set to roll out a wave of tariffs to advance America first's economic [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=2.84s)]
*  agenda. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=7.12s)]
*  It's going to rebalance trade. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  And the White House says they're going to go into effect immediately. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=9.46s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson joins us live from Washington. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Good morning, Lucas. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=14.72s)]
*  Good morning, Lawrence Ainsley. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=16.16s)]
*  And friends, today is what President Trump calls Liberation Day, when these new tariffs [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=17.68s)]
*  will be rolled out. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Champions of free trade going back to Adam Smith's invisible hand don't believe they [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=22.32s)]
*  will work. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=26.28s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt says they will. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=27.96s)]
*  They will be effective immediately. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  And the president has been teasing this for quite some time, as they're not going to be [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=33.24s)]
*  wrong. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=36.28s)]
*  It is going to work. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=37.28s)]
*  And the president has a brilliant team of advisers who have been studying these issues [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=38.28s)]
*  for decades. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=42.24s)]
*  And we are focused on restoring the golden age of America and making America manufacturing [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=44.08s)]
*  superpower. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=48.84s)]
*  Now, while details are not immediately clear, this is what we know ahead of President Trump's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=49.84s)]
*  address this afternoon. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=53.68s)]
*  The reciprocal tariffs could be less than what other countries charge the U.S. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=54.88s)]
*  Rates may vary depending on country. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=59.48s)]
*  The new tariffs could also apply to all countries. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=61.36s)]
*  And sector-specific products such as steel and aluminum imports are already subject to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=64.44s)]
*  a 25 percent tariff. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=68.84s)]
*  And the car and auto parts import tariff are expected to begin today. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=70.24s)]
*  The money will begin collecting, coming in tomorrow. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=74.2s)]
*  And Goldman Sachs has raised the odds of recession in the U.S. to 35 percent. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=77.56s)]
*  White House trade adviser Peter Navarro says the new tariffs will bring in $6 trillion [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=81.92s)]
*  over the next decade, which is being called the largest peacetime tax hike in modern history, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=86.28s)]
*  which will be paid for by the American consumer. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=91.32s)]
*  Navarro said the auto tariffs alone will bring in $100 billion per year. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=93.84s)]
*  And President Trump has acknowledged prices could rise, but said people are going to start [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=98.0s)]
*  buying American-made cars, guys. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  Lucas, could we have last-minute deals, too? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=103.6s)]
*  We saw Vietnam and Israel change their trade structure. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=106.08s)]
*  We accepted that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=109.24s)]
*  Could the president be working the phones today, getting calls from other countries? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  With President Trump, of course, he's known as a dealmaker, guys. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=114.0s)]
*  You saw what Israel did. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=116.56s)]
*  They zeroed out their tariffs in the United States. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=117.84s)]
*  Perhaps we could have some last-minute deals. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=119.68s)]
*  All it takes is a post on X. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=121.72s)]
*  There you go. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=124.0s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=125.0s)]
*  And Lucas, did you say that one of those big investment firms says there's a 35 percent [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=126.0s)]
*  chance of a recession now? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=130.12s)]
*  I did, Steve. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=132.08s)]
*  Goldman Sachs, they raised up to 35 percent. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=133.08s)]
*  It was like 15, 20 percent earlier because of the tariffs. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=135.96s)]
*  You'll have to watch the markets for the opening bill. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=139.28s)]
*  Thank you, Lucas. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=141.56s)]
*  Lots to talk about. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=142.56s)]
*  Lucas, thank you very much. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=143.56s)]
*  He mentioned we've got to watch the markets. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=144.84s)]
*  Originally, this announcement was supposed to be at 3 o'clock in the afternoon in the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=146.76s)]
*  Rose Garden. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=149.92s)]
*  But then they moved it back smartly because however whatever is announced is going to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=151.48s)]
*  impact the markets. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=157.88s)]
*  What Wall Street hopes is there is some clarity because right now, businesses, they can't [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=159.48s)]
*  plan because they don't know is it going to be drip-straps, they're going to announce [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=164.64s)]
*  something today, something else next week. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=168.24s)]
*  They need to know long term whether or not they should invest money in new plants here [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=170.96s)]
*  in the United States because the worry is if they invest to build a factory here in [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=175.52s)]
*  the U.S. and then in a year or two or three or four free trade comes back, they get screwed [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=180.36s)]
*  by putting all that money back here. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  All of this is because Trump wants free and fair trade. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=188.84s)]
*  He doesn't want America to be taken advantage of and we have under past administrations. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=192.08s)]
*  He says not under my watch. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  You mentioned Vietnam. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=197.76s)]
*  Vietnam has already cut duties on U.S. imports because of this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=198.76s)]
*  They've cut its tariffs in LNG. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=202.6s)]
*  They cut it down to 2 percent from 5 percent. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  Cars down to 32 percent. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  Originally it was 45 to 64 percent. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=208.6s)]
*  Ethanol 5 percent. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=211.04s)]
*  It was 10 percent. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=212.73999999999998s)]
*  In India, they reduced tariffs on motorcycles and whiskeys. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=214.29999999999998s)]
*  Mexico, they deployed those 10,000 troops to the border to help with the immigration [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=217.04s)]
*  problem. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  The EU is proposing lowering tariffs on car imports from 10 percent, closer to the 2.5 [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  percent that Donald Trump wants. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=227.96s)]
*  Canada unveiled a 1.3 billion dollar security plan for the U.S. and pledged to have this [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=228.96s)]
*  fentanyl czar. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  So those are some examples. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=234.96s)]
*  But as far as investments are concerned, Johnson & Johnson investing 55 billion. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=236.24s)]
*  We heard from Apple 500 billion. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=240.58s)]
*  SoftBank OpenAI Oracle 100 billion. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=243.36s)]
*  Hyundai 20 billion in the U.S. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=245.8s)]
*  Nissan 661 million. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  Eli Lilly 27 billion. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=250.16000000000003s)]
*  So it's working. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=252.08s)]
*  Those are investments. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=253.12s)]
*  It might, in the short term, be a little painful for Americans, but overall, this is about [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  being fair. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=258.52s)]
*  A lot of it has to do with this unplowed ground. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=259.52s)]
*  We've never seen this before. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=261.72s)]
*  These are 10 times as big as the tariffs the president had last time. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  They were so effective. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=266.6s)]
*  Joe Biden left them all in place. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=267.6s)]
*  Everyone said the sky was going to fall. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=269.72s)]
*  It didn't. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=271.36s)]
*  These are about the size of William McKinley's, where he raised taxes on imports 50 percent [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=272.36s)]
*  in the 1890s. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=278.0s)]
*  And it is the template President Trump is one with. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=279.0s)]
*  Steve, you mentioned about building factories here. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  And are we going to build a factory here and then end up zeroing out the tariffs? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=285.08s)]
*  I don't think it's ever not going to benefit under the Trump years any company from coming [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  back to America. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=292.44s)]
*  Down to zero, we're coming to America. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=293.44s)]
*  That's one of the things they balanced out in the 80s. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=295.2s)]
*  Everything was targeted. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  When Donald Trump first came out and said Japan's our problem, and cars, we're losing [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  our leadership in cars, all of a sudden Japan goes, what if I build Toyotas by you? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=303.2s)]
*  What if I brought Honda there? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=307.88s)]
*  And then we began to rebalance and throughout most of the South, you got the Hyundai away [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=309.54s)]
*  from the unions, the Honda and the Toyota. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=313.94s)]
*  And Apple in Texas. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=317.14000000000004s)]
*  One person that continues to be a great messenger, not just for the Republican Party, but for [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=319.14000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump, knowing that Trump speak is Kellyanne Conway. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  I think this has become a patriotic message. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=327.26s)]
*  You build here. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=330.70000000000005s)]
*  This is for our workers here. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=332.3s)]
*  It's a national security issue. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  We can't be getting our PPE. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=335.82000000000005s)]
*  We saw what happened during the pandemic. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=337.56s)]
*  We're getting all of this stuff from other countries. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=339.34s)]
*  Kellyanne Conway explained what the president is trying to do. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=341.38s)]
*  President Trump is using tariffs to one, raise revenues for this country, to to recalibrate [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=347.58s)]
*  and make more reciprocal our trade imbalance with other countries. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=353.1s)]
*  You listed all the ones which are egregious violations of any kind of common sense and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=357.1s)]
*  fairness, Sean. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=361.74s)]
*  And also, President Trump is trying to protect American sovereignty, American security, American [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=363.82s)]
*  manufacturing, American jobs, America herself. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=369.90000000000003s)]
*  I think President Trump would tell a lot of these companies, if not countries, tariffs [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=373.66s)]
*  are not his choice. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=377.90000000000003s)]
*  They're your choice. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=379.62s)]
*  If you don't want these tariffs, then start building more factories here, expanding your [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=380.74s)]
*  facility capacity, investing more in American workers, American innovation. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=384.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=389.5s)]
*  And that's what we've heard from the administration. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=390.54s)]
*  And they're putting all their eggs in that basket. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=392.58s)]
*  If it works, it will be fantastic. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=394.42s)]
*  But it is a gigantic experiment. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=396.38s)]
*  It sounds like right now the conventional wisdom is rather than the little deals, the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=399.18s)]
*  little side deals with everybody and reciprocal, OK, you do 2 percent on us. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=403.42s)]
*  It will probably be a 20 percent universal tariff, which is across the board. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=408.32s)]
*  If they implement that, which would be immediate, according to the White House, it would bring [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=414.94s)]
*  the effective U.S. tariff rate to almost 33 percent, which is the highest since 1872, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=419.42s)]
*  which Brian, what you were talking about, McKinley with the very high rates back then. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=427.14000000000004s)]
*  Thirty three percent is a big number. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=432.3s)]
*  And I know there are a lot of people who are on fixed incomes who are watching, you know, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=433.82s)]
*  they're watching their 401K account go down. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=438.74s)]
*  Let's just hope today's announcement brings some finality and some clarity, because right [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=442.92s)]
*  now they don't have that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=447.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=448.06s)]
*  The one thing about Trump I noticed is that when things are tense, he gets the calm. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=449.7s)]
*  So when they attack his family is a little different. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=454.02s)]
*  But you'll see ice in the veins through. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=455.98s)]
*  He really feels as though this has been his vision since 1990s. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=459.22s)]
*  This is the World War Two structure of trade. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=462.78000000000003s)]
*  He wants to balance it out. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=465.04s)]
*  And when you take these titanic plates and move them, there's going to be rumbling. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=466.38s)]
*  People are going to get dislodged. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=470.06s)]
*  But hopefully it's going to get adhesed and the foundation will be real strong. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=471.26s)]
*  Trump said, wait for the tax cuts, wait for them to pass the one big beautiful bill, then [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=476.52s)]
*  do this. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=480.08s)]
*  Well, he's doing it the reverse because it could take to the summer to get to get that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=481.08s)]
*  pet. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0gu-u04uEo&t=484.96s)]
