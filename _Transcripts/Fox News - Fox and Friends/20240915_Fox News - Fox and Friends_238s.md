# ‘NO MORE FLUFF’: Gen Z voter makes plea to faith leaders amid religious decline
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0)
*  A new survey revealing more Americans than ever are not affiliated with religion and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=0.0s)]
*  those leading the jump are younger Gen X and older millennials with nearly 50% no longer [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=7.76s)]
*  feeling tied to any religion at all. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=14.08s)]
*  So why the shift? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=16.96s)]
*  Gen Z voter and Fire and Freedom podcast host Carolyn Joyas joins us now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=18.2s)]
*  Hi Carolyn, great to have you on this morning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=23.12s)]
*  Let's talk about it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=26.16s)]
*  Why do you think this trend is happening? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=27.16s)]
*  What are young people thinking? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=29.32s)]
*  First of all, it's so great to be with you again. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=30.32s)]
*  Thank you guys for having me on. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=33.4s)]
*  But I think what it really comes down to is Gen Z is desperately searching for something [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=34.56s)]
*  authentic. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=39.68s)]
*  We've grown up in this fabricated world of social media. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=40.68s)]
*  We've constantly been thrown, you know, this information in these filtered, these filtered, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  you know, ideas of what of what truth is. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=51.32s)]
*  But we're really searching for something real. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=54.96s)]
*  We're really searching for something authentic. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=57.24s)]
*  And we can't find that in relationship. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=60.08s)]
*  And when we can't find that in religion, we can only find that in relationship. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=62.08s)]
*  So what we're searching for isn't religion. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=65.08s)]
*  But what we're searching for is relationship. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=67.08s)]
*  Well, I have to believe that the decrease in the trust in institutions also has a lot [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=70.08s)]
*  to do with that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=74.08s)]
*  But let's talk about what happened. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=75.08s)]
*  Look at these numbers here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=76.08s)]
*  So you have there's a 4% increase in unaffiliated Gen Z or 7% increase in religiously unidentified [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=78.08s)]
*  boomers. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=85.08s)]
*  So you have those numbers. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=86.08s)]
*  We also have the unaffiliated among political parties. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  So 33% of Democrats are unaffiliated with any religion. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  12% of Republicans are unaffiliated. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  We're also seeing a decrease even, you know, in people identifying as Christians. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  So I just want to talk about what happens to the country when less people identify themselves [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  as Christians, when so many of our rights are rooted in Christianity. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  What does that do to the country? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  That's a very good question. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  And like you said, America is a Christian nation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=117.0s)]
*  We're founded on Christian morals. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=119.0s)]
*  So how is America supposed to stand if Americans aren't believing in those same rules? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=121.0s)]
*  And the truth of the matter is that I know people aren't going to like me saying this, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=126.0s)]
*  but without Christians in America taking a stand, without Christians in America being [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=130.0s)]
*  the backbone of this country, America will not stand. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=135.0s)]
*  We will. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=138.0s)]
*  We will totally falter because we will no longer have a basis of truth. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=139.0s)]
*  No, there's no question about it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=143.0s)]
*  I think it absolutely changes our understanding of where our rights come from, which fundamentally [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=145.96s)]
*  changes the country in many, I think, negative ways. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=149.96s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit about what you said, how they don't want to go to church. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=152.96s)]
*  They're looking for something more authentic. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=155.96s)]
*  I think something might get lost in that, Carolyn, in that, you know, so many people [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=158.96s)]
*  get support from having a church community. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=162.96s)]
*  I mean, I'm so worried about young people anyway, you know, working from home, remote [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=165.96s)]
*  work. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=170.96s)]
*  They're not interacting enough. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=171.96s)]
*  Now they're saying, I can do my own religion thing without a church community. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  100%. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, we've seen this time and time again. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  Even the government has tried to take the place of churches when really, you know, it's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  up to the churches to step in and be the community and help those and give not handouts, but [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  hand ups. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  And if we don't have the church as the backbone, then we will definitely lose our country. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  Really fast. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  What can church leaders do to bring young people back into the pews? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  We can speak the biblical truth because that is what Gen Z is desperately searching for. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=202.88s)]
*  We aren't searching for fluff anymore. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=207.88s)]
*  We're searching for authenticity. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=209.88s)]
*  We're searching for a word that convicts us that we know is real, that we know is alive. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=210.88s)]
*  And we're not going to get that unless our preachers are willing to take a stand and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=214.88s)]
*  to speak the truth boldly and unapologetically. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=218.88s)]
*  All right, Carolyn, joyous, great words. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=221.88s)]
*  Thanks for joining us this morning. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=223.88s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=225.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZmVWXFXo0&t=226.88s)]
