# Disturbing details revealed of Hamas' treatment of child hostages
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg)
*  Hey, back with the Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=0.0s)]
*  A live look right now of smoke over Gaza's fighting resumed this morning. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Israeli officials saying Hamas violated the terms of their ceasefire. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=7.12s)]
*  This is the IDF reveals. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=10.52s)]
*  Child hostages taken by the terror group were drugged and branded like cattle. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=12.24s)]
*  Fox News senior strategic analyst and retired four-star General Jack Keene on the breaking [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  developments. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=20.0s)]
*  General, first off, does it surprise you? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=21.0s)]
*  Children number one taken and number two treated like that? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=24.32s)]
*  Well we know from the outset that Hamas completely changed its tactics on October the 7th. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=30.0s)]
*  One, the focus on killing civilians versus the IDF and then taking wholesale hostages [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=35.44s)]
*  to include women, children and also barbaric treatment of them as it's now unfolding. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  It's not surprising but it's certainly profoundly disappointing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  These people are monsters and I believe that the national leadership in Israel has got [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=52.96s)]
*  it right. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=58.08s)]
*  We've got to eliminate the effectiveness of this organization as a military terrorist [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  organization and certainly as a government in Gaza and the job is not over until that's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=63.48s)]
*  done. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=70.8s)]
*  So we understand too they're going to move towards the south but they told a lot of the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=71.8s)]
*  civilians go to the south so they're opening up an evacuation zone to Ra'afah because [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=75.28s)]
*  they're going to go into Khan Yunis, I apologize if I didn't say those names correctly, so [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=81.32s)]
*  they're going to go hit there right away. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=85.72s)]
*  General, I would assume that with the satellites in the sky or the drones flying, they saw [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  possibly where a lot of these hostages came out from and may be poised to do a rescue [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=92.08s)]
*  operation for the rest. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  Is that just me hoping or is that plausible? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=99.32s)]
*  I think it's very challenging. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Certainly Hamas is very much aware of the potential of something like that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=106.16s)]
*  One, even if we have some sense of where they are, can we get in there and get them out [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=110.11999999999999s)]
*  without harm to them? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=115.8s)]
*  Certainly Hamas at the point of confrontation, they know someone's coming for them, they [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=117.64s)]
*  would likely kill them. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=123.24s)]
*  That's normal for hostage takers. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=126.4s)]
*  So yeah, this is a challenging operation. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=129.5s)]
*  I think the most likely one is the one is the path we've been on. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=131.32s)]
*  It's in Hamas' interest to use the hostages as leverage to delay Israel's operational [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=135.36s)]
*  campaign and two, to protect the regime leaders at the end of this thing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=142.72s)]
*  That is why they're going to hold on to a certain tranche of them to guarantee that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=147.76s)]
*  these leaders are going to live on. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=151.8s)]
*  Whether that actually happens or not remains to be seen. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=153.88s)]
*  General, the word is from our administration to the Israelis. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=156.56s)]
*  Don't do in the south, don't do in the south, do in the north. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=161.64s)]
*  Go into the building, don't blow it up from the sky. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=164.84s)]
*  Be less, more precise with your attacks to avoid civilian casualties. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=168.12s)]
*  How do you, if you're Israel, how do you take that advice? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=174.36s)]
*  Well first of all, Israel is always going to listen to the United States because the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=179.16s)]
*  United States is their indispensable ally. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=183.08s)]
*  They would have a very difficult time going it alone without the support of the United [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  States and they fully know that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  My concern is what is the United States saying? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=192.44s)]
*  I mean I think supporting Israel in the campaign, the president started out that correctly. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=195.24s)]
*  Getting into the details of how they execute their campaign, that I think belongs to Israel [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=201.44000000000003s)]
*  and their leaders. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  And the kind of counsel we should give them is something they already know. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=208.28s)]
*  Conduct military operations and certainly protect as many civilians as you possibly [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=212.36s)]
*  can in the execution of that operation. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=216.72000000000003s)]
*  And then let Israel execute those details of that plan. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=219.28s)]
*  We don't need to get into micromanaging them as I think we likely really are when we're [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  making public statements and telling the American people the advice we're giving to the Israelis. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=228.11999999999998s)]
*  I don't think we should have those kind of public disclosures. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  Let the Israelis run the campaign. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=237.56s)]
*  They certainly are very much aware of the civilian, the potential for civilian casualties [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=239.56s)]
*  in the south. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=245.2s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=246.39999999999998s)]
*  General Jack Keen, always educational. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=249.04s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=250.04s)]
*  You guys have a great weekend. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=251.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdVzL4n2xtg&t=253.20000000000002s)]
