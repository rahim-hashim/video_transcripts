# Dem Sen. Fetterman says media weaponized his mental health
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw)
*  Well, Senator Federman is very upset, because he says that, now that he's kind of recovered [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=0.0s)]
*  from his stroke, that the Democrats are now upset that he has come out to the middle on [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=7.76s)]
*  a lot of issues, and they're trying to go back to the health issues he had, and that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=16.68s)]
*  they're weaponizing that against him, really not upset about his health. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=22.84s)]
*  What they're upset about is that he now has more nuanced and maybe in the middle positions. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=26.88s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=33.08s)]
*  He said, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=34.08s)]
*  Fair enough, Shannon. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=52.0s)]
*  You think he's right? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  This has been a really tricky story here in Washington, because it's his former chief [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=56.24s)]
*  of staff reached out to his physician to say, I'm worried about him. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=60.0s)]
*  This is somebody who worked with him, who cared about him, who says, yes, we celebrate [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=63.56s)]
*  that he got help for that and that he was transparent about it, but I'm worried that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=68.52000000000001s)]
*  he's not following through with the plan. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=72.08s)]
*  The Hill reports that there are a number of Senate Democrats who are worried about him, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=74.36s)]
*  who want to find out the best way to try to intercede or help him, that they have real [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  concerns. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=82.68s)]
*  He has been showing up, stepping up his schedule in the Senate, doing hearings and other events. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=83.72000000000001s)]
*  He says, yeah, this is just being weaponized against me, the fact that I received mental [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=88.12s)]
*  health care and treatment. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  I don't know exactly where this is going to wind up, but I am having a conversation with [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  Senator Fetterman, Senator McCormick next week. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=99.72s)]
*  We've got a special conversation that we're going to have and sit down with them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=103.0s)]
*  It's certain to come up and to see how he's doing and whether he thinks this is just a [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  political hijab or whether people are genuinely concerned. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=111.64s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=114.12s)]
*  Well, that'll be a must watch interview and we will be tuning in. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=115.64s)]
*  I'm sure you'll get to the bottom of that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=119.84s)]
*  So thank you, Shannon, and watch Fox News Sunday today on Fox News Channel. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=122.28s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=127.04s)]
*  Thanks, Shannon. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=128.04s)]
*  We want her to get to the bottom of the Belichick scandal as well. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPWB3tbyJw&t=129.04s)]
