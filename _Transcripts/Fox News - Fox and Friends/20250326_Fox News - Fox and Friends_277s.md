# Judges move to block Trump agenda at historic pace, House vows action
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8)
*  It violates separation of powers when a judge thinks that they can enjoin something that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=0.0s)]
*  a president is doing that the American people voted for. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  That is not what the founders intended. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=7.44s)]
*  We do have authority over the federal courts, as you know. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=8.88s)]
*  We can eliminate an entire district court. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  We have power funding over the courts and all these other things. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=13.8s)]
*  But desperate times call for desperate measures and Congress is going to act. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=17.48s)]
*  Now Speaker Johnson sounded an alarm about judges blocking the president's agenda as [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=20.6s)]
*  he makes it clear Congress has the power to stop them. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=25.36s)]
*  House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan joins us now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  Good morning Chairman. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=31.36s)]
*  Good morning Lawrence. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=32.36s)]
*  So let's look at some of these injunctions by the court. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=33.36s)]
*  I think it tells a story. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=36.0s)]
*  When you look at Trump's first term, we're talking about 64 injunctions. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=37.96s)]
*  Now you compare that to Bush's entire term, you've got six, Obama with 12 and Biden with [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  14. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=48.72s)]
*  Already right now Trump is at 15 for the second term. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=49.72s)]
*  So what's going to be done? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=54.0s)]
*  There's legislative approaches to this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=56.8s)]
*  We passed legislation out of the committee two and a half weeks ago which said when some [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=58.52s)]
*  judge in Timbuktu, California issues an injunction, it should only apply to the parties in the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=61.88s)]
*  case in that respective jurisdiction. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=67.72s)]
*  It shouldn't have nationwide implications. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=69.6s)]
*  So the Speaker's indicated that legislation will be on the floor next week. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=71.74s)]
*  So we have legislative ways to address this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=74.84s)]
*  We have the appropriations process that the Speaker also mentioned. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  We control the power of the purse and we may want to look at the money that goes to the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=80.32s)]
*  courts and judges. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=83.8s)]
*  We don't want to jeopardize justice for the American people and we certainly don't want [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=84.92s)]
*  to jeopardize any security concerns that justices have. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=88.16s)]
*  We all remember what took place after the Dobbs leak with Justice Kavanaugh. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  But there may be some areas we can look at there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=97.16s)]
*  And then finally the third lever we have as the legislative branch is oversight. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=99.08s)]
*  And we plan to have hearings starting next Tuesday on this broad subject where we look [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=103.84s)]
*  at some of these what I would simply call ridiculous orders. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=108.64s)]
*  I mean Judge Boasberg, he basically said, well he didn't basically, he did say turn [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=112.72s)]
*  the plane around, bring bad guys who were here illegally who did terrible things, turn [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=117.2s)]
*  the plane around and bring the bad guys back to the country. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=122.96s)]
*  That makes no sense when you think about the commander in chief and his constitutional [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  authority, the authority he has under the statute, the Alien Enemies Act made no sense. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=130.84s)]
*  So we're going to look at that as well. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=135.84s)]
*  But Mr. Chairman, why can't we get some type of bill to bring this to the Supreme Court [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=137.72s)]
*  when there's a challenge against the president? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=144.72s)]
*  Because we've taken all this time and the American people want action because that's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=148.48s)]
*  what they voted for. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=153.56s)]
*  In the legislation sponsored by Representative Issa that we passed on the injunction issue, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=155.36s)]
*  we also have some expedited review in there if you got some of the state attorney generals [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=160.36s)]
*  being there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=164.92s)]
*  So we're also looking at the broader approach. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=165.92s)]
*  Is there an expedited review process so the appellate courts can get these issues done [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=167.88s)]
*  in a faster manner and get it to the Supreme Court in a much quicker fashion? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=173.16s)]
*  So yeah, we're looking at that issue as well on the legislative front. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=177.04s)]
*  Let's talk about the review when it comes to this judge who wanted to block the flights. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  The president has declared the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  These people aren't citizens, right? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  So based on that act, he has the authority to skip some due process there. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=192.08s)]
*  What's going to happen in a case like that? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=197.24s)]
*  Or even with Marco Rubio, when you've got a guy that's coordinated with Hamas, he's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  on a green card, he lied on his forms, shouldn't the executive branch have some discretion [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=203.08s)]
*  here? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=209.28s)]
*  Yeah, the commander in chief, and after all he campaigned on this, the American people [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=210.28s)]
*  elected him to do this, Article 2, Section 1, first sentence, executive power shall be [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=213.96s)]
*  vested in the president of the United States. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=218.28s)]
*  A strong constitutional ground, strong statutory ground, and you're right, these guys are here [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=221.44s)]
*  illegally and they're not boy scouts, they're really bad guys. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=225.72s)]
*  This judge says, no, no, no, bring them back here, I've got to check it out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=230.32000000000002s)]
*  By the way, this is the same judge. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  This judge is the one who was there eight years ago with the whole FISA Court Trump-Russia [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=236.0s)]
*  baloney. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  This is the judge that allowed the crazy dossier to be used as a basis for going to spy on [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  a presidential campaign, President Trump's campaign. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=247.08s)]
*  So there's the history there, it starts to look like this judge is operating in a political [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=249.92s)]
*  fashion, and we want to look at that as well in our hearings that we plan to start again [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=254.96s)]
*  next Tuesday. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=260.0s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for giving us some time this morning. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=261.0s)]
*  You bet, thank you, Lawrence. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx5imGIm8f8&t=264.52s)]
