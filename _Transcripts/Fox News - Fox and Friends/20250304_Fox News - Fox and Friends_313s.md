# Melania Trump calls out Dems for skipping her nonpartisan event
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4)
*  There are going to be guests as well that advance the agenda of the Republicans and the Democrats. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  For instance, Melania tonight, the First Lady, is going to have somebody who is impacted by a deep fake, an inappropriate image. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=6.4s)]
*  Her name, Ellison Barry, she's been on this program. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=15.4s)]
*  Yesterday, Melania was talking in Washington about the Take It Down Act, and she threw her support behind it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=18.8s)]
*  Essentially, it's a bipartisan bill, and what it does is if somebody posts something inappropriate, and it couldn't be a deep fake, not even real, AI, about you, and you are embarrassed, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=27.0s)]
*  you contact that social media company or that tech company, and they've got to take it down fast or they're going to be in trouble. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=39.2s)]
*  Anybody who puts that crap up there could wind up with a big penalty or even jail time. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=46.2s)]
*  It's interesting, Ainsley, that you even need legislation to get something like this done, right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=52.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, I think the only reason is because this is a new thing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=56.8s)]
*  You know, the Internet age has not been around all that long, and so they're realizing that these children's lives are being ruined. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=60.8s)]
*  Here's Melania. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=66.0s)]
*  I'm here with you today with a common goal, to protect our youth from online harm. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=69.2s)]
*  The widespread presence of abusive behavior in the digital domain affects the daily lives of our children, families, and communities. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=77.2s)]
*  Addressing this issue is essential for fostering a safe and supportive environment for our young people. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=89.4s)]
*  I must admit, however, I expected to see more Democrats, leaders with us here today, to address this serious issue. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=97.4s)]
*  Surely as adults, we can prioritize Americans' children ahead of partisan politics. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=108.0s)]
*  Brian? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=116.2s)]
*  Yeah, it was good to see her out. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=117.2s)]
*  This is the first time we've seen her, really, since she was officially been our First Lady at the inauguration. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  I think it's a great cause to get behind. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=123.2s)]
*  She's clearly motivated by it, and is there any flip side to it? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=124.9s)]
*  You would think this would be an opportunity for Keem Jeffries and company to show up, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=129.70000000000002s)]
*  unless you're pro-harassing students and ruin their lives, and a lot eventually turns into suicide. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=134.70000000000002s)]
*  Here's Ellison Berry, a Texas high school student and a deep fake victim, talking about what this means. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=142.1s)]
*  This was back in December of 2024 on Fox and Friends. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=148.3s)]
*  I was a victim of AI crimes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=153.1s)]
*  So last October, I experienced my AI deepfakes going around my entire school. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=155.1s)]
*  A classmate took an innocent photo off my Instagram and put it through an AI editing tool that stripped my clothing off and sent it around my entire school. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=161.1s)]
*  We are urging the House to pass this bill in order to protect so many people. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=171.1s)]
*  I mean, the future generations at risk. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=175.9s)]
*  This is what we are aiming at, and there are so many people and so many victims that don't have the ability to go and tell their story. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=177.9s)]
*  So Ellison was so excited about entering high school, as we all were. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=184.9s)]
*  Remember that? You leave in eighth grade, you're going to a new big school. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=188.9s)]
*  She was 14 years old. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=190.9s)]
*  Right at the beginning of school, she was in a picture with nine girls, and whoever did this, someone at her school, they stripped down all of them, so they were all naked. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=192.9s)]
*  The picture starts being distributed around their new high school, where they're going. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=201.9s)]
*  All the older guys are seeing this probably. It's being passed around. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=205.9s)]
*  She's extremely embarrassed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=208.9s)]
*  She goes on Snapchat. She tries to get it taken down. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=210.9s)]
*  She couldn't get it taken down. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=213.9s)]
*  She runs into her mom's room crying right after this had happened. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=214.9s)]
*  Her picture stayed up there for eight and a half months. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=218.9s)]
*  Do you know how she got it down? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=221.9s)]
*  She called Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=223.9s)]
*  He said, what? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=225.9s)]
*  He calls Snapchat. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=226.9s)]
*  He says, put me on with the CEO. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=227.9s)]
*  The picture was taken down immediately. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=229.9s)]
*  But he said, because she contacted her senator. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=231.9s)]
*  But if you're Taylor Swift, he said it's easy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=234.9s)]
*  You have connections. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=237.9s)]
*  You can get these pictures taken down quickly. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=238.9s)]
*  But if you're just a normal teenage girl, and this happens to you, it takes months and months and months. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=240.9s)]
*  And he says, no longer. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=246.9s)]
*  Because Ted Cruz was there yesterday. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=247.9s)]
*  Ted Cruz was the co-host for the event. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=249.9s)]
*  And it passed unanimously in the Senate a while back. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=252.9s)]
*  And now it is sitting on Mike Johnson's desk. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=256.9s)]
*  The Republicans say they're going to try to take it up in the next couple of weeks. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=259.9s)]
*  They should, immediately. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=262.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=263.9s)]
*  What about today? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=264.9s)]
*  You know, tons of people are saving those images on their phones. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=265.9s)]
*  This could come back to bite her when she's applying for a job or when she's a mom and her children ask her, what is this? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=269.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=276.9s)]
*  And the last thing I would say, I'm not optimistic Democrats will support this because they're not even supporting that trans sports bill. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=277.9s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=284.9s)]
*  Where 75% of the country are not for trans men playing women's sports. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=285.9s)]
*  They only got 51 votes yesterday in the Senate. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=289.9s)]
*  So here's another bill that they should be able to rally behind. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=292.9s)]
*  But they didn't show up. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=295.9s)]
*  Why they wouldn't just sign off on this and start rebuilding their image, I don't know. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=296.9s)]
*  But that's up to them to answer. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gnroyfZQ4&t=300.9s)]
