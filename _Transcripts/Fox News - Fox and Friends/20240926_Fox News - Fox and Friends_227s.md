# Melania Trump looks back on assassination attempt on husband, Mar-a-Lago raid
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI)
*  All right, tomorrow morning, I'm Fox and Friends. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=0.0s)]
*  Starting at 6 a.m. through 9 a.m., Ainsley Erhart will air her exclusive interview with [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=3.72s)]
*  Melania Trump. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=9.32s)]
*  Now, she was interviewing the former first lady about her brand-new book, and it's called [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=10.32s)]
*  Melania. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=14.92s)]
*  And during their discussion, Ainsley asked her about the assassination attempts on the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=16.14s)]
*  life of her husband. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=20.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=21.52s)]
*  So, the assassination attempts, the first one is in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=22.52s)]
*  And you write about watching the assassination attempt on TV, and you started working, and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=27.04s)]
*  you were distracted, so you pushed pause. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=33.2s)]
*  So, you didn't see that first assassination attempt, and someone called you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=35.16s)]
*  I think your chief of staff maybe called you and said, he's okay, but there's been a shooting. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=38.76s)]
*  What happened next? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=44.64s)]
*  I ran to the TV, and I rewind it, and I watched it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  I was only a few minutes behind. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=54.64s)]
*  And something, I guess, looked over me, so I didn't really see live-live, but maybe, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=57.64s)]
*  you know, three minutes, few minutes later. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=67.44s)]
*  But when I saw it, I, you know, it was only, nobody really knew yet. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=69.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=75.8s)]
*  Because when you see him on the floor, and you don't know, you don't know what really [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=76.8s)]
*  happened. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=83.92s)]
*  And then a few weeks later, there's another attempt on your husband's life at your golf [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=85.28s)]
*  course. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=89.48s)]
*  Where were you, and what was your reaction to this attempt? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=90.68s)]
*  I was in New York City, actually, and I saw it on the television. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  And as soon as I saw it on television, I called again. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=102.2s)]
*  And he was okay, because Secret Service were great. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=107.92s)]
*  The guys that they were with him, they were fantastic. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=113.44s)]
*  And I think both of the events, they were really a miracle. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=116.64s)]
*  If you really think about it, July 13 was a miracle, like that much, and he could, you [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=124.52s)]
*  know, he could not be with us. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=132.32s)]
*  Now, they also discussed the FBI's unprecedented raid at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=134.84s)]
*  By the way, they didn't raid Hillary's place, and she had top secret classified information [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=140.44s)]
*  on her servers or Joe Biden's four locations with top secret classified information. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  But she spoke about the raid at Mar-a-Lago in 2022. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=150.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=153.68s)]
*  The raid on Mar-a-Lago, the house manager texts you and says the FBI is outside the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=155.16000000000003s)]
*  house. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  They had access to my bedroom, closets, office, and rummaged through my personal items. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=161.28s)]
*  You even searched Barron's room, you say. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=167.92s)]
*  So how invasive was that? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=170.48s)]
*  Did it make you angry? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=172.28s)]
*  How did you feel? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=173.48s)]
*  Yeah, it made me angry. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=174.48s)]
*  Yes, invasion of privacy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=176.24s)]
*  And the way it was done was, I was really surprised. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=179.64s)]
*  You wanted to see it for your own eyes, with your own eyes. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=186.28s)]
*  What did it look like when you walked back in your house that had been raided? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=190.16s)]
*  I saw unpleasant stuff that nobody wants to see it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=195.04s)]
*  And you get angry because, you know, nobody should be putting up with that kind of stuff. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=200.0s)]
*  Some person, I don't even know who or how many people, they, you know, they went through [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  my stuff. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8Ws6gIjUI&t=214.28s)]
