*  golf course and Sean Hannity joins us now Sean it happened at 1 30 yesterday [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=14.08s)]

*  tell us that story. It was a really actually guys it was not long right [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=24.24s)]
*  after the incident happened the president was playing with a dear friend [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=30.36s)]
*  of mine Steve Woodkoff and I had gone to breakfast with Steve and another guy [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=34.56s)]
*  another friend of ours and we had breakfast together the whole breakfast [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=40.32s)]
*  Steve was giving me a hard time come play golf with us come play golf with us [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=44.08s)]
*  and Steve is near a scratch golfer the president pretty much is a scratch [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=47.44s)]
*  golfer and I'm like I don't have time to play so I'm not that good with you good [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=51.72s)]
*  at golf right now but I hope I hope to get back to what I used to play and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=56.04s)]
*  anyway so he goes off and plays my phone rings maybe before too right after the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=61.08s)]
*  incident happened when he was immediately back in the clubhouse and he [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=67.76s)]
*  told me what had happened and he said that four shots had gone off they heard [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=71.84s)]
*  it was pop pop pop pop that's how he described it and he was absolutely [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=76.76s)]
*  positively blown away by how quickly the Secret Service got on the president got [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=83.08s)]
*  him off the golf course how quickly tripods were set up by by by [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=91.88s)]
*  sharpshooters within the Secret Service and how professional they were he will [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=97.16s)]
*  tell his entire story tonight on on Hannity there are a couple of things I [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=103.2s)]
*  was listening to to Brian's interview with the sheriff that law enforcement in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  Florida is so much better than it is in New York they don't buy into this woke [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=112.36s)]
*  defund dismantled no bail law idiocy and insanity they take law and order very [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=117.68s)]
*  seriously down here and I praise the sheriff and I praise everybody in in the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=123.88s)]
*  But there there is something we have to examine very closely here after a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=129.82s)]
*  conversation I had with Governor DeSantis last night it really struck me [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=136.34s)]
*  I said governor you've played that golf course tell me a little bit more about [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=139.9s)]
*  it and he was describing how there are two holes a par-3 and a par-4 the par-4 [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=143.82s)]
*  is a drivable par-4 and what he described to me it was the area closest [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=150.6s)]
*  to where this fence is that we keep hearing about that is surrounded in this [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=156.06s)]
*  treeed area and what is really disconcerting to me if you go back to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=161.54s)]
*  Butler remember we were told by the Secret Service who the people who are [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=167.32s)]
*  making the decisions what the perimeter around the president ought to be not the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=171.3s)]
*  guys that are willing to dive on the president put their life in harm's way [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  and die to protect him but the people that are are responsible for making [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=182.1s)]
*  sure that perimeter is closed there are some real serious questions more than we [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=189.06s)]
*  had yesterday this morning because they got within 130 yards in Butler and they [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=194.4s)]
*  claimed it was a sloped roof that turned out not to be a sloped roof at all and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=200.42s)]
*  that's very troublesome that we weren't told the truth then and we still haven't [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=204.18s)]
*  bottom of it we know that Connecticut senator Blumenthal said Americans will [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=208.54s)]
*  be shocked they will be appalled when they learn about the failures in Butler [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  but now we have a situation where we have we have a street about 300 yards [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=217.74s)]
*  from where the president was and what's very disconcerting to me is how is it [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=225.29999999999998s)]
*  possible that nobody was watching that street and the way Governor DeSantis [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=232.82s)]
*  described this to me was if you ever see a picture of Donald Trump playing golf [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=238.9s)]
*  it's it's a photographer in that treat area by the fence that we keep hearing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=243.5s)]
*  at about that there that's the area where they're gonna get the picture right [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=249.5s)]
*  they're not gonna get it anywhere else on the golf course well that would also [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=253.74s)]
*  be the area that if you are a shooter that you have the closest proximity to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=257.26s)]
*  now a top presidential candidate former president and that kind of bothered me [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=263.94s)]
*  during the press conference yesterday when they said well there would have [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=269.65999999999997s)]
*  been more protection if he was the president there was a recent [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=272.5s)]
*  assassination attempt just 60 some odd days ago he's a top presidential [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=275.65999999999997s)]
*  contender we're 51 days away from a from a presidential election and you're [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=279.98s)]
*  allowing somebody with an AK 47 that has a scope on it to be literally within 300 [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  yards which would be the equivalent if you want a golf analogy of a one-foot [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=292.74s)]
*  putt or a tap-in pot so there is a major failure here if they're not covering [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=297.62s)]
*  that street and making sure nobody gets in the bushes let alone with an AK 47 and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=303.18s)]
*  two backpacks and a GoPro and and everything else we know that this guy [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=309.42s)]
*  had I will tell you this I think as close as Butler was we were this is this [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=313.62s)]
*  is so eerie they got this guy got very close to killing the president if it [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=323.26s)]
*  weren't for one Secret Service agent you know spotting the the the rifle and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=329.54s)]
*  taking the shot this guy gets a shot off this is a very different story tell us [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=335.94s)]
*  the story I heard you share it on radio about the town hall how your last town [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=341.54s)]
*  hall with Donald Trump was different well you know I thought at some point [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=344.82s)]
*  somebody might remember I said that story I was probably not going to talk [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=349.74s)]
*  about it again I if LJ was here today I was gonna say to LJ LJ I've been doing [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=352.98s)]
*  town halls since before you were born we all love LJ and I've done all these [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=359.06s)]
*  town halls all around the country I've done many with President Trump in [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=364.94s)]
*  particular I've had events with George W Bush other other presidents and other [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=368.1s)]
*  presidential candidates I think I interviewed all 17 Republican candidates [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=372.58000000000004s)]
*  but back when they were running in 2015 and 16 and so I've had all these town [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=380.06s)]
*  halls when I did the recent one in Harrisburg I'd never faced a situation [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=385.02000000000004s)]
*  like I did here where the Secret Service was adamant nobody in the audience could [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=390.14000000000004s)]
*  be on the floor surrounding the stage that had never been the case in any [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=395.98s)]
*  previous town hall then we were told yeah we're not gonna allow you to fill [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=399.74s)]
*  in fill up the entire building and there was a little back and forth with with [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=404.78s)]
*  the campaign and we were asking why because that had never happened before [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=410.3s)]
*  and then one other very strange thing happened that I had never experienced [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=414.74s)]
*  which was the Secret Service whoever was in charge of the detail that day very [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=419.14s)]
*  nicely great guy I love these guys I admire these guys they're they're [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=423.42s)]
*  willing to risk their lives for people he asked for a few minutes of my time to [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=427.26s)]
*  pull me aside pull me to an area where we were both looking at the stage that I [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=431.66s)]
*  was going to be on doing the town hall where I would be sitting where President [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=436.70000000000005s)]
*  Trump would be sitting and then pointed out on the stage I don't want to go into [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=441.06s)]
*  too many details pointed out in the area two separate locations I could go if [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=447.1s)]
*  shots were fired at that event in all the town halls I had done over all these [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=452.42s)]
*  many years that had never happened before nor had we had audience [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=457.54s)]
*  limitations like we had there so that that was that was pretty odd which [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=461.18s)]
*  tells me if I was gonna make a conclusion there are actionable threats [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=466.02000000000004s)]
*  that that probably this is what director Ray is talking about every time he goes [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=469.94s)]
*  before Congress indeed and folks tune in to Sean show tonight 9 p.m. Eastern Time [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=474.62s)]
*  where he talked with the former president about what went down yesterday [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=479.82s)]
*  yeah thanks so much I'm Steve Ducey I'm Brian Kilmeade and I'm Ainsley Earhart [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkqpTRnsoA&t=483.3s)]
