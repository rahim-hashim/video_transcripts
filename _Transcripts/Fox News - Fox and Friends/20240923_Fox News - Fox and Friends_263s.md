# Hezbollah vows 'war of reckoning' following Israel's attacks on Lebanon
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg)
*  All right, a Fox News alert IDF forces have hit about 300 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon today as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=0.0s)]
*  Hezbollah is war vowing a war of reckoning the IDF confirming [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  It is taking down six senior Hezbollah commanders including at least one on the State Department's most wanted list [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  But the United States still warning caution [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=19.8s)]
*  Nobody including Secretary Austin is shedding a tear over the death of Mr. Accio who does have American blood on his hands [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=23.76s)]
*  I think the world's better for not having him walking around on the planet anymore [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=30.76s)]
*  But that doesn't mean we want to see a full out war [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  We don't believe again that that's in the best interest of the Israeli people [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  All right here for with reaction is retired Navy SEAL and author Jack Carr. Jack, good morning to you [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Hey, thanks so much for having me [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  All right, we knew this was coming eventually [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  I mean Hezbollah kept shooting rockets into Israel [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  They're not gonna just sit there and say oh stop it. They're gonna do something. Nope, and they have they've been provoked long enough [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=52.76s)]
*  But really the seeds of what happened today was happening over the last year [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=58.76s)]
*  We're planted back in the early 80s with the group [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=61.76s)]
*  We now know as Hezbollah hitting us first at our embassy in April of 1983 and then at the Marine Barrett [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  Barracks and headquarters bombing that happened on October 23rd 1983 and interestingly enough just this last Friday [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  We finally got one of the people who was involved in both of those attacks and an embassy annex bombing which happened 40 years ago [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=77.76s)]
*  To the date this last Friday, so he's been taken off the board [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=84.76s)]
*  40 years. Yeah. Well the United States never forgets when it comes to the bad guys [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=89.76s)]
*  Here's the thing that's going on now though [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=95.76s)]
*  Hezbollah [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=98.76s)]
*  Last week the beepers and the the walkie-talkies started blowing up. We knew there would be a reaction [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=99.76s)]
*  However, it [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=105.76s)]
*  Israel has completely overwhelmed them. They haven't really been able to get off a good shot [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=107.76s)]
*  No, it's absolutely [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=112.76s)]
*  It's incredible what they pulled off especially with the first the pagers and then with the walkie-talkies the next day [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=113.76s)]
*  It's a modern-day Trojan horse [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=118.76s)]
*  This will be studied for decades if not centuries and obviously they use pagers [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=120.76s)]
*  Because there are less listening devices on those than say on our cell phones right there cameras photos text messages emails [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=123.76s)]
*  Those don't exist on the pagers [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=130.76s)]
*  But what Israel did to get inside that supply chain or perhaps to create the company years and years ago [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=132.76s)]
*  But then feeds these pagers into the system and to precision to so precisely target Hezbollah leadership through these pagers that is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=138.76s)]
*  Unprecedented and will be studied for decades. No kidding [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=145.76s)]
*  It was absolutely brilliant that it worked and they pulled it off before the those guys were able to figure it out in Lebanon [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=148.76s)]
*  Let me ask you this for the people sitting Jack here in the United States worried about a larger war [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=155.76s)]
*  Is that one of your concerns? Oh, it certainly is a concern [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=160.76s)]
*  And right now that's really the balls in Iran's court [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=164.76s)]
*  Not necessarily Hezbollah not necessarily Hamas [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=167.76s)]
*  But Iran and what they learned from the 1983 Bayer Barak's bombing is that terrorism works and unfortunately [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=169.76s)]
*  We didn't retaliate in the wake of that event. We left in early 1984 [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=175.76s)]
*  So that's not a random lesson right and that terrorism works through these proxies [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=179.76s)]
*  So they set the rules and right now Israel shifting those rules a bit [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=183.76s)]
*  So maximum pressure on Iran while supporting the Iranian populace [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=187.76s)]
*  So we'll see well the United Nations General Assembly convenes this week [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=191.76s)]
*  And it turns out there's a Reuters story out this morning that it sounds like Iran is now willing to talk about nuclear stuff [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=195.76s)]
*  But isn't that just so coincidental all this stuff is going where they are helping Hezbollah fire off at Israel [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=203.76s)]
*  Now they're going oh, you know what? We want peace. Oh certainly and there's a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=210.76s)]
*  This maximum pressure also includes other countries in the region as well [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=215.76s)]
*  Israeli Special Operations Forces about two weeks ago did a very audacious mission into Syria hitting a precision guided weapons facility [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=219.76s)]
*  Also a Russian listening post there's a Russian component to a relationship with Syria [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=227.76s)]
*  They put Israeli Special Operations Forces on the ground went inside this facility blew it up from the inside because they couldn't hit it from the air [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=231.76s)]
*  And use drones as a blocking force for the first time so Israel is on the move [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=238.76s)]
*  You've been thinking about this for a long time. He's written a great book. It's called targeted Beirut Jack Carr [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbqht5OvCxg&t=243.76s)]
