# NEW: Mexico refuses Trump's offer for Army to help crack down on cartels
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo)
*  All right, meantime, we have this for you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=0.0s)]
*  Mexican President Claudia Scheinbaum says she has declined President Trump's offer to [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=2.12s)]
*  send U.S. troops to Mexico to help crack down on the fentanyl crisis. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=6.92s)]
*  Madeline Rivera is live in Washington with the details. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=11.6s)]
*  Maddie? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=15.4s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=16.4s)]
*  The president has described productive conversations with Mexican President Claudia Scheinbaum, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  but it appears Scheinbaum is drawing a line on the cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=22.36s)]
*  Last month, during a phone conversation with Scheinbaum, President Trump suggested U.S. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=27.84s)]
*  armed forces take a role in battling Mexican drug gangs. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=32.2s)]
*  Here's Scheinbaum's response. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=35.72s)]
*  He said, how can we help you fight drug trafficking? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  I propose that the United States Army enter to help you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=42.08s)]
*  And you know what I told him? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  No, President Trump. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=46.8s)]
*  The territory is inviolable. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=48.22s)]
*  Sovereignty is inviolable. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=50.68s)]
*  Sovereignty is not for sale. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  We can collaborate. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=54.32s)]
*  We can work together. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=55.32s)]
*  But you on your territory. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=56.32s)]
*  We on ours. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=58.16s)]
*  Meantime, Trump administration officials are taking aim at The New York Times for their [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=60.16s)]
*  headline about a man who was arrested and charged with violating a corpse on a New York [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=64.76s)]
*  City subway last month. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=69.64s)]
*  ICE sources tell Fox the man was in the country illegally, crossing the border several times [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=71.72s)]
*  since the 1990s. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=76.56s)]
*  There's no mention, though, of the man's immigration status on the headline. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=78.44s)]
*  The administration has riled up about that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=82.08s)]
*  The H.S. now out with this post making their edits to the headline, crossing out the word [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=84.84s)]
*  man, and putting in illegal alien instead. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=89.0s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitz saying, wow, update your story, New York Times. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=92.12s)]
*  It's worth noting that when the article was published, the man's legal status was not [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=97.64s)]
*  known. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=101.36s)]
*  But it looks like the article has not been updated since April 28th. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=102.36s)]
*  Joey Rachel and Kevin. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=106.2s)]
*  Thank you so much, Maddie. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=107.2s)]
*  You got it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXgkQF1iAo&t=108.2s)]
