# New film gives a glimpse into the life of first millennial saint
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU)
*  Well, a new documentary is hitting theaters today, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=0.0s)]
*  and it follows a group of teens as they learn [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=3.12s)]
*  about the remarkable life of the first millennial saint, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=5.64s)]
*  Carlo Acutis. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=9.48s)]
*  Not really expecting to get a lot out of it [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=12.68s)]
*  from the religious point of it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=15.84s)]
*  I wanna have a good time, have Italian food. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=17.92s)]
*  I always questioned, is God real? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=19.96s)]
*  The attraction of Carlo Acutis is that he's a young [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=22.44s)]
*  millennial saint who was technologically savvy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=25.52s)]
*  His goal is to get people off of his website [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=29.12s)]
*  back into church. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=32.2s)]
*  Jim Wahlberg worked on the film, Carlo Acutis, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=34.9s)]
*  the Roadmap to Reality, and he joins us now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=38.04s)]
*  Jim, it's so great to have you on. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=41.02s)]
*  For those who don't know about this young man who died, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=42.96s)]
*  I believe in 2006, he's about to be canonized as saint. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=46.0s)]
*  His, by the way, his canonization was postponed [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  because of the Pope's funeral. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=51.72s)]
*  But tell us who he is and why he's going to be [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  up for canonization. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=58.96s)]
*  Why will he be a saint? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so it's interesting. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=62.52s)]
*  First of all, thank you so much for having me. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=64.72s)]
*  This young man fell in love with Jesus and the Eucharist [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  at a very young age, even younger than before he made [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=73.92s)]
*  his first Holy Communion. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=77.16s)]
*  In fact, he asked if he could make his first [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  Holy Communion early because he was so desirous [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=80.4s)]
*  of being one with the body of Christ. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=84.32s)]
*  You know, he came from a family that was not very religious [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  and in fact ended up bringing his own family [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=90.7s)]
*  back to the faith. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=94.64s)]
*  So this young man did some very simple things [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=96.0s)]
*  and it's an indication that any one of us could be a saint. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  He evangelized people. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  He built a website and collected information [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  on Eucharistic miracles. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  So it was the first time all of those miracles [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=111.84s)]
*  could be found in one place. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=114.22s)]
*  All with the hope of leading people to the church. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=116.8s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's such a remarkable story, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=119.72s)]
*  especially the fact that he didn't even, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=122.08s)]
*  he came from a Catholic family, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=123.64s)]
*  but not necessarily a religious family, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=124.83999999999999s)]
*  that how he came, how the Holy Spirit spoke to him [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=126.17999999999999s)]
*  and as a child and put him on this path. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=129.44s)]
*  But I think the message of the church, as you said, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=133.04s)]
*  so beautifully is that, and the reason why the church [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=135.56s)]
*  does this, makes people saints and puts them forward [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  for us as examples is really, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=142.92s)]
*  we're called to be saints, right? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=144.88s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a reminder. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=146.96s)]
*  It really, this young man is a reminder of just that, right? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=149.0s)]
*  When we look throughout history in the church, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=152.92s)]
*  we see many saints that were martyred, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=155.48s)]
*  that had their heads cut off [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=157.72s)]
*  because they refused to denounce Jesus, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=159.96s)]
*  And so sometimes we think we need to do [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=163.0s)]
*  all of these amazing things [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=165.66s)]
*  in order to ever be considered a saint [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=167.4s)]
*  and it's too far out of reach. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=169.4s)]
*  But what this young man did was just the simple things [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=171.6s)]
*  that were all expected to do. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=174.04s)]
*  And as a result, he is a saint. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=176.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's so beautiful. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=179.28s)]
*  All of my children know about Carlo Acutis. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=180.84s)]
*  He really does speak to young, my teenagers especially. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  They are just really drawn to him in so many ways. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  He's so relatable. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=189.92s)]
*  He played soccer, as you said, he built a website. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  What a beautiful story for you to take your own talents [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=193.44s)]
*  and put it towards telling this story [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=197.24s)]
*  and bringing more people to Jesus. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=199.72s)]
*  So thank you so much, Jim. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=201.2s)]
*  We're gonna make sure that we put up here [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  that this movie called Carlo Acutis Roadmap to Reality [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=206.04s)]
*  is available in theaters April 27th through April 29th. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=210.11999999999998s)]
*  Last word, Jim. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=215.89999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we're on over a thousand screens today. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=217.72s)]
*  And if you want to be able to continue [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=220.79999999999998s)]

*  because the theaters don't want us. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  They want Batman, they want blockbusters. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhUrEr4JCU&t=228.96s)]
