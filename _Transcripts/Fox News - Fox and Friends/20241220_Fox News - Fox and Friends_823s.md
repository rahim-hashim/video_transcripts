# Elon or Vivek should take over as House speaker, says senator
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY)
*  Utah Senator Mike Lee joins me now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=0.0s)]
*  So you have an idea we're hearing. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=2.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=3.5s)]
*  I've got an idea. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=4.84s)]
*  Look, Jesse, it wasn't Congress that did this. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=6.04s)]
*  It was four people, four guys. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=8.58s)]
*  I caught the law firm of Schumer, McConnell, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=10.34s)]
*  Johnson, and Jeffries. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=12.08s)]
*  This whole debacle was avoidable, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=13.84s)]
*  it was preventable, foreseeable. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=16.68s)]
*  In fact, it was foreseen and warned of. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=18.72s)]
*  But these guys are falling into the same rut [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=21.18s)]
*  that they've been in for a long time, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=23.42s)]
*  which is the firm, as I call it, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=25.52s)]
*  negotiates a spending bill in secret, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=28.02s)]
*  releases it just hours or days before we're supposed to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=30.48s)]
*  leave for the Christmas holidays, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=33.72s)]
*  and inevitably it's full of garbage. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=35.36s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=37.62s)]
*  Wait, so you're saying, hold on, just back up. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=38.72s)]
*  So you're saying these four people, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=40.66s)]
*  you're saying Jeffries, Johnson, McConnell, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=42.56s)]
*  the firm. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=46.099999999999994s)]
*  They did this. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=46.94s)]
*  Okay, McConnell and Schumer, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  they cooked this up for the last 85 days in secret, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=50.0s)]
*  dropped it on everybody Wednesday, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=54.0s)]
*  and this is where we are. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=56.699999999999996s)]
*  Yes, and it has failed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  It's failed miserably because the American people [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=60.28s)]
*  are awake, they have access to X, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=62.14s)]
*  they have access to Water's World, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=63.98s)]
*  they have access to information and to apps [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=66.14s)]
*  that will help them quickly digest this information. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=68.42s)]
*  This does not work. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=70.92s)]
*  It's an historic moment, it's falling apart. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=72.42s)]
*  And as a result, somebody's gonna have to lose [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=74.96s)]
*  their job over this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=77.5s)]
*  I don't think the speaker is going to remain in power. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=78.82s)]
*  That's my prediction, I'm not in the house. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=81.25999999999999s)]
*  If I'm correct in that, and I think I am, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=83.3s)]
*  we need bold new leadership, outside leadership, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=86.86s)]
*  and I think it needs to be a Doge speaker. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=89.02s)]
*  It needs to be either Vivek Ramaswamy [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=91.52s)]
*  or it needs to be Elon Musk. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  Look, I was over here a couple weeks ago, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  House and Senate Republicans for a Doge caucus meeting. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  I've never seen, we're like herding cats, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=100.64s)]
*  Republicans on Capitol Hill, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=103.24s)]
*  never seen so much attention, so much respect [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=104.89999999999999s)]
*  for two people in our entire caucus, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=108.63999999999999s)]
*  in the Senate and in the House. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=111.94s)]
*  So you're officially nominating [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  right here on Jesse Water's Prime Time, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=115.1s)]
*  either Vivek or Elon to be House Speaker. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=117.1s)]
*  Doesn't have to be a politician, could be anyone, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=119.84s)]
*  can be Speaker. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  Do they want that job? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  Look, I'm a little bit skeptical. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=126.38s)]
*  Elon is kind of busy. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  He's got like 54 companies that he's running [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=130.06s)]
*  and trying to get to the moon. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  I suspect Vivek is a little bit more open to it than Elon. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=134.8s)]
*  I'll take either one of them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  Vivek, Elon, if you're watching, please sign up. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=139.9s)]
*  America needs you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  All right, well, I don't think Johnson likes you now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=143.26000000000002s)]
*  Next time you guys see each other [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=146.36s)]
*  walking through the halls of Congress, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=147.72s)]
*  he's gonna probably kick you in the leg. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=149.4s)]
*  He is a good man, he's a friend, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=151.8s)]
*  he's been a friend for a long time, great person. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=153.8s)]
*  He's lost control of this process. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=157.14000000000001s)]
*  And this is, I don't know how he can remain in power. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=159.84s)]
*  We need Elon or Vivek as Speaker. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=163.54000000000002s)]
*  He's a friend and you just threw him overboard. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=165.52s)]
*  Man, politics is tough, Senator Lee. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=167.88s)]
*  It is, especially when you try to jam an entire country [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=170.34s)]
*  with the 1,500 page bill that nobody's read [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=173.34s)]
*  and you try to trick them and bully them into doing it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=177.44s)]
*  Some of us take that personally, Jesse. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, no, I don't like it either. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=181.4s)]
*  I think it's terrible and we gotta stop doing it [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  and it's gotta stop now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=185.44s)]
*  All right, Senator Mike Lee, we'll see how it shakes out. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=186.88s)]
*  We'll let you know what Vivek or Elon say. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=189.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=192.6s)]
*  Fox News alert, the deadline. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=195.6s)]
*  The deadline to avert a government shutdown [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  is midnight tonight, Eastern time. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=198.96s)]
*  But a spending deal still looks out of reach [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  as Democrats and Republicans play the blame game. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  Aisha Hasni is live on Capitol Hill. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=207.22s)]
*  Hey, Aisha. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  Hey, good morning to you, Lawrence. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  I am keeping my eyes on the Speaker's office [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=211.68s)]
*  just down the hallway from me [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=214.16s)]
*  because there might be some activity here in the next hour. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=216.0s)]
*  I'll tell you about that in just a second. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=218.38s)]
*  First, I wanna get to what President-elect Donald Trump [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=219.84s)]
*  is thinking right now is not moving from his position [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=222.62s)]
*  after the bill imploded last night. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  He was actually up at one o'clock in the morning [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=228.56s)]
*  writing this on Truth Social. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=230.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=232.68s)]
*  He writes, Congress must get rid of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=233.5s)]
*  or extend out to perhaps 2029 that ridiculous debt ceiling. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=235.44s)]
*  Without this, we should never make a deal. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=239.88s)]
*  Remember, the pressure is on whoever is president. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=242.12s)]
*  Now, despite Trump and Elon Musk endorsing [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=245.04s)]
*  this 100-page skinny CR, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=248.58s)]
*  38 House Republicans still voted against it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=251.2s)]
*  They said they did not offset raising the debt ceiling. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=253.32s)]
*  They weren't happy with that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=256.72s)]
*  Johnson needed Democratic votes, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=258.04s)]
*  but leader Hakeem Jeffries came out last night [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=260.12s)]
*  and he said he wasn't gonna play ball. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=262.52000000000004s)]
*  The Musk-Johnson proposal is not serious. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=266.08000000000004s)]
*  It's laughable. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  Stream-maged Republicans are driving us [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=274.16s)]
*  to a government shutdown. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=277.04s)]
*  So now, President-elect Trump, JD Vance, Speaker Johnson, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=278.98s)]
*  pretty much every Republican is trashing the Democrats. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  The Democrats just voted to shut down the government, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=286.78s)]
*  even though we had a clean CR, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=290.61999999999995s)]
*  because they didn't wanna give the president [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=292.73999999999995s)]
*  negotiating leverage during his first term, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=294.97999999999996s)]
*  or during the first year of his new term. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=297.7s)]
*  And number two, because they would rather shut down [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=300.05999999999995s)]
*  the government and fight for global censorship. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=303.14s)]
*  They've asked for a shutdown, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=308.46s)]
*  and I think that's exactly what they're gonna do. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=309.73999999999995s)]
*  Okay, so the question is, what is next? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=312.09999999999997s)]
*  Apparently, it is back to the drawing board [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=314.36s)]
*  for Speaker Johnson. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=316.76s)]
*  What's the play tomorrow? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=318.8s)]
*  What's the plan? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=319.64s)]
*  State teachers. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=320.48s)]
*  Well, we keep hearing that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  You gonna run another bill tomorrow, though? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=325.2s)]
*  Okay, so apparently, Punchbowl is reporting [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=327.2s)]
*  that the speaker and JD Vance might be meeting [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=330.48s)]
*  with House Freedom Caucus members, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=334.56s)]
*  and one more person in the room, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=336.16s)]
*  it's very interesting, would be Trump's OMB director, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=337.56s)]
*  the nominee for that, Russell Vaught. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=342.0s)]
*  He's been on the Hill working the senators [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  through his confirmation process, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=347.68s)]
*  so he is here in Washington, D.C., [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=349.32s)]
*  and apparently, again, according to Punchbowl News, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=351.0s)]
*  those four parties will be meeting [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=353.96s)]
*  in the speaker's office this hour. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=356.68s)]
*  I will keep my eyes peeled. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=359.18s)]
*  I'll get over there right now and bring you any news [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=360.78s)]
*  at the top of the eight o'clock. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=363.34s)]
*  Right, thank you, Aisha. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=364.84s)]
*  I was reading in Punchbowl as well, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=366.44s)]
*  back to Aisha for just a moment, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=369.28s)]
*  regarding the incoming OMB guy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=371.0s)]
*  Aisha, Punchbowl has a note [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=374.0s)]
*  and talks about how he will be arguing, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  okay, they've got to extend the debt limit, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  you know, they've gotta lift it, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=381.76s)]
*  but it was when Kevin McCarthy in 2023 was speaker, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=383.3s)]
*  he actually led the opposition. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=387.2s)]
*  He's saying, we can't give them this, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=389.5s)]
*  and now he's saying, you gotta give us this, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=391.68s)]
*  and undoubtedly, the House Freedom Caucus [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=394.24s)]
*  is gonna bring that up with him. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=396.24s)]
*  Absolutely, they're gonna bring it up. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=398.0s)]
*  In fact, Kevin McCarthy's name has been brought up [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=399.32s)]
*  several times in the last 24 hours, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  because this is pretty much, I mean, this is deja vu. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=403.42s)]
*  People have been watching this and thinking [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=406.86s)]
*  this is exactly what happened to Kevin McCarthy [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=408.58000000000004s)]
*  at the end of the day. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=410.54s)]
*  He tried to throw things on the floor [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=411.58000000000004s)]
*  that didn't fly with his own conference, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=413.82s)]
*  and eventually, he didn't wanna see the government shut down, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=415.98s)]
*  so he put a clean CR on the floor. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=418.54s)]
*  It passed with Democratic votes, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  which is exactly what Speaker Johnson needs right now [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=423.3s)]
*  to avert a government shutdown. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=426.42s)]
*  So that's the crisis that Speaker Johnson finds himself in, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  and he doesn't wanna lose his speakership. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=432.0s)]
*  Remember, that's the next thing that's coming up [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=434.56s)]
*  in just less than a month. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=436.58s)]
*  He has to run for speaker again, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=438.28s)]
*  and he doesn't wanna go through [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=439.96s)]
*  what Kevin McCarthy went through. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=441.56s)]
*  Aisha, what are the chances that the government [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=442.84s)]
*  will shut down, because I know there are a lot [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=444.44s)]
*  of conservatives that are now demanding three days. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  Once they get the new bill, they want three days to read it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=448.56s)]
*  That's not gonna happen, Ainsley. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=452.76s)]
*  I think the 72-hour rule is out the window at this point, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=454.2s)]
*  and people are probably okay with that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=457.08s)]
*  Regular order is just out the window. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=460.04s)]
*  I think the longer we wait, the longer this goes, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=462.24s)]
*  and it's looking to be probably a mini shutdown. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=465.88s)]
*  They can still get this done sometime this afternoon. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=469.96s)]
*  We don't have a floor schedule yet. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=472.64s)]
*  We don't know when the first votes are going to be, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=475.28s)]
*  so if they can crank something out [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=477.72s)]
*  in the speaker's office this morning [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=479.32s)]
*  and get something on the floor this afternoon, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=480.76s)]
*  then it's really up to the Senate [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=482.56s)]
*  to whiz this through as quickly as possible tonight. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=484.28s)]
*  They'll stay as long as it takes. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=486.64s)]
*  Normally you get a sense of who thinks they benefit [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=488.4s)]
*  from a shutdown and who's gonna get the blame. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=491.2s)]
*  I get the sense that both sides are just unmoored [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=493.67999999999995s)]
*  by this whole thing. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=496.79999999999995s)]
*  There's no appetite for a shutdown. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  This is not good for any party. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=501.44s)]
*  I mean, no, because the opposing party [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=503.79999999999995s)]
*  will blame you for it, and that's exactly [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=506.84s)]
*  what's happening right now. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=508.67999999999995s)]
*  The only person that might be okay [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=509.76s)]
*  with a government shutdown might be Elon Musk, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=512.64s)]
*  because this actually speaks to why. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  If you have part of the government shutdown, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=517.36s)]
*  then it speaks to why you can get rid of parts [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=519.2s)]
*  of the government that aren't very important. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=522.08s)]
*  So with his work in Doge, his and Vivek Ramaswamy's, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=524.12s)]
*  but no, it's not good, politically speaking, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=527.52s)]
*  for either party to see a government shutdown, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=529.68s)]
*  even for a few days. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=532.12s)]
*  Although you do enjoy getting up [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=533.8s)]
*  and doing this breaking news with us in the morning. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=535.12s)]
*  So we benefit. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=536.96s)]
*  Yeah, we appreciate it, Aisha. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=539.04s)]
*  You know, I found myself conflicted with this debate. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=540.8s)]
*  I have been one that has advocated for regular order. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=544.8s)]
*  I feel like we should have the 12 appropriation bills, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=548.16s)]
*  but you're negotiating with half of the government. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=551.28s)]
*  I mean, you only have the House. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=554.3599999999999s)]
*  And so it gets to the point, you don't have that much leverage [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=556.64s)]
*  to say that you want regular order [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=562.2399999999999s)]
*  when you don't have full control. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=565.1999999999999s)]
*  I think it's much different when you have the presidents [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=566.56s)]
*  and you have the Senate, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=569.0s)]
*  and you promise that to the voters. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=570.4s)]
*  So, I mean, you gotta eventually say yes to something. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=572.52s)]
*  I'm gonna give you a sports analogy [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=576.24s)]
*  that I think is gonna benefit the country. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=577.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay. Okay, let's hear it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=579.0s)]
*  You might know football, but you're not in the huddle. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=580.24s)]
*  Elon Musk is not in the huddle. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=584.04s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy's not in the huddle. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  So as they're calling the play [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=587.9200000000001s)]
*  and they're dealing with all different kinds [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=589.48s)]
*  and in opposition, it might be easier to sit on the outside [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=591.24s)]
*  and go, this is so clear what play to call. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=594.2s)]
*  But you do not know what it's like actually doing the deal [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=596.44s)]
*  with so little power and leverage. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  So you could say, yeah, right, that shouldn't be in. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=603.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that shouldn't be in. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=604.52s)]
*  But you know what is in? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=605.36s)]
*  Because that's in, this is in this. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=606.18s)]
*  So they came back and they restructured at the last minute. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=607.88s)]
*  The only criticism would be, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=611.0799999999999s)]
*  could you have not done this earlier? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=612.6s)]
*  Could you have not done this in October, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=614.52s)]
*  right after the election? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=616.28s)]
*  Because just before we had Speaker Johnson on two days ago, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=617.4399999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk at 4.15 in the morning said, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=620.6s)]
*  you can't pass this bill. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=622.76s)]
*  And that was the beginning of the end. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=623.9599999999999s)]
*  Not in the huddle. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=625.88s)]
*  He was not in the huddle. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=626.8399999999999s)]
*  The question is, who was he huddling with? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=628.24s)]
*  According to the speaker, he was huddling with him. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=630.0s)]
*  Obviously, Elon Musk and Donald Trump can kill a bill. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=633.08s)]
*  They said kill that bill because they wanted the new one [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=637.6s)]
*  that had the lifting of the debt ceiling [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=640.52s)]
*  because Donald Trump doesn't want that. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=642.6800000000001s)]
*  So going forward, there are a couple of different options. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=644.36s)]
*  They say today, the plan B from yesterday, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=647.12s)]
*  they could actually vote on that again today. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=650.6s)]
*  It probably would fail again. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=653.08s)]
*  Also, Speaker Johnson could meet with Jeffries. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=654.96s)]
*  Okay, what's it gonna take to get some buy-in [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=658.76s)]
*  from the Democrats on this? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=661.36s)]
*  They could drop the debt ceiling requirement [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=663.52s)]
*  that Donald Trump has put out there. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=666.76s)]
*  And that's the reason they lost 38 Republicans yesterday [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=668.16s)]
*  or just have a one or two week CR. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=671.16s)]
*  Just kick the can until the end of the year, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=674.84s)]
*  the first of January, after everybody goes [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=678.88s)]
*  and drinks a lot of eggnog. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=681.92s)]
*  There are about 30, my sources are telling me, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=683.16s)]
*  30 individuals that will never support a CU. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=686.16s)]
*  There are 30 individuals that will never support [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  getting rid of the debt ceiling. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=693.92s)]
*  So it's gonna be very difficult to pass [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=695.0799999999999s)]
*  if you put those in. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=696.52s)]
*  I love that picture that Elon posted [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=699.12s)]
*  where you've got the big stack. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=700.8s)]
*  It was 1,500 pages, now it's 116 pages. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=702.0s)]
*  But if you, Ralph Norman was on Fox and Friends First [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=705.0799999999999s)]
*  earlier and he said, not enough time to read it, A, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=708.12s)]
*  and then threw in the debt limit at the last minute. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=710.8s)]
*  He had a problem with that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=713.12s)]
*  He said, we can't have a limit, there's the picture. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=714.12s)]
*  That's the first bill and then now that's the revised one [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=716.8399999999999s)]
*  on the right. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=719.66s)]
*  He said, we can't have a limited shutdown, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=722.12s)]
*  which means it wouldn't affect our military. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=723.12s)]
*  It wouldn't affect TSA workers, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=724.96s)]
*  because a lot of people are traveling today [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=726.72s)]
*  and into next week. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=728.62s)]
*  They just don't get paid. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=729.46s)]
*  And Chip Roy said, it still spends too much money. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=730.44s)]
*  He said it's $110 billion unpaid for [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=734.52s)]
*  and he has a problem with that, too much pork. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=737.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, well, let's shut it down then. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=739.44s)]
*  But I just hope that when they do have full power, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=742.08s)]
*  that there's some sort of plan. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=747.84s)]
*  I'm all for a fight. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=750.0s)]
*  I'm all for giving the voters what you promised them. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=751.48s)]
*  But if they have full control [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=755.4s)]
*  and we're still at this same point, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=757.32s)]
*  I mean, we were talking about the Elon Musk thing, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=759.6s)]
*  but there were the moderates and the conservatives [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=762.2s)]
*  that were opposed to that bill [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=765.16s)]
*  that was originally the first CR. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=766.64s)]
*  So they got, after Elon got involved, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=769.4s)]
*  there were more people that came to the table. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=772.82s)]
*  Now we have just the conservative wing of the party [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=774.52s)]
*  that is upset about the spending. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=777.8s)]
*  While Democrats are in control of half of the government. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=780.76s)]
*  So the last thing Elon Musk put out is this, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=782.4399999999999s)]
*  first of all, I'm not the author of this proposal, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=784.6s)]
*  credit Trump, Vance and Speaker Johnson. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=786.6s)]
*  That was before it went down. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=789.16s)]
*  Now let's say this, don't think that Donald Trump [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=790.52s)]
*  and Elon Musk are not on the same page. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=793.52s)]
*  So they're not working against each other. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=795.56s)]
*  That's what Elizabeth Warren wants to do it. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=798.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=800.4399999999999s)]
*  So you were accepted, wait, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=801.28s)]
*  Angel, will you accept my sports analogy? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=802.2s)]
*  I actually, I got that one. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=804.2s)]
*  I understand what that one means. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=805.66s)]
*  You kept it simple for me. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=806.84s)]
*  You didn't go into too much detail. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=807.92s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUH__BD6miY&t=810.7199999999999s)]
