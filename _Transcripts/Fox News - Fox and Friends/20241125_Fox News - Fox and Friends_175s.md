# Lawmakers, companies push back on DEI policies after Trump win: 'Waking up'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s)
*  So American companies and lawmakers are reportedly already rolling back diversity equity and inclusion [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=0.0s)]
*  initiatives and response to Trump's big win [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=5.84s)]
*  Devin Westhill is the president and general counsel for the Center of equal opportunity. He joins us now Devin [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=8.56s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining the program. So [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=14.16s)]
*  What is the pushback now that an election has been had? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=17.72s)]
*  Well, look [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=23.0s)]
*  lawmakers are pushing back companies are pushing back against the DEI enterprise and of course [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=24.64s)]
*  President Trump has been saying for almost a decade that there's a real problem here [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  DEI is not about true quality of opportunity true diversity [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=33.84s)]
*  What it is is a multi-billion dollar industry that pushes a far-left ideological [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=38.92s)]
*  Orthodoxy, I think American people are actually [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=44.52s)]
*  Waking up to this as well a few research just came out with a couple studies last week [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=47.88s)]
*  indicating that the vast majority of workers in this country are increasingly saying that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=53.24s)]
*  Dei does not have any place in the workplace and that it shouldn't be there [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=58.96s)]
*  Attorneys general from 19 different states have said look [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=64.36s)]
*  You know Secretary of Defense, you should make sure that our military doesn't have DEI Enterprise [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=68.2s)]
*  Affirmative action or race preferences in it as well and they copied Pete Hex to that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=74.68s)]
*  So I'm expecting that there's gonna be a huge push with the new administration [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=79.6s)]
*  Against the DEI enterprises I call it [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=83.84s)]
*  Do you think it's the whole metrics the quota system [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  Because I think most folks just want to equal shot at getting the job [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=90.4s)]
*  I think what the problem is is now is the promise of outcomes, right? I [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=95.2s)]
*  Think that's right. And look, I will share a dirty little secret with you when it comes to the DEI Enterprise [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  It really is just an elite thing [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  It is this this is for the egghead [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=109.68s)]
*  Laptop class that during kovat were staying at home and and and making lots of money on their laptops [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=113.94s)]
*  The people who run this country 90% or more of the country is against the DEI Enterprise [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=121.25999999999999s)]
*  These are folks during kovat who actually had to go and work their frontline workers. They were emergency personnel [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=127.38s)]
*  There are people who are cleaning [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=133.57999999999998s)]
*  Grocery stores and so forth. They couldn't care less about DEI [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=135.18s)]
*  What they want is to be able to feed their families bring home a living wage and to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=138.46s)]
*  Make sure that they can achieve the American dream for themselves [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=144.62s)]
*  Homeownership that type of thing and that's what I think the pushback against the DEI Enterprise is about at most allowing everybody [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=148.18s)]
*  No matter their race their color who they sleep with [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=154.94s)]
*  to to obtain the American dream [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JwPsS8y2s&t=158.18s)]
