# Springfield, Ohio resident: This is a dystopian nightmare
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw)
*  Now to Springfield, Ohio, a town of just 58,000, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=0.0s)]
*  now at the center of the migrant crisis, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=3.46s)]
*  with at least 15,000 Haitians arriving since 2020, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=5.36s)]
*  now forcing the state to send state troopers in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=8.96s)]
*  and set aside millions of dollars to deal with the crisis. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=11.5s)]
*  Our next guest has lived in Springfield for more than 30 years [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=14.64s)]
*  and says it no longer feels like her home. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=17.54s)]
*  Diana Daniels joins us now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=21.54s)]
*  So, Diana, according to the reports, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=23.42s)]
*  the schools have been overrun, the clinics have been overrun, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=25.88s)]
*  and now a lot of jobs have been taken as well. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=28.78s)]
*  What is life like there now? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=31.380000000000003s)]
*  It's like living in a dystopian nightmare, yeah? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=34.36s)]
*  You hope you wake up and it's 2019 again, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=37.2s)]
*  and then you realize it's 2024, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=39.86s)]
*  and it's the same thing over and over again, day after day. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=41.660000000000004s)]
*  Um, it's hard sometimes to get up in the morning [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=45.260000000000005s)]
*  and hear residents that I've known for years struggle. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=49.18000000000001s)]
*  This is a paycheck-to-paycheck kind of town, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=53.94s)]
*  a working class, and the citizens that depend on [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=57.540000000000006s)]
*  our social services, like health care, a rocking horse, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=60.74s)]
*  going down to the Social Security Office for benefits, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=65.44s)]
*  are waiting in line, and they're not getting [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=69.38s)]
*  the services they need. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=71.02000000000001s)]
*  And it breaks my heart to see people that I taught [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=72.72s)]
*  and their children experiencing this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=79.06s)]
*  So I took it upon myself to make sure that I showed up [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  at every City Commission meeting pleading our case, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=84.58s)]
*  and if it took something like this to get the spotlight [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=89.06s)]
*  flashed on us, then so be it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=93.02s)]
*  We've needed help for several years, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=95.86s)]
*  and maybe we're gonna finally get it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=99.84s)]
*  The sad thing is, is it's more of my money being spent [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=101.5s)]
*  on a problem that we did not create. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=105.34s)]
*  So, Diana, let's talk about that, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=107.0s)]
*  because you take great umbrage with some of the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=109.02s)]
*  characterizations that people tried to make about, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=112.08s)]
*  make about you and people in your town, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=114.3s)]
*  saying that you're hateful people just because [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=115.78s)]
*  you're bringing attention to the issue. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=118.14s)]
*  And some of those comments are being made by people [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=124.18s)]
*  that I've known for many years, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=126.68s)]
*  and that's probably the hardest thing to deal with, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=129.06s)]
*  because this city has always been a close-knit community. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=132.66s)]
*  We have pockets of neighborhoods, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=136.22s)]
*  and what's happening is a disruption [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=138.24s)]
*  of the smaller neighborhoods, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=142.06s)]
*  and it has never been a race issue. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=143.82000000000002s)]
*  It's about color, it's not about color, it's about culture. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=147.56s)]
*  Your once close-knit community has now been changed, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=151.3s)]
*  and there are people in your neighborhood [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=155.46s)]
*  that you don't know, that don't speak your language, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  that live a different lifestyle from you, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  and it's gonna cause some tension, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=161.74s)]
*  but it is a different culture that we're dealing with, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=164.94s)]
*  and I've tried and tried and tried to push that issue, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  but it's not helpful when our own city government [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=171.46s)]
*  has printed those very comments in city documents. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=175.66s)]
*  Who do you blame for this? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=179.76s)]
*  That Springfield faces is race, and it's not. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  I apologize, Diana, but who do you blame for this issue? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=184.0s)]
*  Because we got a national election coming up, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  and there is one person that is control of the border, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=189.14s)]
*  and that's the commander-in-chief, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=192.74s)]
*  and he sets the policy for that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=194.22s)]
*  through the Homeland Security Secretary. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=196.12s)]
*  His vice president wants to be the next president. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=198.42s)]
*  Who do you hold accountable for this surge of migrants [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=200.9s)]
*  that are now in your community? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=203.86s)]
*  Well, it certainly is a top-down, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=206.5s)]
*  and it's also a bottom-up. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=208.5s)]
*  So how did Springfield get the target put on its back [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=210.98000000000002s)]
*  for this many Haitians? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=216.28s)]
*  And don't forget, we also had a surge of Hispanics [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=219.58s)]
*  from 2014 on. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=222.86s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=225.52s)]
*  And that's what a team and I have been investigating [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=227.02s)]
*  for the last year is the why. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=230.62s)]
*  Why did this happen to us? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=234.16s)]
*  Who is responsible? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=235.44s)]
*  How did they get, how did that happen? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  And then follow the money. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=238.8s)]
*  And it's very difficult with our limited resources [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=240.26000000000002s)]
*  to tease that out, but it is from the top down, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=242.58s)]
*  but it's also from the bottom up. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=246.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's such a valid point. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=247.84s)]
*  Diana, I hope things get better. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=250.72s)]
*  We'll continue reporting on this story. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=252.72s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQm_EAmLhJw&t=254.18s)]
