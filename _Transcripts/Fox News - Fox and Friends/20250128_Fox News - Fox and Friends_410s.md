# Migrant encounters at the border 'plummeting' as ICE raids ramp up: 'A swift crackdown'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE)
*  All right breaking news DHS secretary Kristi Noem is actually right here in New York City at this hour where? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=0.0s)]
*  Ice raids are underway with a dangerous suspect already taken off the streets [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Griff Jenkins has the breaking details on the sanctuary the operation this sanctuary city right here in New York Griff [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=12.8s)]
*  Good morning guys the crackdown in the Big Apple is underway expected to last all week long [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=19.84s)]
*  The cartels are undoubtedly starting to feel the heat of the new Trump administration in fact [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=25.36s)]
*  We're just learning moments ago, and we can take a look again at Kristi Noem secretary Noem's video [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=30.44s)]
*  You see here in New York City that from overnight making lots of arrests [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  Noem adding to her tweet about this saying quote dirtbags like this will continue to be removed from our streets [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=41.32s)]
*  But we're learning that already they have rescued a Dominican national with an Interpol red [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=47.84s)]
*  Notice that he was wanted for a double homicide in his country [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=53.059999999999995s)]
*  We'll continue to see more of these sort of things now this comes after ice already elsewhere outside of New York have made nearly [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=57.9s)]
*  1200 arrests and lodged another 850 ice detainers and it comes as the numbers at the border are [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=65.78s)]
*  plummeting Border Patrol sources telling Fox they've encountered [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=74.02s)]
*  582 illegal crossings on Sunday that number is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=78.42s)]
*  Unbelievable not a single sector recorded over 200 [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=82.58s)]
*  That's something neither Bill Mollusk or I have ever seen happen and over a decade of covering the border [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=85.62s)]
*  And it's a stark contrast from the 1200 to 1400 daily encounters in Biden's last week in office [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=91.58000000000001s)]
*  And it's a far cry from Biden's record numbers in 2023 you will recall topped [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=97.22s)]
*  11,000 I remember being an eagle pass when we saw more than 3,000 in a single day now [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  It's closer to 60 in the DEA also stepping up out in Denver agents seizing [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=108.9s)]
*  130,000 fentanyl pills while arresting two illegal migrants with ties to the Sinaloa and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=117.3s)]
*  Jalisco cartels now congressman Tom Emmer had this to say to you guys earlier listen [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=122.58s)]
*  People want to be safe and secure in their communities. They are moving swiftly and quickly and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  Very straightforward on removing all these rapists murderers gang members that have come across our southern border [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=133.54s)]
*  and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=141.06s)]
*  Frankly, I wish they'd be doing it in my home state of Minnesota. Let's get these bad actors out of our country [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=142.22s)]
*  And later today what we're watching guys secretary no [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=148.01999999999998s)]
*  I'm is said to address her DHS staff for the first time and deliver her vision for the agency [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  So she was in New York [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=155.78s)]
*  She'll be back here in Washington [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=157.01999999999998s)]
*  And I suspect she'll have a clear message for the cartels the business as usual is over now for them guys [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=158.74s)]
*  She's letting them do the job. Hey grip. You've never seen anything like this before [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=164.58s)]
*  No, I have been covering the border for more than a decade and to have such a swift crackdown [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=168.86s)]
*  To bring the numbers to so low. It's really something that I've never seen and I'm quite surprised [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=176.10000000000002s)]
*  They were able to get those numbers that low [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=183.18s)]
*  That's why you saw that video the Texas DPS lieutenant Oliver has put of the gunfire being captured fortunately [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=185.14s)]
*  No one hurt but cartels firing on board patrol agents on front on Island Brian [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  That's known as cartel Island [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=196.66s)]
*  It's a little island that sat in the in the Rio Grande River that the agents were always [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=198.61999999999998s)]
*  Combating against the cartels because they use it as sort of a basing operations for smuggling [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=204.82s)]
*  But yet last year Texas we took the island back over [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=208.94s)]
*  Cleared it and tried to take a hold but the cartels what you're seeing with this gunfire is [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=212.82s)]
*  desperation Brian because the cartels realize how fast and how swift the Trump crackdown has been an agent there in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=218.78s)]
*  RGV yesterday texting with me saying sadly they fear they may see a little bit more of this sort of aggression by the cartels because [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=227.26s)]
*  They realize just how swift and harsh this crackdown is and they don't want that that bad for business [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=235.18s)]
*  Thanks good. Well, if we look at the we're looking at these pictures in New York with the Secretary [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=242.66s)]
*  Of Homeland Security out there with US Marshals. You got FBI there that are on the ground [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=248.5s)]
*  Yeah, you also got DEA US Marshals [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  And then you also have a DOJ representative to handle the legal process to make sure they got the right person [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=256.86s)]
*  But back to the cartel as well. They're losing money when people don't cross the border [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=262.9s)]
*  They're not getting that 20 to 30 thousand dollars a pop that also hurts their drug enterprise as well, right Griff [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=268.16s)]
*  They are losing millions a day and Lawrence you raised a really important point that I think you're gonna start hearing from [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=274.72s)]
*  Secretary Noem and others when you were talking about the DEA ice BP [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=281.8s)]
*  That's what they say when we heard from the Biden administration the quote whole of government approach [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=287.56s)]
*  Well, it didn't work under the last administration [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=293.14s)]
*  But a whole approach whole of government approach is all assets all law enforcement agencies [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=295.68s)]
*  Going out there in this case with Secretary Noem boots on the ground as well [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=301.58s)]
*  And we saw Tom Homan boots on the ground as well. This is what a full force effort looks like [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=306.08s)]
*  Yeah, and we did and Griff we don't know whether or not [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=312.26s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security gave the city of New York, which is a sanctuary city a heads up [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=315.8s)]
*  But we do know that Tom Homan met with the mayor here a couple of weeks ago [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=321.58s)]
*  But what's interesting is those images of Kristi Noem and they they're circulating right now on X [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=325.56s)]
*  images like that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=332.76s)]
*  And also the images we've seen over the last week or so where people are on those [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=334.52s)]
*  Deportation flights back to their country of origin or wherever they go [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=339.76s)]
*  That is going to have a chilling impact on the number of people who are [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=344.64s)]
*  Still willing to have the cartels try to get them across the country across the border because they realize wait a minute [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=349.44s)]
*  It's no longer Joe Biden in charge. There's a new sheriff literally in town and maybe we shouldn't go [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=355.20000000000005s)]
*  That's exactly right Steve at the end of the day for decades [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=361.68s)]
*  The story of the border has been one of push and pull factors [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  The pull factors were a lax border security the last administration [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=370.64000000000004s)]
*  So cartels knew they had free roam to operate those photos of Secretary Noem have one special [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=374.92s)]
*  Intended recipient and that is the Sinaloa and Jalisco [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=382.32s)]
*  cartels down in Mexico to know that it's not going to be the same and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  Everyone will be on the ground full force trying to stop it. Right. They might as well get out of the cartel business [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=391.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much grip. Thank you, Greg. I'm Steve juicy [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff212OMmbWE&t=396.8s)]
