# This is part of Hamas’ ‘absurd’ war strategy: Israel expert
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8)
*  A Fox News alert. Israeli forces hitting key Hamas targets in Gaza. The IDF taking down [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=0.0s)]
*  more than 2,500 terror hubs since its ground offensive began. While at the same time ramping [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=6.2s)]
*  up strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer joins [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  us live from Tel Aviv with an update. Ron, thank you for joining us. From your perspective, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=19.16s)]
*  we're a month from those horrific terror attacks on Israeli civilians. Where are we today? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=25.2s)]
*  For our American audience, what is the state of Israel doing? What's the state of the war? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=30.96s)]
*  Well, we're certainly closer to victory because we first hit the terrorists from the air and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=35.04s)]
*  now we're going in on the ground. I'd love to tell you that we could eliminate Hamas, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=41.04s)]
*  dismantle all its military capabilities, end its rule in Gaza, and prevent Gaza from becoming [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=46.4s)]
*  a threat, a continuous threat to Israel without going in the ground, but that can't be done. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=52.4s)]
*  So our forces went on the ground a little over a week ago and I think they've been very successful [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=56.48s)]
*  at rooting out a lot of the terror cells and killing a lot of terrorists. I think there's been [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=61.36s)]
*  upwards of 2,000 terrorists who've been killed, probably closer to 3,000 at least, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=67.28s)]
*  because we don't know because a lot of them are in these underground terror tunnel network and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=72.24s)]
*  when we bomb them, we don't know exactly how many people are down there, but it's very tough [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=76.48s)]
*  fighting and our Israeli soldiers are doing it in a very deliberate way. We are trying everything [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=80.56s)]
*  we can do to get the civilians out of harm's way. Just in the last few hours, we've told people [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=85.52s)]
*  from the north again, we have a safe corridor allowing them to go from north to south, but we [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=91.04s)]
*  have an enemy that is embedded in the civilian population. The IDF just released some videos [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  about how they're using children's swimming pools and how they're using schools. We know they use [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=100.4s)]
*  mosques. We know they use hospitals. They use all of the civilian infrastructure to embed themselves [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=105.04s)]
*  how this underground terror tunnel network, so going and getting rooting this enemy out is not [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=110.16s)]
*  a simple thing, but we have no other choice because we're not going to allow Hamas to survive [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=115.28s)]
*  in Gaza. It's not going to happen. So I think we're closer to victory today than we were a month ago [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=120.88s)]
*  and we'll continue to push forward until we achieve our military objective. Absolutely. It remains [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=125.6s)]
*  the same. You cannot tolerate a terror state on right next to you. Yet here we are, Ron, one week [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=130.72s)]
*  into the ground portion of this, as you just laid out, one week and the UN is yelling ceasefire [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=136.96s)]
*  and, you know, groups, countries across the globe are yelling ceasefire. You've also got an [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=142.72s)]
*  administration here in the United States, which initially was very supportive. You know, whatever [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=148.72s)]
*  you need to do. Now we're hearing pauses. They've got protests outside the White House. Are you [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=153.52s)]
*  concerned about America's support for Israel and how we saw Bibi Netanyahu say, hey, we're going, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=158.56s)]
*  we're not stopping here. What will the response be if there are more attempts to pull Israel back? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=165.04s)]
*  Look, we're not going to have a ceasefire with Hamas. It's like you having a ceasefire after [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=172.0s)]
*  the bombing of Pearl Harbor, you having a ceasefire with ISIS. It's absurd. And I was glad to see that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  the administration said they're not even asking for a ceasefire. As for humanitarian assistance, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=181.2s)]
*  we have tried to do everything we can to get that humanitarian assistance to flow. Remember, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  Israel's not in charge of Gaza. Hamas is. And all of that assistance is coming from the Egyptian [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=191.28s)]
*  side. I think today they're supposed to have a hundred trucks of food, water, medical equipment [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=195.52s)]
*  that should go to those people who need it, to UN facilities that are there where they're housing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=201.44s)]
*  people. There's also a safe area in the southwest part of Gaza. So we're certainly open to doing [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=206.88s)]
*  whatever we can to get the civilians out of harm's way. We have an enemy who wants to put the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=211.68s)]
*  civilians in harm's way. That's part of their war strategy. And it doesn't surprise me that after [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=215.76s)]
*  seven days, the world is calling for a ceasefire because listen, Pete, the world is very sympathetic [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=221.84s)]
*  to Israel when we're victims and very sympathetic to the Jewish people when we're victims. And then [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=228.16s)]
*  they'll give speeches of never again and never again. But when Israel is a victor, when Israel [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=232.16s)]
*  is actually doing what it has to do in order to survive, in order to defeat the enemy, that's when [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=236.88s)]
*  the world begins to turn on Israel. And I hope that the Biden administration will continue to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=241.76s)]
*  stand strong and push back against it. Those people that you see in the protests, they don't [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  want any kind of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. They want to remove the state of [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=251.2s)]
*  Israel. They say they want to free from the river to the sea. That means the end of Israel. That [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=255.28s)]
*  means a genocide against Jews. The president of the United States and all the leaders in the United [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=260.0s)]
*  States should speak very forcefully against it. And I guarantee if you asked any of those protesters [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=264.64s)]
*  what they want for Israel, they would say just the destruction of Israel. And if you ask them [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=268.8s)]
*  what they think about America, you'd be very surprised. Maybe you won't, but some people [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=272.8s)]
*  would be very surprised about their answer, what they think about the United States. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=276.56s)]
*  They don't have anything good to say about the United States either, Ron. You're exactly right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=280.32s)]
*  Very usually those people who hate Israel hate America. No doubt they see us. Our enemies see us [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  as you and we are united together. We share the same values. We support the same causes. We are [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=290.24s)]
*  two nations who believe in freedom and democracy and human rights. And we stand against an enemy [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=297.12s)]
*  that believes in none of these things. And all of those people who are saying, well, we want to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  support the Palestinians. Why would you support a terror organization that is committed not just to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  the genocide of Jews, but brutalizes its own people, is misogynist, kills gays? Why would any [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=312.32000000000005s)]
*  self-respecting progressive ever support an organization like Hamas? It's shameful. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=319.92s)]
*  It's a great question. You're exactly right. Ron Durber, God bless you. God speed in your efforts ahead. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz-EBe6kET8&t=324.56s)]
