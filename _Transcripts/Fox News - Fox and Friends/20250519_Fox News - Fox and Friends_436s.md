# Peter Doocy: This was the first-ever email from Biden's personal office
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw)
*  Okay, we have a Fox News alert. Messages of support are rolling in from around the country [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=0.0s)]
*  after former President Biden announced he's been diagnosed with prostate cancer. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=5.28s)]
*  Our senior White House correspondent, Peter Ducey, is here with the latest. Peter? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=9.82s)]
*  Good morning. In the first ever email we received from a newly formed Biden personal office [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=13.82s)]
*  was about this cancer diagnosis. Part of their note said he was diagnosed with prostate cancer [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  characterized by a Gleason score of nine with metastasis to the bone. While this represents a [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=24.48s)]
*  more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone sensitive, which allows for [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  effective management. President Trump's reaction to that, Melania and I are saddened to hear about [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=35.76s)]
*  Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=42.08s)]
*  and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery. The Secretary of State Marco Rubio says, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Jeanette and I are united in prayer for the Biden family during this difficult time. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=53.36s)]
*  Kamala Harris says Joe is a fighter and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=57.68000000000001s)]
*  resilience and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership. We are hopeful for a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=63.28s)]
*  fast and speedy recovery. And then Barack Obama says nobody's done more to find breakthrough [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=67.92s)]
*  treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe. I'm certain he will fight this challenge with his [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=72.72s)]
*  trademark resolve and grace. There was, of course, a ton of focus on President Biden's health while [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  he was in office, but most of it focused on cognitive abilities and whether or not the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=82.88s)]
*  Parkinson's specialist who kept getting cleared into the White House was treating the president. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=87.44s)]
*  There were a lot fewer questions about cancer screenings, especially after July 21st of last [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=91.28s)]
*  year when he said he was not going to seek a second term. Friday, we all heard that Robert Herr [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=96.08s)]
*  audio come out and the Biden office was quiet about it. Now we know Friday is also the day [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=102.0s)]
*  they got news from the doctor about this diagnosis back to you. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=108.0s)]
*  All right. Well, our thoughts and prayers are with his family. So definitely don't wish this on [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=112.16s)]
*  anyone. Thank you so much. Thanks, Peter. All right. Let's bring in Fox News senior medical [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=116.56s)]
*  analyst, Dr. Mark Siegel to respond to this. Doc Siegel, we got word about this yesterday, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=121.04s)]
*  your reaction to how advanced it seems. Really, really surprising that it's this advanced at the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=125.92s)]
*  time of diagnosis. Now you can miss prostate cancer, but most of the time, regular screening [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=131.84s)]
*  picks it up. A sitting president, I would expect to have advanced screening, should not be subject [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  to debate what kind of screening you do a PSA for sure every year on a- Would a PSA test have picked [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=144.72s)]
*  that up? Not all the time, but there's other tests that we do that are several different kinds of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  tests you can do in addition to the PSA. But the PSA would pick it up the majority of the time. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=156.24s)]
*  If he's diagnosed by somebody feeling a nodule, that's not these days the way we do it most of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=162.96s)]
*  the time. Also, most of the time, prostate cancer is diagnosed without symptoms. It has to get really [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=168.0s)]
*  pretty far advanced usually before you could have urinary symptoms leading towards urinary retention. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=176.0s)]
*  Thank God they found it. He's a fighter. He's been through a tremendous amount in his life. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=181.12s)]
*  Non-politically we're talking. You know, with his son, with his wife, with his daughter. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=186.08s)]
*  Two aneurysms. Two aneurysms, atrial fibrillation. You know, he's been through a lot health-wise, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=190.88000000000002s)]
*  but I am absolutely shocked that they didn't find this earlier. Dr. Siegel, now that we know it's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=197.36s)]
*  metastasized, it's in his bone, how long has this cancer been in his body? Well, it's aggressive, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  Ainsley, which means that it's moving pretty fast. But I- and I can't tell you for sure, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=208.08s)]
*  but he didn't just get this overnight. He's had this for months and months, even if it is aggressive. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=212.32s)]
*  It's a Gleason 9, which means under the microscope, group five, under the microscope, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=216.72s)]
*  it's quite aggressive. They find that it's responsive to antitestosterone type therapy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=221.12s)]
*  We have that. We have it in oral form now. We have it in an injectable form. So he will probably get [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=227.28s)]
*  that treatment. He should get personalized treatment too. There's a lot of debate about [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=232.56s)]
*  whether you should do surgery, whether you should do radiation, what you should do to that bone [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  metastasy. The fact that there's only one is better than if there was more than that. That's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=240.48s)]
*  good. He has to be monitored very, very closely. Again, he needs a personalized approach. So what [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  do you do about the spreading to the bone? Well, usually you would just give the anti-hormone [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=250.64s)]
*  therapy, hope it shrinks. Maybe you would radiate that lesion to the bone. We now have the most [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=256.96s)]
*  focused radiation. Over the last five years, the entire treatment for prostate cancer has changed, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=260.96s)]
*  but still his five-year survival rate might be under 50 percent, even with all of that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=266.8s)]
*  The key here, Charlie, is early response. Will he have early response? They're going to see the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=272.64s)]
*  first six months how he does with his initial therapy. But again, I can't emphasize enough. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=278.16s)]
*  Two things. Personalized approach. I might say hormone therapy. They might be saying hormone [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  therapy, but with a former president, they might do a smattering of things. Two, early diagnosis [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=287.52s)]
*  is key. For everyone out there, every male out there over the age of 45, get your prostate checked. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  I personally don't say a certain age is too old. I say keep going. What's the prognosis here? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=300.0s)]
*  Is he going to have to do chemo? You mentioned radiation. Have the prostate removed? What would [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=307.84s)]
*  you recommend if this were your relative? Well, I would recommend all of those options being on [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=312.4s)]
*  the table. Right now, these days, we do a team approach. Radiation oncology is really strong, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=317.36s)]
*  by the way, at NYU. That's a huge possible approach. The hormone therapy, because again, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=322.24s)]
*  if it's dependent on testosterone, you can block testosterone production in the body. That's a big [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=329.04s)]
*  part of the approach. A lot of surgeons would take out this prostate. You can do it robotically now, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=333.76s)]
*  you know, like literally, with a tiny incision and almost no blood loss. Dr. Tawari over at [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=341.52s)]
*  Matsani, one of the best in the country, the father-in-law of Vivek Ramaswamy, one of the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=347.2s)]
*  best in the country. We have great prostate surgeons at NYU around the country that could [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=351.2s)]
*  take this out, maybe as part of the treatment. Right. Hormone therapy for sure. Do you think [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=355.68s)]
*  they should be public what his treatment is? I think they should be public at exactly when this [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=360.64s)]
*  was diagnosed. Brian, we were talking last week about when were the cognitive issues diagnosed. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=365.84s)]
*  I want to know when this was found exactly. We know how many visits Dr. Connors made to the White [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  House over and over again, correct? I want to know why. I want to know exactly when this was found. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm believing them it was just found, but then it's found advanced. You know, I have to believe [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=381.12s)]
*  them, but I want full disclosure here and I would like the treatment because look, this is in England [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=385.84s)]
*  where they don't tell us even what type of cancer the person has. We want to use this for teaching, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=390.0s)]
*  to teach people out there what they should do. They're looking at the former leader of the free [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=395.68s)]
*  world. President Trump was really kind about saying he's sad and Melania's sad and we're all [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=399.52s)]
*  sad, but now we need to learn from it so that we can use it to teach our own patients. Is he in any pain? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=405.04s)]
*  Well, he's going to be in pain from that bone lesion. That's why they got to shrink that as [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=410.56s)]
*  soon as possible. They're going to have to use pain meds. They want to probably radiate that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=414.24s)]
*  They got to get that shrunk down to decrease the pain. All right, Dr. Segal, we'll talk to you again. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=418.32s)]
*  Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Good to see you. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GHIuhsnmkw&t=423.12s)]
