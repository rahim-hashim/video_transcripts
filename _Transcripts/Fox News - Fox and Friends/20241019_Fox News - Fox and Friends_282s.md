# Mysterious drones swarmed over US military base for 17 days
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y)
*  Well, national security concerns are on the rise. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=0.0s)]
*  We learn a fleet of mystery drones were spotted flying over US military bases in Virginia [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  last year for 17 straight days. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=8.32s)]
*  Chuck DeVore is a retired Army Lieutenant Colonel and Vice President of the Texas Public [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=11.6s)]
*  Policy Foundation, and he joins us now to react. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=15.08s)]
*  Chuck, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=18.68s)]
*  You wrote an op-ed about this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=20.44s)]
*  This happened a year ago. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=21.76s)]
*  We're just now learning about it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=22.88s)]
*  Pretty shocking. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=24.88s)]
*  What do we know about these drones? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=26.22s)]
*  Well, Will, first of all, thanks for having me on. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=29.16s)]
*  But these drones were large. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=31.64s)]
*  Some of them were as large as 20 feet long. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=33.4s)]
*  These are the sorts of drones that would have to be launched likely off of a ship offshore. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=36.44s)]
*  They also had smaller quadcopters that came down off of the larger mothership drones that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=42.4s)]
*  hovered just above the ground. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=47.6s)]
*  This happened for 17 straight nights at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, starting on Pearl [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=50.44s)]
*  Harbor Day, December 7th. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=57.36s)]
*  And when they started, Will, what ended up happening is you had endless meetings in the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=59.92s)]
*  White House. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=64.48s)]
*  Instead of the warriors defending the base and defending our nation, the Biden-Harris [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=65.48s)]
*  administration dispatched battalions of lawyers to try to figure out what to do. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=70.28s)]
*  And at the end of the day, they were paralyzed and inaction did nothing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=75.2s)]
*  And then the drone flight simply stopped. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=79.64s)]
*  OK, so I have a couple of questions I need to understand. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  First, so you said they were large enough that they probably would have had to be launched [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  from sea, from a ship off the coast. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  It seems inconceivable that would escape America's attention in terms of our surveillance, our [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  spying from a foreign power. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  So I don't know how this happens or how... [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  I guess, Chuck, I don't know how big a threat I'm supposed to take this as. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  I don't know who could have possibly done this. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, one of the ships was in fact inspected by the Coast Guard and they couldn't find anything. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=113.16s)]
*  The thing is that there were several other suspicious ships in the region that they never got to. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=117.16s)]
*  And, Will, it gets worse. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=122.16s)]
*  Just a couple of months earlier, there were several mystery drone flights over our nuclear [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=124.16s)]
*  testing range in Nevada, just north of Las Vegas. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=129.16s)]
*  And again, nothing was done. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=133.16s)]
*  And it gets even worse. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=135.16s)]
*  Some of the FBI agents that have been assigned to look into this have reported drones flying [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=138.12s)]
*  over their homes as if to say, hey, we know where you are. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=143.12s)]
*  So I really think that what this does is it boils down to an administration that doesn't [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=148.12s)]
*  take these threats seriously. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=153.12s)]
*  You just had on the previous segment a drone attack on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=154.12s)]
*  house. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=159.12s)]
*  Of course, we've seen with Russia and Ukraine the utility of drones. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=160.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=163.12s)]
*  And yet, somehow we're preventing our warriors from defending their own bases by saying, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=165.08s)]
*  oh no, you need to get permission from the attorney general or from Secretary of Homeland [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=170.08s)]
*  Security Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=175.08s)]
*  No, that's wrong. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=177.08s)]
*  Base commanders have an inherent authority within their command to defend their bases. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=178.08s)]
*  Well, why wasn't that done, Chuck? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=184.08s)]
*  That'll be my final question for you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=186.08s)]
*  OK, there's the issue of where these came from. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=187.08s)]
*  The second, why wasn't anything done? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=189.08s)]
*  Well, the fear was there may be some collateral damage that could happen. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  They also wanted to use some of these advanced teams that they had, these anti-drone teams. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  There's only two of them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  Mayorkas has not allowed more to be built. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  The problem with worrying about collateral damage is that any damage that would happen [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  would be entirely the fault of the People's Republic of China. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  It's the People's Republic of China that's sending these drones into U.S. airspace, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  violating our airspace just like they did with the spy balloon early last year that, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=221.0s)]
*  as you recall, they never shot down until it got over the Atlantic Ocean. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=226.0s)]
*  Just to clarify on the way out, is that known then, Chuck? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=231.0s)]
*  It's the PRC that flew these drones or that's your suspicion? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=235.0s)]
*  It's my suspicion because they weren't large enough. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=238.0s)]
*  They had to be nation-state actors. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=241.0s)]
*  And I believe only Russia and China have the capability to do this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=243.0s)]
*  And given the financial state of affairs with Russia versus China, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=247.96s)]
*  I'm 99.5% sure that these were the Chinese operating these drones. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=251.96s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=257.96s)]
*  Absolutely needs to be followed more understood about this future of warfare, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=258.96s)]
*  which is perhaps, as you point out with Benjamin Net Yahu, the present of warfare. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=263.96s)]
*  Chuck DeVore, thanks so much for being with us this morning. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=267.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teh37SJD09Y&t=270.96s)]
