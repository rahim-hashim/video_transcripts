# BREAKING: Official reveals cause of Chicago airport near-miss
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw)
*  Well, take a look at this video. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=0.0s)]
*  A plane at Chicago Midway International Airport. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=1.36s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=4.2s)]
*  It's trying to land when it had to take back off, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=4.68s)]
*  fly back up in the air when it saw that private plane right [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=8.48s)]
*  there on the runway. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=11.4s)]
*  They would have collided. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=12.56s)]
*  It comes just a day after another flight had to make [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=13.96s)]
*  an emergency landing when the cabin appeared [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=16.68s)]
*  to fill with smoke. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=19.32s)]
*  And beyond that, a series of significant and some fatal [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=20.56s)]
*  incidents in just the last month, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=23.64s)]
*  starting with the passenger jet and the Army helicopter crash [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=25.44s)]
*  that killed 67 people in D.C. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=28.76s)]
*  National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  Homidy joins us now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Jennifer, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=35.92s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=38.32s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  First of all, let's talk about what we saw yesterday, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  where that Southwest plane is trying to land. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=42.24s)]
*  Thankfully, the pilots were aware they saw that private [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=44.92s)]
*  plane. Why was that private plane on that runway? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that is actually one of our questions for this [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=51.32s)]
*  investigation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=55.2s)]
*  We don't believe that this was an air traffic control issue. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=57.08s)]
*  It appears this was a failure of the flight crew from FlexJet [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=61.72s)]
*  to listen and abide by the instructions of air traffic [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=68.4s)]
*  control. They were supposed to line up and wait and hold short [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=73.08s)]
*  of runway three one C, which Southwest was landing on, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=77.08s)]
*  and they failed to do so. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=80.32s)]
*  Well, so what happens? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=81.92s)]
*  What happened? The pilot is scolded. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=83.24s)]
*  What happens? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=85.08s)]
*  Well, we still have to conduct our investigation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=86.8s)]
*  We have a lot of information we still have to collect. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=89.2s)]
*  We want to know what was going on in the cockpit of that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  airplane. We will collect air traffic control communications. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=94.2s)]
*  We have asked for the cockpit voice recorder and flight data [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=98.56s)]
*  recorder from FlexJet. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=101.88s)]
*  We've also asked for the flight data recorder from Southwest. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  We'll have to do some interviews, and that's part of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=106.96s)]
*  our investigative process. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=109.16s)]
*  So a lot more to come. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  So, Jennifer, a lot of people are feeling uneasy because we've [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  seen these stories over and over in the news and spring break [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=114.24s)]
*  is right around the corner. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=116.92s)]
*  What can you say to parents, to families, to reassurers? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  We're all safe. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I can empathize with the concern, but I can tell you [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=123.52s)]
*  aviation is incredibly safe. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=128.2s)]
*  We have seen a lot of tragedy recently. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  We have at the NTSB sounded the alarm bells for a few years, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=133.68s)]
*  but just taking midway, 22 million passengers flew out [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=138.28s)]
*  of midway in 2023 and landed safely at their destination. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=142.2s)]
*  So aviation is incredibly safe. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  I have flown a number of times over just the last few weeks from [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=149.56s)]
*  Alaska, Philadelphia, Savannah, Atlanta. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=154.2s)]
*  Now I'm in Tuscaloosa. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=157.64s)]
*  And so it is actually the biggest risk is getting in your car to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=159.48s)]
*  and from the airport, not on the plane. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, what can you tell us about air traffic control? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=168.2s)]
*  We've heard there aren't enough people manning the air traffic [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=170.12s)]
*  towers. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=172.76s)]
*  What's the latest on that? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=173.88s)]
*  Yeah, and this is actually something that Secretary Duffy [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=176.28s)]
*  has really taken very seriously and the administration has [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=179.6s)]
*  taken very seriously. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=182.6s)]
*  I'm very happy about that because over the last couple of years, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=184.28s)]
*  this is what I can tell you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=187.56s)]
*  The NTSB has sounded the alarm bells over and over again about [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=188.8s)]
*  the potential for catastrophe. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=194.6s)]
*  Last spring, I testified before Senate commerce that the Department [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=196.4s)]
*  of Transportation needed to take action. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  They needed to get beyond words, beyond safety forms, and that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=205.8s)]
*  didn't happen, and here we are today. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=209.12s)]
*  Secretary Duffy has stated that he's going to fix it and he's going [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=211.44000000000003s)]
*  to fix it fast. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  And I think he's a great safety partner and I look forward to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=216.52s)]
*  working with them. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=219.4s)]
*  Yeah, I don't care what they have to do. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=220.08s)]
*  Double their pay, hire the best people that are aware and alert to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=221.24s)]
*  keep all the passengers safe. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=224.52s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_KEncrXjw&t=227.68s)]
