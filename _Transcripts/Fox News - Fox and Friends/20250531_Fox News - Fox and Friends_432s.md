# Tulsi Gabbard on countering Chinese aggression with Asian allies
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc)
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth meeting with Vietnam's defense minister along with other [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=0.0s)]
*  Southeast Asian counterparts early this morning while overseas in Singapore. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=7.48s)]
*  Hegseth working with leaders at Asia's premier security conference to strengthen ties in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=12.4s)]
*  the face of Chinese aggression. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  We do not seek conflict with communist China. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=20.52s)]
*  We will not instigate nor seek to subjugate or humiliate China's behavior toward its neighbors [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=25.52s)]
*  and the world is a wake-up call. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=32.64s)]
*  Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is with Pete Hegseth at that critical summit [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=38.36s)]
*  and she joins us now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=42.72s)]
*  Good morning Tulsi, it's so great to have you on today. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=44.44s)]
*  Let's talk about this because what I loved about what I'm hearing out of this conference [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=48.96s)]
*  from you and from Pete is, hey, we're ready, we want peace, but we're going to do it through [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=53.12s)]
*  strength and sort of standing up to China but also calling on the Asian communities [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=58.32s)]
*  and the Asian leaders who are also going up against China to do their part. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  Give us more information of what you see going on there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=68.16s)]
*  Yeah, thanks Rachel. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=70.44s)]
*  It's great to join you here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=71.84s)]
*  Really the overarching message is very consistent with what President Trump has been speaking [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=73.36s)]
*  about throughout his administration and his term in office, which is that he wants to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=79.22s)]
*  be the president of peace and we see this evidence on many different fronts as he is [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=85.17999999999999s)]
*  leading negotiations towards peace agreements and that's no different here in the Indo-Pacific. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=89.14s)]
*  As you know, I grew up in the Pacific, I've been born and raised out here, Hawaii is my [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=94.78s)]
*  home and so I have a very unique and personal understanding of this region and how unique [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=99.98s)]
*  each of these countries are, the nuances that exist, the complexities of these relationships [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=107.38s)]
*  today specifically because of history and those relationships. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=112.78s)]
*  So being here at conferences like this at the Shangri-La Dialogue are absolutely critical [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=118.94s)]
*  as we look towards that objective of peace and stability because it opens the door for [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=123.38s)]
*  these one-on-one conversations with leaders from each of these different Indo-Pacific countries. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=129.38s)]
*  There are over 40 countries who are present here, over 500 people and that dialogue, that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=135.1s)]
*  diplomacy, that increasing of understanding between us as countries is what is essential [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=142.5s)]
*  towards making progress towards that peace and stability, reducing the likelihood of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  misunderstanding, miscalculation and decisions being made based on either bad information [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=153.66s)]
*  or really just not understanding, hey, what is the nuance that we need to see here that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=159.54s)]
*  we may not be catching through the headlines. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=163.82s)]
*  And that's really where, again, you go back to President John F. Kennedy's focus on [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=166.5s)]
*  diplomacy, you look at leaders, Ronald Reagan, those who have chosen diplomacy, chosen to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=170.66s)]
*  have these direct discussions again as President Trump is leading in many different regions [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=176.9s)]
*  of the world. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=180.94s)]
*  This is an opportunity for us to do that and what we are doing here in the Indo-Pacific [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=181.94s)]
*  region now. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=186.62s)]
*  Director Gabbard, it's Lucas Tomlinson here in New York. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=187.62s)]
*  I have a question. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=191.54000000000002s)]
*  You said the U.S. wants peace. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=192.54000000000002s)]
*  Do you think China wants peace? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=193.9s)]
*  China's made it very clear that they don't want war. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=197.66s)]
*  We have made it very clear that we don't want war. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=201.02s)]
*  And again, this is why times like this are so critical to be able to have direct engagement, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=204.18s)]
*  not only between the United States and China, but between the United States and Singapore, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=210.22s)]
*  Thailand, Vietnam, India, Cambodia, Malaysia, Brunei, all of these different countries who [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=215.02s)]
*  are the Indo-Pacific and many of whom have good relationships with China, good relationships [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  with the United States, economic relationships with China, economic relationships with the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=229.78s)]
*  United States. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=233.78s)]
*  And this is why this dialogue specifically, I have found to be very beneficial and very [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=235.34s)]
*  productive because it allows us to have this direct conversation, talk through these areas [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=241.02s)]
*  of shared interests, talk through areas where we may have some differences and better understand [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=247.94s)]
*  where we're coming from in the landscape that we are operating in. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=253.02s)]
*  The thing that I have found here over these last couple of days is we have far more in [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=257.1s)]
*  common interests more than we do differences. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=261.06s)]
*  We are talking about things like counter-narcotics. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=265.74s)]
*  We're talking about the continued threat of Islamist terrorism in many of our countries. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=269.18s)]
*  These are areas where we've had longstanding concerns that continue today and areas where [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=276.34s)]
*  we have the opportunity to be able to work together ultimately again towards that mutual [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=281.34s)]
*  shared interest, which is for our respective peoples, the ability to live in a peaceful, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=287.14s)]
*  prosperous and free society. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=291.5s)]
*  I want to change topics real quickly and get your response to this. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=293.26s)]
*  You're in the process of declassifying Biden administration documents that label COVID [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=297.3s)]
*  centers in the United States as possible domestic violent extremists. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=302.66s)]
*  Tell us why that's so important. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=307.78000000000003s)]
*  When we look back over these last four years and many of us have had direct experience [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=310.98s)]
*  with this, we look at the censorship of Americans, the undermining of our First Amendment [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=315.66s)]
*  rights, social media companies being used by the Biden administration to silence voices [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=320.42s)]
*  that were dissenting to disagreeing or criticizing some of the Biden administration's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=326.9s)]
*  policies. The documents that we are declassifying that we've just done three over these last [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=332.02s)]
*  couple of weeks really get to how they did what they did, the groundwork they laid out [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=338.14s)]
*  in ultimately labeling those who criticize the Biden administration's policies on everything [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  from COVID vaccine mandates to those criticizing the Biden administration's open borders as [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=349.34s)]
*  those who are likely to become domestic violent extremists and how they weaponize the national [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=354.98s)]
*  security state, the intelligence community, federal law enforcement against everyday Americans [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=362.58s)]
*  simply exercising our fundamental First Amendment rights guaranteed by the Constitution. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=368.34s)]
*  And so these documents really get towards what President Trump promised the American [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=374.26s)]
*  in maximum transparency and help us move towards that objective of accountability and bringing [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=378.97999999999996s)]
*  about an end to this, better understanding how they use the levers of government to weaponize [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=386.65999999999997s)]
*  against those who disagreed with the government's policies under the Biden administration really [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=394.65999999999997s)]
*  brings clarity to us being able to hold leaders accountable and not allow them to do this [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=400.26s)]
*  in the future again. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=405.38s)]
*  Well, thank you to President Trump's Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. Aloha. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=406.86s)]
*  Thank you. Aloha. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KMu4WAAHpc&t=412.74s)]
