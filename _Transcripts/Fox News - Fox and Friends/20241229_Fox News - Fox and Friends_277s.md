# ‘Fox & Friends’ spotlights the worst media lies of 2024
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8)
*  2024 was a wild political campaign year, especially from the mainstream media. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=0.0s)]
*  But what are the worst lies the media pushed for Democrats? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=5.28s)]
*  You're going to break it down with me is Fox News contributor Joe Concha. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=8.76s)]
*  Joe's written a column on this and Joe, quite honestly, we can fill this entire wall full [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=12.24s)]
*  of media lies from 2024. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  And even that probably wouldn't do it justice. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=17.72s)]
*  We could go to 10am Eastern time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=19.52s)]
*  We could do the next several hours on this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=21.0s)]
*  Let's hit some of the low lights if we will. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=23.6s)]
*  Let's start with this, Joe. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=26.72s)]
*  This is defending, I believe, Kamala Harris's various flip flops throughout the year. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=29.3s)]
*  Here is some of what we were treated to from Kamala Harris. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=36.06s)]
*  I think sometimes we're not honest with ourselves about, you know, a couple things. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=41.06s)]
*  First of all, we change our minds all the time based on information, based on where [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=45.3s)]
*  we're sitting. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=52.1s)]
*  I don't think that's a bad argument. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=53.1s)]
*  I think people have a sense of understanding of those values. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=54.1s)]
*  But to your point, it sounds like politics and people have a willingness to accept a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=56.18s)]
*  level of politics. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=60.74s)]
*  There is a baseline. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=61.74s)]
*  Immigration matters to her. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=62.74s)]
*  People are saying she's so to the left, she's so progressive, she's very central, she's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=64.7s)]
*  going to have a Republican in her cabinet. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=68.3s)]
*  Joe? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=70.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=71.94s)]
*  When a Republican flip flops, it's called a lie. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=72.94s)]
*  When a Democrat does it, it's called evolving. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=74.94s)]
*  It's called learning and growing up. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=77.68s)]
*  Look, these weren't lies. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=79.82s)]
*  They were invalid truths, right? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=82.78s)]
*  Actually those are the same thing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=84.42s)]
*  When Kamala Harris said that she opposed fracking, all offshore drilling, compared ICE to the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=85.62s)]
*  KKK, thought that, you know, those in prison who are here illegally should get sex changes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=91.02000000000001s)]
*  These are all on tape. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=96.30000000000001s)]
*  So when they say these things, well, you can't say, well, no, no, no, she's changed this [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  time. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=101.86000000000001s)]
*  She was never a centrist and no one bought it because Donald Trump won the popular vote [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=102.86000000000001s)]
*  and won every swing state. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=106.30000000000001s)]
*  Well, this is one of my favorites in that it was so nakedly obvious how much they were [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=107.66s)]
*  running cover for Democrats and specifically Joe Biden. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=112.66s)]
*  Joe, these are all the headlines that said Republicans were guilty of cheap fakes, suggesting [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=115.42s)]
*  as The Washington Post does here, cheap fake Biden videos enrapture the right wing media, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=120.7s)]
*  but they deeply mislead Joe. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=125.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=127.30000000000001s)]
*  Five words sum up this entire year from a media perspective. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=128.3s)]
*  Don't believe your lying eyes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=131.18s)]
*  So when Joe Biden is walking off stage and he's shaking hands with the air, or he doesn't [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  know how to get off stage, or he forgets the name of cabinet members, or he's literally [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=137.9s)]
*  saying that he had a conversation with those who deceased way back when, whether it's the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=142.46s)]
*  French president, German chancellor and so on. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=147.26s)]
*  We were told those actually are not real when again, it's on video. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=149.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=154.62s)]
*  Fortunately, we have X and X served as the ultimate fact checker whenever we were told [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=155.62s)]
*  by the media that videos that we saw actually were real. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=159.5s)]
*  And as you mentioned, our lying eyes, we saw the truth. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=162.5s)]
*  Precisely. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=165.57999999999998s)]
*  Despite the fact they continue to try to tell us that Joe Biden was fit for office. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=166.57999999999998s)]
*  That was another one of the big lies this year. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=170.9s)]
*  Here's how they told us that what we see is not what is real. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=173.26000000000002s)]
*  The gaffes and mixing up names. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=177.3s)]
*  I think for people who've been observing Joe Biden for a really long time, that's actually [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=181.82s)]
*  just normal Biden. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  He did show a little swagger. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  And I think that the swagger does kind of combat the age. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  He's showing, you know, I've got a lot of energy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  extremely accomplished, experienced and capable in every way that anyone would want if they're [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=193.14s)]
*  president. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=205.82s)]
*  It might be, Joe, one of the biggest deceptions of the last decade, perhaps more. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=206.82s)]
*  Oh, I'll say in modern presidential history, right, as far as this cover up, which wasn't [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=212.29999999999998s)]
*  much of a cover up because we've been talking about it on this network for years. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=216.77999999999997s)]
*  The most unintentionally hilarious part about all of it, however, is when we were told that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=220.38s)]
*  actually behind the scenes, Joe Biden is this physical and mental, you know, master class, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=224.54s)]
*  right? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=230.1s)]
*  In other words, he's Lamar Jackson meets Stephen Hawking. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=231.1s)]
*  He's doing quadratic equations. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=233.38s)]
*  He's telling you how the flux capacitor works and why 1.21 gigawatts is actually important. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=234.9s)]
*  All these things when we all again heard and saw what we did from this president, especially [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=238.74s)]
*  during that debate in Atlanta, when his brain basically turned apples. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=244.3s)]
*  Remember when he told Donald Trump that he could out drive him? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=247.46s)]
*  Yes, I'm waiting for that competition. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=249.82s)]
*  The Biden versus Trump driving contest. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=251.54s)]
*  Know what the best part about that was? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=253.5s)]
*  Trump, like, is called a fascist and everything and didn't get too upset about that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=254.98s)]
*  But then if you talk about golf and you're going to out drive him, then he got really [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=258.34s)]
*  angry. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=261.78s)]
*  So wait a minute, that won't stand. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=262.78s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=264.14s)]
*  Thank you, Joe. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=265.14s)]
*  All right, man. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNS_UmjKR8&t=266.14s)]
