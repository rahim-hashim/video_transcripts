# Leaked emails reveal CO authorities knew about migrant gang threat for nearly a year
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE)
*  An Aurora, Colorado councilwoman sounding the alarm with newly leaked emails suggesting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=0.0s)]
*  people within the Aurora Police Department knew about the migrant gang threat for months. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=5.12s)]
*  The councilwoman says an internal email went out last November saying, quote, TDA or Tren [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=10.76s)]
*  de Agua has decided to make Denver their headquarters due to sanctuary policies and location. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=16.64s)]
*  But nearly one year later, residents are being forced to leave their homes because of the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=22.44s)]
*  violence still happening in their town. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=26.0s)]
*  Former head of ICE's Denver region and Colorado congressional candidate for that district, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  John Frabicatore joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=33.96s)]
*  John, it's so great to have you on the show. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  This is infuriating. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=38.98s)]
*  And I can't imagine if I was one of the residents who was being told that no, TDA is not in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=39.98s)]
*  Denver, is not in Aurora, is not in Colorado, and finding out that there were emails and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=46.12s)]
*  the cops knew. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=51.8s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=53.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=54.84s)]
*  Good morning, Rachel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=55.84s)]
*  It's an absolute mess. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=56.84s)]
*  You know, Danielle Jerminski, the councilwoman here, she's been raising the alarm on this [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=59.0s)]
*  for about two or three months. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=62.52s)]
*  Those of us like myself, who have also been talking about this, have been saying that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=64.56s)]
*  Tren de Agua was here and leaders inside the community, the mayor, the city manager, the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=68.2s)]
*  Aurora City Police Department leadership has denied it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=73.0s)]
*  And now these emails come out and we're beginning to see exactly what they knew, at least for [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=76.22s)]
*  a year. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=80.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=81.88s)]
*  They're not the only ones who knew. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=82.88s)]
*  The federal government knew, DHS knew. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=83.88s)]
*  I've been talking all the time about Congressman Troy Nels, who wrote a letter to Alejandro [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=85.04s)]
*  Mayorkas from Homeland Security, you know, over two and a half years ago, saying, hey, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=90.2s)]
*  you guys know that these prisons are being, you know, these prisons are releasing prisoners [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=96.42s)]
*  who are in TDA. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=102.4s)]
*  And you're telling the border patrol, hey, look out for these guys, but you're not telling [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=104.84s)]
*  citizens that you know this is happening while the border is open. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=110.4s)]
*  So that's there's a lot of culpability to go around. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=114.24s)]
*  So what was your reaction, for example, when you heard Martha Raditz, when she was interviewing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  JD Vant saying, well, it's only a few apartment buildings. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=126.24s)]
*  You know, it was ridiculous to me because it should be zero apartment buildings. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=130.28s)]
*  We should have no Venezuelan gang members in the United States right now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=134.32s)]
*  And like you were mentioning, the vetting, the vetting is horrible. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=138.12s)]
*  We don't share criminal information with Venezuela. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=140.72s)]
*  The border patrol is simply doing an NCIC check. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=143.76s)]
*  They're not coming up with any criminal history on these guys and they're simply letting them [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=146.32s)]
*  into the U.S. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=149.44s)]
*  And now we see exactly what's happening here in Aurora, Colorado, where these guys are [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  extorting people. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  They're kidnapping. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  They just cut the fingers off of a man here in Aurora in an extortion attempt. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=156.44s)]
*  So you know, we have to put our foot down on this because the this gang needs to be [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=161.06s)]
*  stopped now before they get even stronger. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=165.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  We're also heading up all kinds of sex trafficking, including child sex trafficking. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=169.24s)]
*  And they're the leaders on that as well. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=174.44s)]
*  It's really great to have you on, John. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=177.24s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  Thanks for sounding the alarm on it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  And hopefully someone like you will get a leadership position to put an end to it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=186.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=187.0s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=188.0s)]
*  Have a good morning. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=189.0s)]
*  You got it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=190.0s)]
*  We also try it got a statement from the police and they said we must remember that police [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=191.0s)]
*  departments and the justice system as a whole must rely on admissible evidence, not hearsay [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=196.56s)]
*  rumors and fragments of information contrary to claims made on social media and by select [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=201.4s)]
*  news organizations, the city, including a PD. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=206.12s)]
*  The Aurora Police Department has remained consistent in responses on this matter. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgS6Jw92hjE&t=209.60000000000002s)]
