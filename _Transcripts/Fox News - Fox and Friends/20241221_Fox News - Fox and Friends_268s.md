*  of narrow it down to this focus? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=91.84s)]
*  Well, that's just Idaho common sense. Uh, you know, some of that over the years [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=95.84s)]

*  academic pressure. But that's what we are in Idaho. We're definitely a state [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=108.96s)]
*  where opportunity and freedom is above and beyond all. And we want all kids to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  have the best possible opportunity and we don't think anybody should put their [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=122.36s)]
*  thumb on the scales that people should work hard and have maximum opportunities. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=126.11999999999999s)]
*  Governor, do you have advice for any of the other states that may be looking at [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=131.88s)]
*  this? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=137.32s)]
*  Well, they the policy that you just had up on the screen is a good place to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=139.0s)]
*  start from. But you know, whether it's, uh, continuing to lower taxes, uh, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=143.72s)]
*  significant decreases in regulatory environment, all those things that have [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=150.02s)]
*  the people of Idaho hold dear, uh, is our things that other states and that's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=157.12s)]
*  frankly the reason that states like Idaho are growing rapidly and those [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=163.76s)]
*  other states are having a decrease in population and economic activity is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  because people want to work hard and and create good services that the world [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=173.84s)]
*  needs are coming to states like Idaho where they have maximum opportunity to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  succeed. And Governor, just in the last 30 seconds or so that we have, I kind [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=183.6s)]
*  of wanted to ask you, how did we get here? Why is the state of Idaho having [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=188.16s)]
*  to deal with something like this? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=192.48s)]
*  Well, it's kind of like the regulatory environment. Uh, government left [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=196.0s)]
*  unchecked will continue toe add layers of bureaucracy, and that's why we [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=201.7s)]
*  either eliminated or cut 95% of all our rules and along with that, decreased [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  taxes. And if you just look at the demographics, if you look at the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=214.6s)]
*  measurements success, it's states like Idaho that are growing and succeeding, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=219.6s)]
*  and it's the other states that are going the wrong direction. So we are very [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=225.16s)]
*  excited for the new Trump administration because four years ago we were working [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=229.0s)]
*  with them to help with the federal regulatory burden and we look forward to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgrLpIt4R4k&t=232.79999999999998s)]
