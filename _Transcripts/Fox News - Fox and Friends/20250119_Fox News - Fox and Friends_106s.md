*  Let's go back out to Griff Jenkins, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=0.0s)]
*  ahead of Trump's victory rally in DC today. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=2.4s)]
*  Hey, Griff. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=6.04s)]
*  Ainsley, we are still eight hours away from this rally [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=8.72s)]
*  that will feature President-Elect Trump, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=11.52s)]
*  Vice President-Elect Vance, along with Elon Musk. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=13.56s)]
*  We'll speak, but look at this crowd. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=17.16s)]
*  We're a block away from the front. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=18.52s)]
*  You can see this crowd is thousands going four blocks up here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=20.92s)]
*  Let's talk to some of the people here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=24.98s)]
*  What's your name and where are you from? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  I'm Nick from Minneapolis, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=27.48s)]
*  and I came out here to show we need to take America back [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=28.96s)]
*  and give the government back to the people, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=31.84s)]
*  not the bureaucrats in Washington. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=33.54s)]
*  And it's not that cold, Ainsley. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=35.24s)]
*  It's only about 38, 39 degrees out here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=36.88s)]
*  Are you happy you're not freezing? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=39.28s)]
*  Yeah, back home, I think it's like negative 10. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=41.2s)]
*  So this is a heat wave for me. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the beach later, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=45.32s)]
*  strip naked and go skinny dipping. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Oh, that sounds like fun. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=48.32s)]
*  Now look, you got the Garbage Man t-shirt on. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=49.28s)]
*  Did you know that the garbage truck [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=51.16s)]
*  is supposed to make an appearance here? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=53.18s)]
*  Are you excited for that? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=55.28s)]
*  Absolutely, and I was telling other people [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  when President Trump gets to planning his library, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=58.16s)]
*  we need to have the garbage truck in there, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=60.72s)]
*  and we need to have, like, you can make your own picture [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=62.48s)]
*  of him standing out there giving out the fries [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=65.06s)]
*  in the McDonald's window. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlARqlYK5mc&t=67.0s)]
