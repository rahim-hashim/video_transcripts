# Georgia on pace to smash turnout records
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg)
*  This is a jaw dropping number. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=0.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=6.8s)]
*  More than 3 million people have already voted in Georgia. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  That's over half of the state's registered voters. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=11.0s)]
*  And tomorrow Kamala Harris is going to make her seventh [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=14.6s)]
*  visit to the state that Joe Biden won by fewer than [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=17.04s)]
*  12,000 votes in 2020. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  It will be her final pitch to those battleground voters. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=22.84s)]
*  Box and Friends weekend co-host, Will Kane is live there [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=26.32s)]
*  with the governor of Georgia. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=29.76s)]
*  Come on in guys. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=32.04s)]
*  I do have governor Brian Kemp with me right now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=34.4s)]
*  Right before we went on air Steve, Brian said to me, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=37.44s)]
*  have you had a lot of conversations about Texas, Georgia [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=41.44s)]
*  yet this morning? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=43.6s)]
*  I'd say at least two dozen. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  It's about time. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=46.32s)]
*  I gotta go. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=47.32s)]
*  Everybody has felt the need to rub it in. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=49.56s)]
*  Yes, you guys beat Texas. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=51.64s)]
*  We're focused on Florida now though, right y'all? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=53.08s)]
*  Governor, that is an astounding number that Steve [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=57.88s)]
*  was just sharing with the audience. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=60.28s)]
*  I mean, one in two voters in Georgia [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  have already cast a ballot. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=62.56s)]
*  It's 3.6 million compared to 2.3 at this time in 2020. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=64.16s)]
*  What is different? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=69.2s)]
*  Why is this happening in Georgia? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=70.04s)]
*  Well, I think just a lot of enthusiasm. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=71.36s)]
*  We saw a lot of people vote in 2022 [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  and my reelection campaign, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=76.36s)]
*  cause we really worked that hard [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  cause we knew we had to reverse what we saw happen in 2020. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  I think our election security act gave people on our side [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=83.2s)]
*  a lot of confidence in the process. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=86.56s)]
*  And then also just messaging from the top on down [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  from former president Trump, the Republican party, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  Georgia Republican party, elected officials like myself, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=95.32s)]
*  candidates that are in swing districts. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  I mean, we had told people that we got to get the vote out. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=100.44s)]
*  And I believe the enthusiasm and energy is more on our side [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=103.6s)]
*  than theirs right now, at least in Georgia. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=107.52s)]
*  I wanna ask you about that election security act [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=109.72s)]
*  because it's a point of conversation [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  on both the left and the right. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=115.52s)]
*  First, Joe Biden said it would be, what do you call it? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=116.52s)]
*  Jim Eagle, something like that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=119.72s)]
*  Jim Crow on steroids, Jim Eagle and Jim Crow 2.0. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  And then he said it would suppress the vote. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=125.96s)]
*  The numbers don't suggest that's the case whatsoever. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=127.44s)]
*  No, they did every name in the book, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=129.68s)]
*  just like the deplorables and garbage and Jim Crow 2.0, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=132.6s)]
*  voter suppression and other things that Stacey Abrams [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=136.8s)]
*  and a lot of other political leaders on their side [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=139.6s)]
*  were saying lawsuits that we won every single one of them. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=142.48s)]
*  Because we knew what the truth was. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=145.52s)]
*  It's easy to vote and hard to cheat in Georgia. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=147.24s)]
*  And we had to fight in the courts. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=150.08s)]
*  We had to fight the media narrative on that from the left. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  We had to fight big corporations [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=155.52s)]
*  and of course, Major League Baseball. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  But also I think that's why our people have said, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=159.52s)]
*  you know, look, we're gonna stick it in your eye. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=161.68s)]
*  We're gonna go vote and we're gonna win this thing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=163.44s)]
*  Keep Georgia red like it should be. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, I forgot about all that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  Poor professor, Major League Baseball. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=169.16000000000003s)]
*  You had it from everywhere, Governor. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=171.16000000000003s)]
*  You're about to get it from the voters as well [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=172.68s)]
*  here in Georgia. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  Let's have a few questions for you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=175.04s)]
*  Let's start with Betsy over here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=176.72s)]
*  We've been talking about illegal immigration this morning. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=177.92s)]
*  It's important to a lot of people. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=179.6s)]
*  And Betsy, what was your question for the Governor? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=180.88s)]
*  So Lake and Riley was killed four and a half miles [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=182.84s)]
*  from my home. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=185.12s)]
*  So that's a major concern for me. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=185.96s)]
*  What do you need from the federal government [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=187.2s)]
*  to help protect citizens in Georgia? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=189.28s)]
*  Like I said before, secure the damn border. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=192.4s)]
*  I mean, it's not that hard. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  We've done it before. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=196.32s)]
*  That should not be a partisan issue. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, Kamala Harris is saying she supports that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  And the question is, why haven't they done that? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=203.68s)]
*  You know, it's been almost four years now. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  And so I think when you look back at the policies [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=208.0s)]
*  of former President Trump, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=210.32s)]
*  the folks who were in charge when he was in office, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=212.6s)]
*  the relationships that they had with the governors, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=214.72s)]
*  I mean, you had the border was secure. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=218.44s)]
*  The messaging was right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=221.32s)]
*  You didn't have things that like happened [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=222.96s)]
*  to Lake and Riley going on. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=225.4s)]
*  We were just visiting Marty and I [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  with a family in Camden County [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  that their 15 year old daughter and grandmother [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=230.2s)]
*  got killed by a drunk driver that was here illegally. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  And those things have happened all over the country. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  It's one reason that I think we're gonna win this election. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=239.56s)]
*  All right, let's talk to Todd down here, Governor. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=242.83999999999997s)]
*  Todd had a question about the economy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=244.76s)]
*  He wanted to ask you about one of the policies [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  put forward by President Trump. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=249.04s)]
*  Yep, just curious of your thoughts [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  about any continued or increased trade tariffs with China. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, I have a little bit of mixed feelings [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=255.72s)]
*  on across the board tariffs, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=258.56s)]
*  but look, I would much rather be dealing [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=260.84s)]
*  with the Trump administration, the Harris administration [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=264.0s)]
*  when it comes to anything on tax cuts, the economy, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=266.56s)]
*  and really how we figure our way out of 40 year high inflation [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=270.44s)]
*  that we've seen from Biden and Harris. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=274.88s)]
*  Because their policies quite honestly [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  have been picking winners and losers [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=278.68s)]
*  versus having a level playing field. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=281.24s)]
*  Donald Trump's policies in the past, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=284.68s)]
*  at least dealing with them during COVID and other things [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  where they just treated all the states the same, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=289.44s)]
*  they treated all the citizens the same, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=292.04s)]
*  and that's all people want. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=294.2s)]
*  They want a free market or at least a stable market. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=295.32s)]
*  And I do think there's places where, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=299.12s)]
*  like we need to take on China. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=301.2s)]
*  Our trade deficit with China is way out of balance [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  from where it should be. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=306.12s)]
*  So taking the fight on some of those issues [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=307.68s)]
*  or even just sending the signals [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  that you're gonna do that can be very effective. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=312.2s)]
*  Brian Amendigo asked me to ask about election fairness. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=315.36s)]
*  We talked about that a little bit earlier. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=317.88s)]
*  What has Georgia done to ensure election fairness? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=319.24s)]
*  I think we've talked about that a little bit. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=321.2s)]

*  Stay focused, let's get the vote out. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=345.24s)]
*  We gotta win, not only at the top of the ticket, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=347.68s)]
*  but all the way down. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=350.28s)]
*  I mean, our legislative majorities [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=351.84s)]
*  are at risk in the Georgia State House. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=354.96s)]
*  So we've gotta help at-risk legislators. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=357.08s)]

*  I think you're getting that turnout. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=366.0s)]
*  Incredible turnout here in Georgia. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=367.88s)]

*  until the race is over, not just for president, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiiHvDaLNsg&t=372.24s)]
