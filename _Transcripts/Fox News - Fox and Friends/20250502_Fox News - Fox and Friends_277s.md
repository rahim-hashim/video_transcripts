*  of their 2022, three years ago, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=4.74s)]
*  encounter with the alleged MS-13 gang member, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=7.12s)]
*  Kilmar Abrego-Garcia. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  Madeline Rivera joins us live with the details. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=11.44s)]
*  Good morning, Madeline. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=13.8s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=14.96s)]
*  Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers pulled [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=15.8s)]
*  Kilmar Abrego-Garcia over for speeding in November 2022. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=17.72s)]
*  There were eight other people in the car. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=22.12s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia told authorities they were traveling [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=24.28s)]
*  from Houston to Maryland for construction work, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=26.52s)]
*  but there was no luggage in the car [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=29.08s)]
*  and they all gave the same home address as Abrego-Garcia, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=30.48s)]
*  which led police to believe [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=33.36s)]
*  that this was a human trafficking incident. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=34.68s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia, however, was not charged. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=37.16s)]
*  Here's part of that interaction. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=39.48s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=42.12s)]
*  Good, and you? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=42.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=44.24s)]
*  Anything good? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  You've got a bunch of people here, don't you? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=46.4s)]
*  Just one for seat, yes. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  I got to go back to work. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  I ain't never seen a suburb of one with four rows of seats. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  You know what you got here, right? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  Uh, no. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=56.32s)]
*  He's hauling these people for money. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=58.04s)]
*  They don't have any luggage in there, right? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  And if you get them out, they're gonna have a toothpaste [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=64.2s)]
*  and they're gonna have toothbrushes in their pockets, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  I guarantee you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=69.2s)]
*  He's got $1,400 cash in his pocket in an envelope. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vazquez, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=74.36s)]
*  has defended her husband despite previously accusing him [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=76.56s)]
*  of domestic abuse. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=79.56s)]
*  The Trump administration has released [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=81.16s)]
*  a second domestic abuse filing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  Vazquez had filed it in August 2020 [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=85.04s)]
*  before the 2021 order that's already been revealed. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=87.48s)]
*  Vazquez tells Newsweek, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=91.32s)]
*  after the trauma of his time in ICE detention [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=92.48s)]
*  and the struggles we faced during the pandemic, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=94.84s)]
*  I sought a temporary protective order, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=97.2s)]
*  but through counseling and faith, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=99.52s)]
*  Kilmar and I healed, reunited as a stronger couple, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=101.08s)]
*  and now our family needs him home. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=104.36s)]
*  Homeland Security officials, meantime, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  say the incident shows they were right [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=108.6s)]
*  to deport Abrego-Garcia. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=110.6s)]
*  Lawrence Ainsley and Brian. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=112.32s)]
*  All right, thank you, Maddie. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=114.44000000000001s)]
*  They were absolutely right. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  But he showed up on a list of MS-13 in 2019. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=117.68s)]
*  If you look at the police report, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=121.84s)]
*  it's readily available, you could all find it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  They say that he was hanging out wearing the things, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  had the tattoos, MS-13, hanging out in the Home Depot [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=127.12s)]
*  where he was scooped up. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=130.08s)]
*  And then when he goes to a series of hearings, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=131.12s)]
*  they say he's on the deport list, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=133.12s)]
*  but he's able to stay there because the judge [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=135.08s)]
*  lets him stay while they consider what to do with him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=137.16s)]
*  So he's working here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  Evidently, in construction, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=140.84s)]
*  someone said he was in the Union, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=142.4s)]
*  but when it turns up, when we get ahold of that list, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=144.36s)]
*  when the government gets ahold of that list, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  after the Biden people let him stay there, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=149.4s)]
*  they said, this guy's gotta be deported. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=150.88000000000002s)]
*  He's gotta be sent out. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=152.52s)]
*  Well, a judge in one of the hearings says [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=153.8s)]
*  he's gonna be targeted by Barrio 18, a rival gang. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=155.4s)]
*  So sending him back to his country would be dangerous. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=159.28000000000003s)]
*  They sent him back to his country. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=163.0s)]
*  You know why? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  Because MS-13 has been locked up. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  Things have changed in El Salvador since 2019. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=166.84s)]
*  Well, and the rival gang has been decimated as well. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=169.56s)]
*  Also, look, I'm not gonna victim blame [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=172.6s)]
*  when it comes to the wife right there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=175.16s)]
*  We know a lot of victims defend the person [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=176.84s)]
*  that offend against them. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=180.44s)]
*  So I don't know what position is in, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  but I'm gonna tell you that the husband, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=184.04s)]
*  the old or the person that she had a relationship prior [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=185.88s)]
*  with the father of her other two children, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=189.2s)]
*  say this guy is a gang member [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=192.28s)]
*  and doesn't want his kids around this guy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=194.16s)]
*  So you got two federal judges that have said [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=197.04s)]
*  when he's tried to get his immigration status changed, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  saying he's a part of a gang. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  And then you got two affidavits that she signed under oath [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=205.68s)]
*  that said he's abused. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=209.28s)]
*  And she also said that she has photos and videos. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=210.12s)]
*  Yeah, and then she said he went to therapy [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=213.2s)]
*  and they're on a better path right now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=215.2s)]
*  Right, can you see therapy satisfying, deductible? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  By the way, the first story in the New York Times say [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=220.64s)]
*  about the Maryland man. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=222.2s)]
*  They tried to paint a sympathetic picture [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  of a 16 year old crossing the border, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=225.04s)]
*  trying to avoid MS, trying to avoid a barrio 18. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=227.2s)]
*  Let them, let them then, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=232.2s)]
*  because that message is not a winning message. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=233.84s)]
*  These Democrats need to get off of this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=235.62s)]
*  But if they're gonna continue to push these narratives, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=237.2s)]
*  this was one of the most important things [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=239.73999999999998s)]
*  to voters across the country, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=241.48s)]
*  then they're gonna continue to lose. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=242.92s)]
*  So just let them do that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  Everyone knows what the truth is. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=245.28s)]
*  Why are we fighting for some guy that two judges said [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=246.76s)]
*  that he was in MS-13 and he doesn't live here? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=249.66s)]
*  He lives, he came here illegally twice, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=252.48s)]
*  and then he's deported back to his own country. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=255.04s)]
*  Okay, that's normal. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=257.48s)]
*  That's what happens when you break the law. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=258.64s)]
*  So why are they fighting for this guy? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=260.8s)]
*  And his wife has accused him of beating her twice [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=262.88s)]
*  and they have children at home. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=265.4s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVVq1swORI&t=266.96s)]
