*  thousands to swarm dealerships after weeks of vandalism and violence targeting both the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=6.16s)]
*  cars and their drivers. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=11.06s)]
*  Our next guest is no stranger to the chaos. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  His Cybertruck was attacked while activists screamed at him during a Mardi Gras parade. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=16.32s)]

*  in their Mardi Gras parade by being marshal escorts. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=57.72s)]
*  So we escorted the marshals. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=63.48s)]

*  The Cybertruck is just the latest model of Tesla. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=74.88s)]

*  You know, the high energy plus positive to this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=163.56s)]
*  You know, the high energy plus positive to this. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=165.56s)]
*  So Josh, I'm assuming that when you decided to go [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=167.56s)]
*  to join this parade, you weren't making, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=169.56s)]
*  trying to make a political statement, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=171.56s)]
*  by doing it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=173.56s)]
*  You were just trying to be in a parade. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=175.56s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=177.56s)]
*  So, also important to note, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=179.56s)]
*  is this took place back in the beginning of March. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=181.56s)]
*  March 3rd. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=183.56s)]
*  on fire and all the craziness that ensued. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=185.56s)]
*  So no political statements whatsoever by any of the crew members. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=188.6s)]
*  Don't know the political, you know, leadings of anybody on the crew. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=192.12s)]
*  Of course, not that it matters because this is actual violence. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=194.12s)]
*  So damage was done to your truck. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=198.32s)]
*  Your wife got hit in the head. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=200.76s)]
*  You filed a police report. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=201.8s)]
*  You have some sense that police are tracking down. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=202.8s)]
*  May be able to, I mean, you look at that video, it looks like they ought to be able to identify [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=207.16s)]
*  some of these people. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=210.96s)]
*  Yeah, and we had we actually had a citizen that reached out when they saw the news last [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=212.84s)]
*  week when it hit federal or national news, they saw and reached out with an even better [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=217.36s)]
*  picture so they actually witnessed the whole thing, took pictures of the guy and interacted [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=222.36s)]
*  with him. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=227.52s)]
*  And she filed a police report the next day. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=228.52s)]
*  Still to this day hasn't heard back from the New Orleans PD. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=230.96s)]
*  But we passed that along to the case agent that has our case. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=234.56s)]
*  So we're talking today on a day where you have all these people who are talking about [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  doing this across across the country at dealerships. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=243.6s)]
*  What is your what is your what is your view of all that? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, we're completely fine with peaceful protesting. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=253.04s)]
*  And that's, you know, that's that's certainly a right we have as Americans. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=256.4s)]
*  And we're we're we're totally OK with that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=260.32s)]
*  As long as there's not violence, you know, it's fine to voice your opinion. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=262.12s)]
*  And we're fine with that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=266.44s)]
*  As long as they're not committing violence, we're actually at a a national Tesla meet. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=267.52s)]
*  We have an enthusiast group and we've had this plan for months since last year. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=271.84s)]
*  And it happened to fall on the same day. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=276.88s)]
*  So we got a little nervous and engaged the local authorities and some other security [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=278.4s)]
*  measures to make sure that we weren't going to be targeted by these groups. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=285.0s)]
*  So we feel pretty pretty good about it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=288.56s)]
*  But but yes, it's a scary time. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=291.64s)]
*  I'll be honest, Josh. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=294.08s)]
*  You're just listening to you right now makes me want to go out and buy a Tesla. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  And I might just do that just to sort of thumb my nose at these wacko people. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=298.88s)]
*  Thanks for joining. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n25COHjilS4&t=304.28000000000003s)]
