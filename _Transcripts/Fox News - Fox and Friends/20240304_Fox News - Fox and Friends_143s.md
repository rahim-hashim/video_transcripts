# Concerns of wider war rise as Israel boycotts cease-fire talks
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ)
*  Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Fox News alert that was Vice President Kamala Harris taking a very clear [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=10.96s)]
*  stance on Israel's war over the weekend calling for an immediate ceasefire as [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=15.14s)]
*  the country is reportedly boycotting Gaza ceasefire talks in Cairo. Trey [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Yngst is live in Tel Aviv with the latest Trey. Yeah Steve, good morning. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=25.16s)]
*  You might remember last week President Biden eating ice cream saying that he [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=30.52s)]
*  hoped for a ceasefire by Monday. Well, it's Monday and there's no ceasefire. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=34.08s)]
*  However, we do understand that there is a delegation of Hamas representatives in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=38.08s)]
*  Cairo. They arrived yesterday to continue those conversations. The [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=42.96s)]
*  Israeli team did not send their delegation. Now, before the meetings [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=47.04s)]
*  took place, thousands marched here in Israel calling for their loved ones and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  fellow citizens to be released. There are reportedly disagreements over what [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=54.96s)]
*  information Hamas is willing to provide. The Israelis are looking for a list of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  all hostages that are still alive. Egyptian state media said today that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=63.36s)]
*  significant progress has been made toward a ceasefire that would include a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=67.56s)]
*  six week pause in fighting and the release of some hostages. Israel will [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=71.18s)]
*  have to release Palestinian prisoners as part of any agreement. The [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=75.26s)]
*  conversations are taking place as the holy month of Ramadan is set to begin [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=78.62s)]
*  this weekend. The holiday has traditionally led to increased tension [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=82.68s)]
*  and escalation across the region. 150 days into the conflict between Israel [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  and Hamas pressure is mounting to get a deal in place. Israel is expected to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  enter Gaza's southernmost city of Rafa. If these negotiations fall apart over [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=95.28s)]
*  the weekend, the United States conducted air drops of aid into Gaza, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=100.4s)]
*  delivering 38,000 meals to Palestinians in need. Similar air drops are expected [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  to continue. There are a lot of moving parts in these conversations that are [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=108.68s)]
*  taking place in Cairo, namely concern that if they do not succeed, a broader [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=112.32s)]
*  war could erupt in the region. Remember, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=117.36s)]
*  is still involved in the fight. They killed at least one civilian along [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=121.08s)]
*  Israel's northern border earlier today. Steve, all right, Triang Slyv in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jx1Lv0wgQ&t=124.47999999999999s)]
