# Democrats want to shut down government to stop Musk, GOP lawmaker says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY)
*  A busy week on Capitol Hill as House Republicans plan to vote Tuesday on a new spending bill [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=0.0s)]
*  to avoid a government shutdown. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=5.12s)]
*  Without it, a shutdown is set for Friday, and Democrats seem dead set on forcing that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=7.12s)]
*  to happen. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=12.88s)]
*  GOP Congressman Chip Roy, who sits on the House Budget Committee, joins us now with [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=13.88s)]
*  more of what to expect. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=17.78s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us this morning, Congressman. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=19.36s)]
*  So first off, I'm delighted that you all have successfully set up and pointed, pinpointed [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=21.88s)]
*  the blame. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=28.8s)]
*  I would say Democrats should always be blamed for government shutdowns because they're always [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=29.8s)]
*  the worst when it comes to spending. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  But it does seem like a slightly different dynamic where you actually have Democrats [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=37.0s)]
*  like pounding the table saying, we're going to shut the government down. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=41.0s)]
*  I think that's great. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=43.88s)]
*  Yeah, Charlie, good morning. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=44.88s)]
*  Look, the president is absolutely correct. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=46.88s)]
*  We've had a number of good, solid and productive meetings with him over the last couple of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=49.72s)]
*  weeks. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=53.2s)]
*  What we've got is a bill that we're going to put forward. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=54.2s)]
*  I'm on the Rules Committee. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=55.72s)]
*  We'll vote on it on Monday, get it to the floor on Tuesday. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=56.72s)]
*  Let's keep in mind what's going on. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=59.76s)]
*  I'm no huge proponent of a CR, a continuing resolution as being the best model for how [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=61.32s)]
*  we fund the government. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=66.36s)]
*  But let's understand what we've been up against. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=67.36s)]
*  Democrats who didn't want to get the job done. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=69.8s)]
*  Now we have the chance to freeze spending at current levels. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=71.48s)]
*  No omnibus, no great big bloated bill with all the sort of pages we haven't read. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=74.68s)]
*  No earmarks, to the best of my knowledge. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=79.72s)]
*  We have defense spending that is up a little bit so that we can do what we need to do on [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=82.06s)]
*  defense. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=86.92s)]
*  We're going to put the line defense flat and basically an overall freeze. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  And here's the important part. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=90.72s)]
*  We're keeping the lights on for Elon to continue to do what they're doing with Doge, identify [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=92.2s)]
*  the spending cuts that we know we need to put in place in the appropriations bill this [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=97.76s)]
*  summer and importantly give time for Russ Vought at the Office of Management and Budget [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=102.08s)]
*  and the great team around President Trump to figure out how to get those implemented, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=107.12s)]
*  use impoundment and use the tools of the executive branch, which I think are fairly robust to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=111.8s)]
*  constrain spending. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=116.68s)]
*  This is a new world, a new dynamic. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=118.2s)]
*  And I think we can work with the president to do this while Democrats want to shut down [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=120.08s)]
*  because they want to stop Elon. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=124.32s)]
*  So one of my shotgun approaches to understanding a bill is how long it is. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=126.08s)]
*  And this one's just 99 pages. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=131.04s)]
*  I think everybody can read that before they get to it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=133.2s)]
*  But lay out for us exactly how you think the GOP conference is going about it right now. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=135.56s)]
*  Do you feel like you all are going to get this done? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=143.68s)]
*  You don't have much room to play with. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=146.32s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, we had a good conversation yesterday as a conference with the speaker. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  There is overwhelming support for the bill. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=154.52s)]
*  There are still a few folks who don't like it, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=156.8s)]
*  They are predisposed against the so-called continuing resolution. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=159.52s)]
*  And look, Charlie, I'm predisposed against having those kinds of tools as well. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=163.4s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we need to support the president to be able to move the ball [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=168.2s)]
*  forward with a freeze in spending. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  I think that's the right approach. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=173.48s)]
*  There are a handful of my probably more conservative colleagues who are a little suspect. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=174.96s)]
*  And I think as we walk through it and they understand that a spending freeze is always [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  a really good win and then identify the cuts that we can then leverage in the FY26 [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  appropriations process, that's all inside Beltway speak for the average viewer at home. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=189.8s)]
*  Freezing spending is good. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=194.8s)]
*  Holding defense in place so that we can remodernize our military is good. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=196.52s)]
*  Stopping Democrats is good. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  No earmarks is good. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  And let's actually give Elon more power. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=204.6s)]
*  Again, Democrats desperately want to turn the lights off to stop Elon and Doge because [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  they know the American people are now getting a glimpse under the hood. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=212.52s)]
*  Well, and as you say, you always have been a real hawk on these things and we're grateful [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=215.96s)]
*  to you for that. What is it? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=220.96s)]
*  How are how would you say the effort within Congress is going right now to try to sort [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=223.12s)]
*  of work hand, you know, not only confirm the things that President Trump wants to do, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  but actually sort of take a stronger hand and help guide some of this so that what you [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=235.44s)]
*  wind up with is legislation created by Congress that actually makes sure that the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=241.48s)]
*  spending doesn't get back out of hand as soon as the Trump administration is finished [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=249.28s)]
*  doing its work. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, what you just said is critical. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=256.44s)]
*  We need permanent changes. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=258.28s)]
*  Congress needs to act so that this can last beyond President Trump. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  Right. We love what President Trump is doing, but we need structural reforms. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=263.47999999999996s)]
*  And look, I'm proud to be working closely with the White House on this. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  We were able to get this, I think, package put together and we'll hopefully deliver this [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=270.35999999999996s)]
*  week. We'll see. There's still some more work to do. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=274.44s)]
*  I want to be very clear. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=276.44s)]
*  But then we also were successful in moving the budget resolution through the House, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=277.88s)]
*  which significantly reduces spending by two trillion dollars and connects that reduction [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=281.96s)]
*  to the tax policies, which I think is an important connection. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=287.08s)]
*  We were working together with the White House, working together as a conference because [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=290.12s)]
*  we need those permanent changes so that we can actually deliver for the American people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=293.56s)]
*  And we got to prevent a future Biden from being able to do what they did to destroy [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  this country. Because they'll always go back to it as soon as you as soon as you walk [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  away, they'll always go back to it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=306.96s)]
*  Congressman Chip Roy, thank you for joining us. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=308.88s)]
*  Charlie, God bless you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=311.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLCMSqzDULY&t=317.08s)]
