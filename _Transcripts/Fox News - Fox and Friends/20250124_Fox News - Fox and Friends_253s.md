# Trump doubles down on retaking Panama Canal: 'You're serious?'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE)
*  Missouri Senator Eric Schmidt is introducing a first of its kind resolution [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=0.0s)]
*  calling on Panama to cut ties with Hong Kong based companies that run several [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=4.44s)]
*  ports in the Panama Canal. It also proposes a US Panama Task Force for [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=8.88s)]
*  canal security and operational management and comes as President Trump [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=13.92s)]
*  continues the push to take it back. The most expensive thing relatively space [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=18.88s)]
*  the most expensive thing we've ever built is the Panama Canal. And you're [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=24.6s)]
*  unfortunately Jimmy Carter gave it away for $1. Oh no we're gonna have to take it [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=28.84s)]
*  back. China is running the Panama Canal right now that wasn't the deal. Here to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=33.32s)]
*  discuss is the Missouri Senator Eric Schmidt. Good morning to you Senator. Good [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=38.84s)]
*  morning Ainsley. Good morning. Tell me about this resolution and what your [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=42.44s)]
*  desires are. Yeah look I mean President Trump has outlined this recently but [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=45.72s)]
*  this has been a concern for a while and that China effectively has control the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=49.44s)]
*  Panama Canal. They control ports on either end. Why is that important? Because [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  most of the goods and services are most of the goods that we transport to the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=56.92s)]
*  Pacific that go through the Panama Canal. Our Navy goes through the Panama [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=59.84s)]
*  Canal. When we foolishly gave it away the one condition that was insisted upon [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=63.88s)]
*  is that the canal will remain neutral. It's not neutral anymore. It's part of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  China's Belt and Road Initiative where they buy up ports, they build airports [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=71.68s)]
*  and if you criticize the CCP you may not get flights anymore. They build [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=75.68s)]
*  infrastructure that they can turn it on and they can turn it off. We simply from [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=79.6s)]
*  a national security perspective cannot have that situation with regard to the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=83.56s)]
*  Panama Canal. Our Navy as I said goes through there so President Trump spoke [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=87.28s)]
*  very clearly about this and I think the United States Senate who entered you [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  know into that agreement and essentially gave the Panama Canal back through that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=94.68s)]
*  treaty to Panama the United States Senate now needs to speak very clearly [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=98.8s)]
*  on this. Yes so the president of Panama says it belongs to Panama. Is the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=102.88s)]
*  president just trying to put pressure on them to cut ties with China or will he [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  really take it back and if he wants to or he decides to how can he do that? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=110.84s)]
*  Well I think all options are on the table but one thing is very clear and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=114.8s)]
*  what this resolution calls for is they need to expel all of the Chinese [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=118.56s)]
*  influence and companies that currently have operational control of that canal. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=123.12s)]
*  Like I said they control ports on either end of the canal. If they wanted to I [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  mean first of all there's a lot of surveillance concerns right now with our [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=133.08s)]
*  Navy passing through there. China being able to sort of know where we're at all [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=137.0s)]
*  the time there's a lot of risk there if they wanted it for sabotage or whatever [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=140.68s)]
*  the Chinese wanted to do if we you know we're in easy I think it's important to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=145.24s)]
*  understand we are in a globe we are in a competition with China right now. Who's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=149.6s)]
*  gonna win the 21st century? China has aims on being the dominant world power [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=153.96s)]
*  supplanting the United States of America. They're playing the long game. They built [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=159.28s)]
*  islands in the South China Sea. They're buying up ports all you know around the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=163.08s)]
*  world. They simply cannot have control the Panama Canal so they just need to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=166.96s)]
*  expel the Chinese influence from the Panama Canal get it back to where it [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  should be which is neutral and I think that's what the president's talking [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=174.28s)]
*  about. How does this affect the American family? Well look our goods you know [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=177.72s)]
*  everything would get more expensive if China you know really wanted to exert [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=182.4s)]
*  maximum control here but I think from a national security perspective that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  certainly as a member of the Armed Services Committee where I'm coming at [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=189.68s)]
*  here our ability to move ships from here to there they go through the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=193.08s)]
*  Panama Canal so for American families that are out there that want to know [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=197.8s)]
*  that they're safe and that their military can protect them for you know [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  a power that has designs on world domination the canal is an integral part [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  to all that and it must be neutral and I think that's why this resolution is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=209.52s)]
*  important. Yeah so are you getting bipartisan support because it seems [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  like a no-brainer to it should be a no-brainer for every American. I hope so [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=215.96s)]
*  We just introduced it yesterday I hope this is something that Republicans and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=219.92s)]
*  Democrats can come together as Americans I think this is an issue this isn't [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=224.16s)]
*  partisan this is about our national security it's also by the way about 78 [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=227.68s)]
*  percent of the the the goods that flow through the canal are from American [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  ships and so this is a big deal for the United States of America. Absolutely [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=235.88s)]
*  Senator thank you so much. Good to be with you. Good to be with you. I'm Steve [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPMbH_DgeE&t=239.32s)]
