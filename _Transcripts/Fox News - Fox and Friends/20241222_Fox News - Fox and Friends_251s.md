# Drinking and smoking among teens drops, but this surprising vice is on the uptick
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0)
*  The FDA is redefining healthy foods within the next two months as more than 75% of Americans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=0.0s)]
*  have diets low in vegetables, fruit and dairy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  In order to meet the new criteria, a product must contain a certain amount of fruit, vegetables, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=9.6s)]
*  grains, fat-free or low-fat, dairy or protein. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=15.4s)]
*  It must also meet specific limits for added sugars, saturated fats and sodium. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=18.64s)]
*  Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Safar joining us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=24.2s)]
*  Nicole, Merry Christmas. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=27.92s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=29.44s)]
*  What do you make of this new FDA regulation? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=31.16s)]
*  Well, Merry Christmas, Griff. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=37.2s)]
*  This is something you and I have been talking about for years when it comes to fats. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=38.2s)]
*  This is breaking news for the FDA to finally update their nutritional recommendations. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=41.44s)]
*  It's been over three decades since they were made. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=45.84s)]
*  You think science may have evolved since then. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=48.36s)]
*  But the good news is if anybody has been watching Fox and Friends for the last decade, you've [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=50.88s)]
*  heard me talk about the fact that not all fats are created equal, especially the poly [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=54.2s)]
*  unsaturated fats. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=58.6s)]
*  That's where you find your omega-3s, your omega-6s in salmon, legumes and certain nuts. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=59.88s)]
*  These are great for your heart health, your eye health and your brain health. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=65.28s)]
*  And so I've always been encouraging this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=68.72s)]
*  And finally, the FDA has said, we're going to start looking at the data that shows how [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=70.68s)]
*  beneficial it is. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=75.0s)]
*  They're also going, they're also talking about saturated fats, which you find in your [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=76.44s)]
*  animal products, your meat, your dairy, and they're separating those from your trans fats. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=80.64s)]
*  That's what you find in your processed foods. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=86.0s)]
*  And we know that those are bad for you. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=89.44s)]
*  There's no way, shape or form that that's actually healthy for you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=90.44s)]
*  So what they're wanting to show is if you're going to label something as healthy, they [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=93.16s)]
*  have to make sure that they really are healthy for you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=96.84s)]
*  They're also saying it has to be limited how much sugar is added because you can get great [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  yogurt, but sometimes they add so much sugar to it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=103.44s)]
*  It's not healthy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=106.48s)]
*  Now, Griff, I have to criticize the FDA. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=107.48s)]
*  They started these conversations almost a decade ago. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=109.84s)]
*  The data started coming out showing the difference in fats in the early 2000s, even 1999. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=112.84s)]
*  Emerging data showed the benefits of some of these fats. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  It has taken them almost a year to make these recommendations. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=122.36000000000001s)]
*  And one of the other goals that they have is they want to have a little symbol to put [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=125.76s)]
*  on packaging so it's easy to recognize something that is healthy versus not healthy. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, they started that conversation in 2021 and they still don't have that symbol and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=133.24s)]
*  there is no date to when they will have that symbol. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=137.96s)]
*  So the lack of efficiency and just the delay by the FDA has caused a massive trail of preventable [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=140.86s)]
*  illness in its wake. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=146.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=147.96s)]
*  And it is a recommendation, not a regulation. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=148.96s)]
*  I misspoke there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=151.04s)]
*  Let me just quickly before I run out of time, Nicole, this really caught my eye. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=152.26s)]
*  It's a survey revealing that over two thirds of U.S. teens don't drink, smoke or use marijuana, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=155.92s)]
*  but nicotine pouches like Zen that we've all seen in those tin cans are gaining ground. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=162.28s)]
*  In fact, it's like 6% of 12th graders up 3%, 3% of 10th graders using the pouches. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=168.88s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=175.52s)]
*  Great news. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  The fact that kids are finally learning you shouldn't be inhaling anything. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  It's terrible for you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=182.0s)]
*  It can cause everlasting life lung disease. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=183.0s)]
*  However, you know, the emergence of Zen, I do have some concerns for it, especially [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=185.56s)]
*  when it comes to adolescents, because nicotine is something that can affect brain development. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=189.68s)]
*  You can see increased ADHD, impulsivity and other things, eating disorders. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  And also on top of it, by using Zen or nicotine like products, you are increasing the risk [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=199.44s)]
*  for addiction. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=204.76s)]
*  And once they're addicted to nicotine, the likelihood of them being addicted to something [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=205.76s)]
*  else in the future is higher. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=209.0s)]
*  So I personally am a little concerned about the overuse of nicotine products as well as [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=210.83999999999997s)]
*  social media in our adolescents. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  That is another form of addiction in itself, and it all is going to be affecting their [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=216.6s)]
*  brain development and mental health. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=219.72s)]
*  And we'll see with the incoming Trump administration whether there's a further debate on that addiction [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  to social media. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=228.2s)]
*  Tick tock. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=229.6s)]
*  The court's about to take up arguments over whether or not they might be banned in the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=230.6s)]
*  U.S. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=234.64s)]
*  Dr. Nicole Sapphire, Merry Christmas to you and your family. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=235.64s)]
*  Thanks for the insight, as always. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=237.72s)]
*  See you soon, Greg. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gpOEWZtwt0&t=240.32s)]
