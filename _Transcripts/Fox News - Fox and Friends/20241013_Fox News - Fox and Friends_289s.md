# ‘PROTECT AND PRESERVE’: 15 Medal of Honor recipients endorse Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI)
*  More than a dozen Medal of Honor recipients making a huge endorsement ahead of Election [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=0.0s)]
*  Day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  In a signed letter, they write, quote, We believe the United States of America is the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  greatest nation the world has ever imagined. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=9.36s)]
*  We believe in mutually pledging to every American our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=12.24s)]
*  And we believe in Donald Trump. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=17.44s)]
*  One of those heroes includes our next guest, who was awarded the Medal of Honor by President [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=20.72s)]
*  Trump in 2019. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=24.72s)]
*  Staff Sergeant David Bellavia joins us now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=27.0s)]
*  David, great to see you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=30.56s)]
*  Why the letter? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=32.56s)]
*  You know, it's you and others who have bestowed the medal, you know, take great care in preserving [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=33.56s)]
*  that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=39.84s)]
*  You don't wield it without intentionality. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  In this case, you're saying, hey, we're coming together to support Donald Trump. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=47.44s)]
*  Well, look, we believe that being a citizen is kind of a big deal. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=48.44s)]
*  People like you, like myself and so many other millions of Americans decided that we love [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=54.88s)]
*  being citizens so much that we are willing to risk our life and bleed for this country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=61.42s)]
*  This flag is important to us. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=66.52s)]
*  The values of American are important to us. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=68.34s)]
*  And moreover, enemies of the United States should be destroyed. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=70.48s)]
*  We're trying to protect and preserve this country. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=75.28s)]
*  I can't believe we're having this conversation on TV right now, that we have to delineate [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=77.88s)]
*  ourselves from the other side. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  It's not just that President, former President Trump believes in those values, and as recipients, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=87.08s)]
*  we believe in those values as well. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  But I'm afraid that President Trump's opponent is against us and those values. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=95.24s)]
*  That's what's disturbing to me, is that in this choice for president, we have one side [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=100.72s)]
*  that is still willing to negotiate with Iran, that is telling our partners and our coalition [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=106.64s)]
*  allies to hold back against fighting and defending their sovereignty and their way of life. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=112.84s)]
*  It's a troubling time, but to me, it's the most simplistic decision I've ever made in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=121.16s)]
*  my life. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=124.88s)]
*  What would a Kamala Harris presidency mean for the military? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=127.0s)]
*  We've had a terrible recruiting crisis. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=130.08s)]
*  The morale is down. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=132.44s)]
*  We know that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=133.44s)]
*  We've been a part of talking to a lot of guys and gals. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=134.76s)]
*  What would it mean if she were to win? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=136.92s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, confidence in our military is at a 20-year low. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=141.0s)]
*  Recruiting is cratering across the board. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=145.72s)]
*  More importantly, I mean, look at our embassy closures. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that used to be a shock when we put out the message that we're shuttering an embassy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=150.8s)]
*  Now that seems to be par for the course. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=156.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=158.88s)]
*  This last four years has been a rough four years that I don't want to do again. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=159.88s)]
*  I'm just afraid what the future looks like. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=163.04s)]
*  But here's the great thing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=165.92s)]
*  I know what President Trump's administration looked like. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=166.92s)]
*  I know the swagger that we had. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=169.64s)]
*  That military was rebuilt and ISIS ran for the hills in Aleppo. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=171.88s)]
*  That was a special time to be in the service of being part of the military. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=178.64s)]
*  What was it about that moment in time? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=181.16s)]
*  Because you know, Donald Trump famously says, hey, I don't want to start new wars. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=182.96s)]
*  I want to finish them. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  In the case of ISIS, we were told this problem is going to last forever, yet in pretty short [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=187.28s)]
*  order, Donald Trump tactically and operationally defeated ISIS. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=192.24s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  Why was it different when he was in charge? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, clearly, one of the things that people don't want to talk about with ISIS [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=201.56s)]
*  is the Soleimani hit. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  Just think about what's happening right now in the Middle East. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=208.44s)]
*  How does this look differently with Soleimani running Quds forces and the Iranian Revolutionary [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=211.8s)]
*  Guard? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=217.24s)]
*  We've got an education on Iran's relationship with Hamas and Hezbollah after October 7th [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=218.24s)]
*  of 2023. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=224.12s)]
*  But Pete, for guys like you and me, we know that Iran has killed our friends. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=225.12s)]
*  We know that that technology in Afghanistan and in Iraq came from Iran. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=230.36s)]
*  And remember, when Soleimani was killed by the Trump administration, you still had members, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  some of them running for president of the United States, that were against the attack [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  to take Soleimani out. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=245.32000000000002s)]
*  I mean, if we're splitting hairs on Quds forces, Iranian Revolutionary Guard, we've got major [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=247.0s)]
*  problems on how we see the world. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=251.88s)]
*  God bless the other side. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=254.2s)]
*  I just don't want you anywhere near power, and I don't want you making controls over [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=255.4s)]
*  our sons and daughters. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=259.12s)]
*  And you wear that medal on behalf of a generation. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=261.92s)]
*  The only living recipient of the Medal of Honor for the Iraq War took years for it to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=264.64s)]
*  be bestowed on you, and you've done right by it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=268.28s)]
*  And I appreciate the way in which you've thoughtfully gone, laid out who you support for commander [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=271.94s)]
*  in chief, Staff Sergeant Belavia. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=276.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZDNsumvDI&t=278.24s)]
