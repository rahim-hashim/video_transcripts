# Israel launches strike in Lebanon, claiming Hezbollah violated ceasefire deal
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM)
*  Israel's ceasefire with Hezbollah, potentially in jeopardy, less than 48 hours after it was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=0.0s)]
*  announced. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Lebanon says two are hurt after Israeli forces launched a strike on a number of southern [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  towns. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=11.76s)]
*  This is in response to what Israel says were actions that violated the truce. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=12.76s)]
*  Here with the reaction of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=16.52s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=19.72s)]
*  We look at this and we say you can't make it two days in a ceasefire. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=22.32s)]
*  This is not going in the right direction. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  What are your thoughts on it? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=28.52s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me on. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=29.52s)]
*  Look, I'm unsurprised that the ceasefire hasn't held even for just a couple days. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  This conflict's been going on a long time. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=37.44s)]
*  Hezbollah didn't agree as part of the ceasefire to give up their goal. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=40.08s)]
*  Their goal is the destruction of Israel. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=45.72s)]
*  It was almost certain that their intention would be to go continue this conflict. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=46.72s)]
*  That's what we, I think, have seen. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=50.32s)]
*  I hope it gets back to a more peaceful situation so these Israeli citizens that live in the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=51.92s)]
*  part of Israel can get back home. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=57.48s)]
*  But I'm also confident that the Israeli Defense Forces know this as much as I do. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=58.76s)]
*  They're going to do the things that are necessary to protect the Israeli people. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=62.64s)]
*  But for the United States to have put this pressure on Israel to have signed this deal, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=66.32s)]
*  which almost certainly will prove not constructive in actually continuing to allow the Israelis [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=70.24s)]
*  to do what they need to take down Hezbollah, lock, stock and barrel. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=77.44s)]
*  I regret that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=81.6s)]
*  And I'm unsurprised by what we've seen in the last 48 hours. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=83.08s)]
*  I expect you'll continue to see this kind of conflict. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=85.68s)]
*  Yeah, you really kind of answered my next question, which is where is this pressure [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=87.8s)]
*  for a ceasefire coming from? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=91.48s)]
*  And it seems like the Biden administration, maybe they're trying to claim a small victory [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=92.88s)]
*  before he gets out of office. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=96.48s)]
*  Maybe it's a genuine attempt to calm what is turning into a multi-front war. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=98.02s)]
*  Where is the Biden administration as opposed to what the incoming Trump administration [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=103.32s)]
*  on this conflict in Israel? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=107.32s)]
*  Hey, Kevin, I think everyone's playing to the Trump administration now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=109.92s)]
*  I think both sides were entered into the ceasefire with some idea of what's coming [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=114.28s)]
*  next from President Trump, which will be enormous pressure on the Iranian regime. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=120.0s)]
*  Iranian regime, rather. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=125.04s)]
*  That's the difference. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=126.76s)]
*  The Biden administration has been trying to get the Israelis to stop defending themselves [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=127.76s)]
*  for now over a year. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=132.08s)]
*  There are still hostages, American hostages even, Kevin, held in Gaza by the Iranians [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=134.12s)]
*  today. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=138.6s)]
*  They're proxy Hamas, holding them directly. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=139.6s)]
*  The ceasefire in the north is the Biden administration's last dish of temper to say, see, look, we [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  did something. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=146.84s)]
*  We solved a problem, frankly, a problem that they created the conditions for, sort of like [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=147.84s)]
*  the arsonists putting the fire out. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=152.56s)]
*  But make no mistake about it, the conditions haven't changed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  The Iranians are still trying to destroy Israel and the United States of America. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=157.96s)]
*  This is about one small front in a bigger conflict, which will require the United States [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  to support the Israelis in their efforts to diminish Iran's capacity to commit terror [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=166.96s)]
*  around the world. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  That's what this is really about, Kevin. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, what's happening in the Middle East is not even the only war that we're worried [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=174.72s)]
*  about. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=179.12s)]
*  Obviously, what's happening in Ukraine is potentially a much larger concern. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=180.12s)]
*  This is President Putin talking about the Biden administration and the incoming Trump [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=182.88s)]
*  administration. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=187.4s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=188.4s)]
*  It's possible that the current administration wants to create difficulties for the future [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=189.4s)]
*  administration. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=195.24s)]
*  That is also a possibility. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=196.44000000000003s)]
*  But in my view of the newly elected president, he's quite a clever and experienced man. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  I think he will find a solution given that he has tackled such a challenge as reclaiming [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=202.44000000000003s)]
*  the White House. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=206.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=207.52s)]
*  Take the partisan politics out, right? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=208.52s)]
*  The left will say, well, that's proof that they're cozying up and things like that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=209.84s)]
*  If we just look at what's happening, so Ukraine uses American-made missiles further into Russia [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  than previously thought they would or could or were allowed to. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=218.36s)]
*  In return, Russia fires back. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  My question is, is there any chance that President Zelensky is trying to bait the U.S. into this [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=223.64s)]
*  war before Biden leaves office? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=228.76s)]
*  Oh, I don't think that's likely. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=232.88s)]
*  I think what's really happening is both leaders, President Zelensky and Putin, are both trying [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=235.32s)]
*  to create the conditions where they have more leverage as these negotiations begin, as this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=241.16s)]
*  conversation frankly has already started. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  President Biden is largely irrelevant to this conflict in Europe today. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=248.48s)]
*  It's already President-elect, former President Trump, who is driving the process there in [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=252.32s)]
*  Europe. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  I think they're both trying to gain leverage. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  They're both trying to be in a better position when the conversations begin about how to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  create peace there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=262.56s)]
*  They know that during the four years where I was in office and President Trump was in [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=264.08s)]
*  charge, they know that we had created a deterrence model that had actually worked for the Ukrainian [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=273.64s)]
*  We didn't have Ukrainians being killed every day. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=274.64s)]
*  We didn't have what you've seen in the last 48 hours, massive missile attacks on the Ukrainian [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=276.32s)]
*  energy infrastructure. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=280.76s)]
*  They know this is the new sheriff coming back and they're both trying to get in a better [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=282.64s)]
*  spot to get a better outcome when that happens. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, President Trump said he might could solve these conflicts even before he gets [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=288.08s)]
*  into office. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=291.28s)]
*  I hope and pray he does. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=292.28s)]
*  Secretary Mike Pompeo, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=294.12s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmfUSZihDM&t=297.34s)]
