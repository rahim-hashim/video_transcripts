*  A little bit of turtle soup for everybody that's visiting Louisiana right now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=16.84s)]
*  Big old snapping turtles. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  He was talking to us about how you cook and catch those snapping turtles, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=21.32s)]
*  prepare them. It's what you got to do when you're in Louisiana. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=24.72s)]
*  You got to lean in. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=27.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely. It's a delicacy out here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=28.18s)]
*  You know, yeah, yes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=30.78s)]
*  When you get that's a special event when you get that turtle at the table. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=32.36s)]
*  I didn't know was snapping turtles. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=35.86s)]
*  Yes, snapping yellow, yellow, yellow bellies. Yes. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=37.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah, we got plenty, plenty of them. They great. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=40.06s)]
*  Everybody comes here for the party, the food, the drinks, the atmosphere. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=42.56s)]
*  And you got to have a little turtle soup for you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=46.16s)]
*  Little turtle soup. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  They were just talking about as we were coming in, Governor, the the security. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=49.5s)]
*  So this has been obviously multi-year process bringing the Super Bowl. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=53.1s)]
*  You've been in office a little over a year here in Louisiana. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=56.66s)]
*  And we know what happened, you know, roughly a month ago here in New Orleans. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  Tell us about all the preparations on the security side. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=63.5s)]
*  Well, you know, when you think about it, three years ago, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=66.2s)]
*  this city was one of the most dangerous cities in the world. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=68.14s)]
*  It had a huge crime problem. We've seen it across the country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=70.4s)]
*  Our great cities have have just become crime infected. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=73.28s)]
*  And so when we took over a year ago, we made public safety [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=77.34s)]
*  not only in New Orleans, but for the rest of the state, a top priority. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=80.28s)]
*  And we worked with the legislature and we did a number of things. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=83.72s)]
*  And we started to see and we're continuing to see a reduction in crime. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=86.28s)]
*  And we were, you know, preparing for the Super Bowl. Right. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=89.38000000000001s)]
*  And then, of course, the tragedy on New Year's Day happens. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  And I just it causes you to recalibrate like, you know, OK, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=95.42s)]
*  how do we do this? What do we miss? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=99.26s)]
*  And everybody I will. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=101.76s)]
*  You know, the thing of it is, is that once this game is over [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  and everybody has had a great time, the people who really deserve the thanks [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  that are men and women in uniform who have been working 24 and seven. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=112.02s)]
*  Yeah. To put this game on. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=116.32s)]
*  And you can see it. I saw the memorial on Bourbon Street. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=117.62s)]
*  You see the security presence around. It does feel safe. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=120.32s)]
*  Speaking of safety. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=123.16s)]
*  I mean, getting into the stadium, even this morning at 5 a.m., [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=124.2s)]
*  it's no small task. Secret services everywhere. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=127.3s)]
*  You're going to be sitting someplace special tonight. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=129.56s)]
*  I was trying to find where you're going to be sitting. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=131.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think we're right over there. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=132.88s)]
*  And in Miss Gayle Benson's suite in the Saints suite and be with the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=134.1s)]
*  president, watching the game with the president, the attorney general is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=139.06s)]
*  coming in. I think the secretary, Kristi Noem, is going to be here, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=142.06s)]
*  which goes to show you the importance of it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=144.6s)]
*  I got to tell you, the president, for him to be a first sitting president [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=146.1s)]
*  to ever be at a Super Bowl. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=149.88s)]
*  But you know what? He's making a statement. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=151.38s)]
*  This is a city that reeled from a terrorist attack on January 1, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=152.83999999999997s)]
*  where a guy drives down Bourbon Street with an ISIS flag and the president [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=156.48s)]
*  comes in and says, you know what? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=159.78s)]
*  I know that this city is safe. I believe in America. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  We we don't count out and I'm going to be at the Super Bowl. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=164.32s)]
*  Right. It's going to be wonderful. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=167.01999999999998s)]
*  By the way, this looks wonderful. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's beautiful. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=169.54s)]
*  The Super Bowl is looking good. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=170.84s)]
*  We were having a little amphibian hunting competition. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=171.78s)]
*  So I said, this is the this is the frogs we get over there in Texas. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  I don't know. I imagine in Louisiana, they get some good sized bullfrogs. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=177.73999999999998s)]
*  But you bring them over to my camp. I can use them. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  I'll send them back with a bunch of frogs, turtles, frogs. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=184.28s)]

*  could have turtle soup in his suite? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4TI6YQKt3s&t=201.57999999999998s)]
