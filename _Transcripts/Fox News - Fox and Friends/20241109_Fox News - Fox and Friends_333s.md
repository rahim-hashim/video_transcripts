# VP Harris' 'coronation' was an 'epic disaster,' says DNC official
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ)
*  Top Democrats still trying to process Vice President Harris' stunning loss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The former speaker, Nancy Pelosi, placing the blame on President Biden and his late [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=6.2s)]
*  exit from the race. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Pelosi telling the New York Times, quote, had the president gotten out sooner, there [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  may have been other candidates in the race. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=16.94s)]
*  The anticipation was that if the president were to step aside, that there would be an [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=19.72s)]
*  open primary. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=23.64s)]
*  Our next guest has recently been vocal about missteps made in the Harris campaign. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=24.84s)]
*  The former President of the United States, DNC, woman's chair and Harris surrogate, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=28.52s)]
*  Lindy Lee, joining us now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=32.76s)]
*  Lindy, we appreciate you being here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=33.76s)]
*  This is sort of an after analysis here of what happened with the campaign. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=35.76s)]
*  But first, talk to me about what's going on. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=41.68s)]
*  You see here Nancy Pelosi making the case to sort of blame Joe Biden, but it's a backhanded [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=43.68s)]
*  compliment because she's blaming Joe Biden for allowing Kamala Harris to be the nominee. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=48.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=54.0s)]
*  Well, thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=55.0s)]
*  What she's saying is that she is not forcefully saying that Harris would have been the strongest [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=56.48s)]
*  candidate after a vigorous process. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=60.04s)]
*  She's not saying definitively that it would have been her. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=61.96s)]
*  She says it might have been her. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=64.34s)]
*  But you know, maybe there was an alternative. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=65.84s)]
*  Maybe it was Josh Shapiro or maybe Gretchen Whitmer, someone who can forcefully litigate [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=67.98s)]
*  the case against Donald Trump. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=72.48s)]
*  And if you truly believe that Trump is an existential threat, and that's what Democrats [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=74.06s)]
*  have been saying for the past couple years, then you should have had that process instead [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  of just coronating somebody. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=80.94s)]
*  What is the relationship? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=84.08s)]
*  What has been the relationship throughout the campaign? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=85.72s)]
*  And what do you think the relationship is today between Biden world and Kamala Harris [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=88.0s)]
*  world? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=92.28s)]
*  Well, I have friends, I mean, in both worlds. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=93.28s)]
*  And let me tell you, the relationship was terrible even before the campaign. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=94.6s)]
*  There was backstabbing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=98.2s)]
*  They wanted to hand her the most, you know, least favorable agenda. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=99.2s)]
*  You know, the legislative priority is she was stuck with immigration, civil rights, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=103.84s)]
*  like none of that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=107.84s)]
*  Before she was even a candidate, you're saying, as vice president. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=108.84s)]
*  There was a lot of backstabbing we saw in the press. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=111.2s)]
*  All the time, the White House leaking like a seed when it came to Kamala Harris. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=114.76s)]
*  And finally, in the final year, she was able to stabilize and stop the bleeding of her [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=118.72s)]
*  staff because there was a lot of turnover as well. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=122.76s)]
*  And we saw the press reports about that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=125.12s)]
*  And things have finally started to calm down. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=127.38000000000001s)]
*  And I actually think President Biden, you know, the whole endorsing her 30 minutes after [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  he dropped out, I think that was a big F you to the party. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=135.78s)]
*  You know, you don't want me here somebody that you may not like, but deal with it, you [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=138.44s)]
*  know. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=142.68s)]
*  You mean that he's sticking the party with Kamala Harris? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=143.68s)]
*  Kind of like sticking it to the man. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but okay. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=146.88s)]
*  Help me understand your perspective on that because you worked for Kamala Harris. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=147.88s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=151.4s)]
*  I'm a donor. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=152.4s)]
*  You're a donor. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=153.4s)]
*  Technically, I mean, you know, I am not on anyone's payroll. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=154.4s)]
*  I'm not beholden to anyone. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  That's why I'm here telling the truth. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm not here to gaslight anybody. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=159.12s)]
*  This is just the truth. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=160.72s)]
*  And what is the truth? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=161.72s)]
*  The truth is the this is just an epic disaster. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=163.12s)]
*  This is a one billion, a one billion dollar disaster. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  Actually, it was one billion, 18 million, I think, right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  Or 20 million or 20 million or 18 million dollars in in debt. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=172.92s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=176.84s)]
*  And I raised millions of that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=177.84s)]
*  I have friends that I have to be accountable to and explain what happened because I told [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=179.04s)]
*  them it was a margin of error race. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=183.28s)]
*  I was promised General Malley Dillon promised all of us that Harris would win. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=184.84s)]
*  She even put videos out saying that Harris would win. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=189.44s)]
*  I believed her. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=192.2s)]
*  My donors believed her. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=193.38s)]
*  And so they wrote massive checks. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=195.16s)]
*  I just I feel like a lot of us were misled. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=197.44s)]
*  And even on the night of election night, well, I looked somebody in the eye and I said, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=199.84s)]
*  are we going to do this? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=203.68s)]
*  Are we going to pull it off? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=204.68s)]
*  She told me yes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=205.88000000000002s)]
*  And I asked somebody else, like, how are you feeling? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=207.16000000000003s)]
*  He's like, we're going to win Iowa. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  And I was like, did they believe this going in? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  Was there a real sense of false confidence on the side of Kamala Harris? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=214.96s)]
*  What did they know? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  They were in in store for disaster. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  You know, I was wondering about that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=222.88000000000002s)]
*  I was like, are you I asked them, are you privy to internal numbers that I am not seeing? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  Because I study this so carefully and I just wasn't seeing any basis for that level of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=228.32s)]
*  confidence. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  And I also want to remind our viewers that, you know, the Trump campaign was touting all [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  of these incredible empirical data weeks before election night. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=239.44s)]
*  What Harris is touting was the door knocking. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=243.12s)]
*  She didn't say anything really about early voting. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=245.32s)]
*  Now I know it's because there was nothing much to say. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=248.24s)]
*  I asked you what the relationship was between Biden world and Kamala Harris world and you [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=251.64s)]
*  told me it was bad. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=256.21999999999997s)]
*  Predating the campaign. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=257.62s)]
*  Where does Obama world fit in this? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  You know, there's I don't want I don't want to break the Democratic Party into these three [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=261.86s)]
*  fiefdoms because there's probably more. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=267.42s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi is a huge power player. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  But Barack Obama, the Obama world is a huge player. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=271.48s)]
*  How do they fit in the tension or the happiness of Democrats? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=275.06s)]
*  That's a really good question. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=279.22s)]
*  I want to point out that they waited three days. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=280.22s)]
*  Michelle and Barack Obama waited three days to endorse Kamala Harris. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=282.66s)]
*  It was a silence heard around the world. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=286.22s)]
*  And prior to Biden's endorsement that no one really anticipated, they were vetting people [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=289.06s)]
*  like Mark Kelly. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=294.26s)]
*  Kamala Harris wasn't at the top of the ticket. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=295.58s)]
*  So Biden's endorsement of Harris caught a lot of people off guard, even the chieftains [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=298.0s)]
*  of the party. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=302.58s)]
*  I really think it was a big it was a big effort. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=303.58s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=307.18s)]
*  It's all right. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=308.18s)]
*  I think I think I'm getting a vivid picture. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=309.18s)]
*  I didn't finish the word specifically when it comes to why or the effect and perhaps [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=310.18s)]
*  the plan on when Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=315.6s)]
*  Really interesting insight, Lindy. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=318.76s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alzdNWoylQ&t=320.24s)]
