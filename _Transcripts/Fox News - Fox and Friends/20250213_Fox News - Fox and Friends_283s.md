# Judge Jeanine: This is out of control
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0)
*  There's a new sheriff coming for the Empire State Attorney General Pam Bondi suing New York State and its leaders over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=0.0s)]
*  sanctuary policies getting in the way of immigration efforts [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=7.16s)]
*  This is a new DOJ and we are taking steps to protect Americans [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=11.08s)]
*  New York has chosen to prioritize illegal aliens over American citizens [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=16.42s)]
*  It stops it stops today. You will be held accountable if you do not follow federal law [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=22.32s)]
*  It's over it ends and we're coming after you here to react as co-host of the five judge Janine Pirro [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=29.1s)]
*  Good morning. Good morning. You look beautiful. Well, so you're so kind. Thank you are so you know the laws [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=35.620000000000005s)]
*  Yeah of New York, especially yeah, what does this mean? Will this go anywhere? Oh, yeah, it definitely will look the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=41.5s)]
*  President Trump has said there's a crisis of illegal immigration and the American public is with him on it [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=48.38s)]
*  Vast majority 83% want wholesale change [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=55.52s)]
*  So this lawsuit is being brought against the state of New York after they sued, Illinois last week [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=58.48s)]
*  And they said look your sanctuary policies are basically obstructing federal law [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=64.84s)]
*  There is something called the supremacy clause and that preempts any of your state laws [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=70.08s)]
*  So what are we talking about specifically in 2019 New York passed a green light law [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=75.36s)]
*  Which basically said you know what any illegal who wants a driver's license we're gonna give you a driver's license [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=80.60000000000001s)]
*  The problem with that is that they are refusing to give any information from that license whether it's an [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  Identification whether it's an address whether it's vehicle registration and when you've got law enforcement [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=93.98s)]
*  Whether it's local state border patrol anyone else in terms of real time and they're coming up against an individual [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  And they cannot get information from DMV that law has to be struck down [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  It puts all of law enforcement border patrol ice everyone in danger [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=112.16s)]
*  So you've got all of this attempt to prevent the federal government from enforcing the law and you know, Pam Bondi is right [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=116.8s)]
*  I mean you can't just have a law and think you're on your own [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  There is a supremacy clause here and what Hokel says look we're gonna stand by New Yorkers and we're not gonna back down [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=127.32s)]
*  They're illegal immigrants governor and it's reflected not just in terms of law enforcement, but in terms of the money [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=134.8s)]
*  There's the economy issue. There's the claw back of the FEMA the federal funds [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=142.0s)]
*  This is out of control and Donald Trump is saying no more [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  So it sounds like because of the supremacy supremacy clause Donald Trump will win [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  He shouldn't win. He absolutely will win on this this green light law is I mean, it's like every state saying [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, we're our own nation and we're not gonna we're not going to abide by the Constitution [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=159.98000000000002s)]
*  Look immigration is a federal issue. The state has no role to play [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=164.28s)]
*  They certainly they don't have to do anything, but they cannot obstruct the federal government [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=169.68s)]
*  What happens if Pam Bondi wins one of these cases the one in Illinois or the one here? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=174.44s)]
*  What does that mean for sanctuary cities and states elsewhere? Well, what it means is you're gonna lose money [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=178.16s)]
*  You're gonna lose a lot of these grants [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=183.72s)]
*  You're gonna lose the FEMA money and we're gonna start seeing the deportations happen a lot quicker [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=186.18s)]
*  And they will hold them in contempt and this is the kind of thing that President Trump said he would do and he's doing it [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=192.52s)]
*  You have a great special on Fox Nation. It's called subway justice. It's about Daniel Penny [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=198.92s)]
*  Let's watch a clip and then we'll get your reaction the other side [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=204.1s)]
*  The reality is when you had to put the facts in front of the jury the district attorney had to admit that Danny his [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=207.36s)]
*  Intentions in getting involved in this were laudable [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=214.2s)]
*  He took Jordan Neely down for the right reason to protect those other passengers a [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=217.16s)]
*  Jury agreed [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=223.96s)]
*  Okay, so what's great about this Fox Nation special is we talk about Danny Penny, of course, and we also talk about Bernie Getz [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=227.0s)]
*  decades apart both of them standing up when no one would stand up to protect them and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=234.64s)]
*  amazingly, they ended up in the same courthouse in New York City the same address and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=240.04s)]
*  You know you see how [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  Society hasn't really changed that much where people have to end up defending themselves or others and you look at how the jury's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  Responded in each case. There's a lot of similarities between Penny and gets but a lot of differences as well [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  You've got to watch this Fox Nation special. Thank you so much judge. It's excellent [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=260.6s)]
*  So just go to Fox Nation comm to watch judge Janine special again. It's called subway justice [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=264.44s)]
*  We'll be watching you today on the five. Okay, judge [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=269.88s)]
*  You [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOm1-4tRqz0&t=274.68s)]
