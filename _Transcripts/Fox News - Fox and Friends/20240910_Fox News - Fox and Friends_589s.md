# Trump could present Harris with a 'special gift'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk)
*  Now let's check in with Peter Doocy with a look at how team Harris is preparing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey, Peter. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=4.16s)]
*  Ainsley tonight is going to be kind of surreal for Vice President Harris [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  because for the last couple of days she's been staring at a staffer dressed [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=10.96s)]
*  as Donald Trump and tonight she's going to meet him in person for the first time ever. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=16.16s)]
*  I think he's gonna lie and you know he has a playbook that he has used in the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=23.76s)]
*  past be it you know his attacks on President Obama or Hillary Clinton so we [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=29.72s)]
*  should expect that some of that might come out. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=38.12s)]
*  The vice president claims her values have not changed since 2019 so tonight [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=41.68s)]
*  she may have to explain why in 2019 she wrote that she supported sex changes [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  for migrants with this quote. I support policies ensuring that federal prisoners [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=50.82s)]
*  and detainees are able to obtain medically necessary care for gender [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=55.16s)]
*  transition including surgical care while incarcerated or detained and she also [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  may need to explain tonight the call to cut ice funding also in 2019 quote our [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=64.72s)]
*  immigrant detention system is out of control and I believe we must end the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=70.6s)]
*  unfair incarceration of thousands of individuals families and children. I [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=74.16s)]
*  was one of the first senators after President Trump was elected to advocate [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=78.12s)]
*  for a decrease in funding to ice the basics of the rules tonight are as [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=82.24s)]
*  follows muted microphones no live studio audience only a pen paper and water on [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=87.52s)]
*  stage no pre written notes the answers are two minutes the rebuttals are two [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=93.28s)]
*  minutes follow-ups are one minute the vice president decided to spend most of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  this week in Pennsylvania she did debate camp in Pittsburgh flew here to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=102.36s)]
*  Philadelphia yesterday in the afternoon she spent the night at a hotel as [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=107.28s)]
*  opposed to Donald Trump who plans to fly up from Florida later on this [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=110.72s)]
*  afternoon back to you Peter they have never come face to face and I know the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=114.32s)]

*  point he might present her with a special gift yes former President Trump [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=124.56s)]
*  said at a rally that he thinks because he feels that the vice president is [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=133.48s)]
*  borrowing from his platform with things like the taxes on no taxes on tips and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=138.12s)]
*  he says that he's got a specially made MAGA hat for the vice president it seems [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=142.96s)]

*  published in the Washington Post and it's talking about how he can knock her [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=311.24s)]
*  out of the race and in this one debate says that she's had cringe-worthy word [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=314.8s)]
*  salads but that Donald Trump has some risks as well he can't come in too hot [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=319.68s)]
*  and number one he says that Donald Trump needs to remind swing voters of what [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=324.4s)]
*  they like about him and his policies and he says you know Donald Trump will get [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=328.5s)]
*  on stage and say you know stick everyone's telling me stick to my [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=332.72s)]
*  policies don't get personal yet the Democrats are personal all night long [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  and we saw that at the DNC says when he focuses on policy he reminds swing [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=340.48s)]
*  voters of what they liked about his presidency number two Steve you want to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=344.92s)]
*  take out don't remind swing voters of what they don't like about him and you [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=349.68s)]
*  know you know there you know we've heard a lot of people talk about okay Donald [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  Trump he gets too personal and that is terrible for him stick to policy he [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=359.12s)]
*  says don't mention January 6 if you do that's a losing that you're gonna lose [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=363.36s)]
*  he said Kamala will try to bait him into defending January 6 and he can't take [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=367.4s)]
*  that bait so we'd have to see how they do that point three make Harris the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=372.0s)]
*  incumbent and tie her to Biden that's not too hard because she is and she is [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=376.16s)]
*  he said can I go ahead go ahead in number three he says Trump needs to [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=380.32s)]
*  remind voters that she's been in office for four years don't call her comrade [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=384.64s)]
*  Kamala call her madam vice president there you go and finally make Harris's [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=388.48s)]
*  own her record and we listen the problem is she's got a lot on her record because [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=393.48s)]
*  she has flip-flopped so many times or change policies whatever nonetheless the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=401.36s)]
*  former president I'm sure is prepared for that and I'm sure she is as well [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=406.8s)]
*  Mark Tieson was on our program about 45 minutes ago and said this about what the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=410.76s)]
*  former president needs to do his audience tonight is not MAGA voters his [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=416.72s)]
*  audience is a small number of undecided swing voters in a handful of swing [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=422.20000000000005s)]
*  states who are going to decide the presidential election so he needs to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=426.24s)]
*  those are voters who don't like the direction of the country thought that he [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=429.20000000000005s)]
*  did a good job as president but don't like a lot of his behavior and a lot of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=432.52000000000004s)]
*  the things he says and are reluctant to put him back in the Oval Office [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=435.6s)]
*  everything he says tonight should keep in mind those voters and persuade them [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=438.08000000000004s)]
*  to vote for him how do you prepare for a presidential debate what do you do first [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=442.64000000000004s)]
*  you go through a series of primaries where you where you're being challenged [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=446.12s)]
*  by your own party then you do town halls with voters where you ask tough [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=449.56s)]
*  questions not for handpicked voters like real voters like in New Hampshire where [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=452.44s)]
*  you go out in their independence people challenging you then you then you do [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=455.6s)]
*  interviews with with media and you do press conferences where people ask you [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=458.84000000000003s)]
*  tough questions then you lay out a some major policy speeches where you lay out [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=462.84000000000003s)]
*  your agenda and think through what I want to do as president and and arguments [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=467.08s)]
*  to defend that and he she hasn't done any of that you know the hard thing [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=471.4s)]
*  about everyone that of course we all think we're the smartest people you want [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=475.36s)]
*  to provide advice for the former president you say it on TV and everything [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=480.12s)]
*  I think the most challenging part is he's not your typical politician and so [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=483.12s)]
*  when you're providing advice to him about what he should do it has to be [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=487.88s)]
*  within his style because he's gonna be Donald Trump as we've seen time and time [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=491.0s)]
*  again and I think he wants to go on the office I think the only piece of advice [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=495.04s)]
*  I would say it's totally fine to go in the office just keep it within the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=499.72s)]
*  policies that affect people on the day-to-day basis he's got to do [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=504.44s)]
*  nicknames that's who he is as a person he's going is gonna want to attack [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=509.24s)]
*  attack attack you just can't allow her to get under your skin there's two [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=513.2s)]
*  things you have Bernie Sanders saying she's saying anything to get elected [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=517.28s)]
*  she's so progressive and number two you have somebody that just covered for Joe [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=520.64s)]
*  Biden for three and a half years up until the day that she got the phone [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaRXPgdmZk&t=524.68s)]
