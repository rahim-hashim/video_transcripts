# Dana Perino: The gravy train is over
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c)
*  Well, the Education Secretary Linda McMahon has announced plans to claw back the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=0.0s)]
*  $188 billion in student loan forgiveness granted under Joe Biden in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=5.8s)]
*  She writes quote debt doesn't go away [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  It gets transferred to others if borrowers don't pay their debts to the government taxpayers do [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  America's newsroom co-anchor and the five co-hosts Dana Perino one of those people also a taxpayer joins us right now [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=21.92s)]
*  Yes, believe me taxpayer. Well, remember when this all happened [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=29.06s)]
*  It looked like Joe Biden was trying to buy votes by the votes of young people who had outstanding [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=33.019999999999996s)]
*  Student loans didn't work didn't work, but it cost all of us. So it was a co vid era policy [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=39.06s)]
*  It's time for it to go away, right? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=44.96s)]
*  But she announced today yesterday and in the Wall Street Journal piece today that I thought was very good [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=46.34s)]
*  Is that the gravy train is over and also remember it was Nancy Pelosi who said Joe Biden doesn't have the legal authority to do this [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=50.58s)]
*  They tried to do it. Anyway, the courts kept pushing it back [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=57.9s)]
*  So they had false hopes false promises to people and I understand the student loan debt can be a burden [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=60.26s)]
*  It doesn't mean the system shouldn't be changed or that the interest rate couldn't be lowered [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  But they are going to have to pay it back [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=69.94s)]
*  Nobody helped somebody that bought an f-150 as a plumber pay that bill right and none of us should have to they pay their bills [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=71.78s)]
*  Everyone should pay their bills. It doesn't mean the system can't be reformed it. Here's what she writes [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=78.9s)]
*  I have another hard truth for the institutions that made empty promises to students while pocketing their loan dollars [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=83.28s)]
*  Colleges and universities call themselves nonprofits [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=89.52s)]
*  But for years they have profited massively off the federal subsidy of loans hiking tuition and piling up billion dollar endowments [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=92.0s)]
*  While students graduate six figures in the red, right? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=98.68s)]
*  So more truth in advertising is good better decision-making is also good [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=102.8s)]
*  The other thing that she says is that they have [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=106.48s)]
*  Set up more help to help figure out a way so that the payment can fit your budget [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=108.48s)]
*  That has to come true. They have to be able to answer the phone and get answers for that. Hopefully that will work out [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=113.84s)]
*  She's also using artificial intelligence to help make that happen. No kidding. Yeah somebody. All right [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=118.92s)]
*  I'll listen. This is gonna be the number one book in the world [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=123.04s)]
*  Dana's got a brand new book. It's I wish somebody had told me and for years after your first book [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=128.36s)]
*  People have come to you for mentoring advice. Hey, what do I do? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=134.32s)]
*  And and you've come up with many different answers, but it seems like everybody's asking the same question [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=136.96s)]
*  They all they are and also the people that I mentored 10 15 years ago when I left the White House [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  They're still asking me questions [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=146.28s)]
*  So I and I've realized I don't have all the answers [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=148.28s)]
*  But I work with a lot of people who do I have friends with people who have incredible stories. They've changed careers [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  They've become mothers and fathers. They've retired into next chapters and they figured out a way to figure that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=157.2s)]
*  Work-life balance that everybody's looking for the other thing is different with this book is that it's not just for young women [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=163.48s)]
*  I did this for everybody. In fact, you're in the book and Johnny Bellisario who works for Jesse Waters [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=169.28s)]
*  You know, he does the man on the streets [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=174.88s)]
*  he read it over the weekend and your piece of advice in the back as the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=176.56s)]
*  The wish somebody had told you something is his favorite story in the book [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=180.52s)]
*  Thank you, and it's basically is be nice to everybody. That's right. Um, here's the clip [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=184.72s)]
*  Okay, so my advice to young people is just know that life takes effort [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=190.7s)]
*  Nobody ever tells you that when you're a kid, otherwise nobody would ever leave the house [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  Just know that if you only want to do what's easy life will probably be hard if you want to be successful in a job [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=199.98s)]
*  Just know nobody is going to give you anything [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  That's exactly right [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  One of the things that's a joy about working with the people here who contributed to this book is that a lot of people didn't [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  Come from trust funds, you know, you worked hard you worked every I was country music DJ [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=217.9s)]
*  I worked overnights during college so that I could get into the TV business and then I went into politics and then I was [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=222.74s)]
*  Able to come back here and over time was given opportunities that are incredible. So it's a Fox News book and I'm thrilled with it [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=228.54000000000002s)]
*  Well, listen, you have been absolutely you have been a role model to a generation of young women and now everybody [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNk8t-Fuo9c&t=233.94s)]
