# 'Never seen anything like this': Perino, hosts on Trump defeating Harris
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE)
*  OK, the knives are out. Democrats on the Harris team wasting no time pointing fingers over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=0.0s)]
*  President-elect Trump's historic comeback. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=10.08s)]
*  A lot of people are probably wondering tonight what would have happened had Shapiro been [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=12.56s)]
*  on the ticket. And not only in terms of Pennsylvania, he's famously a moderate. So that would have [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  signaled to the American people that she is not the San Francisco liberal that Trump said [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  she was. But I'm not sure how much Tim Walls contributed to the ticket. She was trying to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=25.86s)]
*  show that she was going to be unifier, but that may have undermined her goal in that she had to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=31.1s)]
*  get everyone on the same page. And the Biden folks were maybe still understandably upset that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=37.78s)]
*  they were that their leader was unceremoniously basically pushed aside. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=43.06s)]
*  Well, that could be one element of it. Let's get the reaction from America's newsroom zone, co-anchor [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=48.5s)]
*  of the five, co-host Dana Perino. Dana, your thoughts about the excuse making that's taking [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=52.94s)]
*  place right now is going to pick up in volume and in volume big time. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=59.379999999999995s)]
*  Well, I have a couple of things. First of all, if she had picked Shapiro, she was probably still [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=64.02s)]
*  going to lose. And then they would have basically sullied his opportunity if he wants to run in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=68.42s)]
*  twenty twenty eight. Secondly, they're just blaming Tim Walls. I think that guy would have been [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=74.34s)]
*  happy to stay in Minneapolis. Why are they blaming him? Why not look at the person who made the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=79.54s)]
*  decision to put him on the ticket? And I don't care if they say it was somebody on her team. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=86.14s)]
*  She was the decider. She put him on the ticket. And just a few days ago, he was quoted saying he [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=91.9s)]
*  hadn't spoken to her in days. So why are they going to blame her? Blame him? I'm sure he's like, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=98.06s)]
*  let me just go back to Minneapolis. I'm happy to be the governor there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=104.3s)]
*  But they also lost their entire coalition. Yeah, I mean, we've never seen anything like this. And [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=107.02s)]
*  the voters kept telling them what they wanted to hear about. Yet she provided no information. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=112.3s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like there's just no reason to make this more complicated than it is. In May of twenty [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=116.7s)]
*  twenty one, they started saying that the economy is a problem. And they said that consistently, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=122.06s)]
*  they being the voters. But I remember reminded of four things. First of all, Ron Klain, the chief [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  of staff to Biden said early on that inflation is not real. And then he said it was a high class [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=132.22s)]
*  problem. OK, also, they said for how many years that the border is closed. And they said it over [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=138.7s)]
*  and over again. Another thing they said, crime is going down. OK, right. Oh, let's look around. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=145.1s)]
*  Look around you folks. And number four, they said that Joe Biden runs circles around all the staff [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=150.7s)]
*  at the White House. Right. And those were the four things that I could just come up with while I was [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=157.18s)]
*  in hair and makeup trying to wake up after two hours sleep and said, you guys said it over and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=160.86s)]
*  over again. Then you take all the positive things that Trump did on his campaign in order to win. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  But Biden and Harris, they have they want to blame somebody. They just got to hold up a mirror. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=170.78s)]
*  Yeah, no kidding. No doubt about it. This morning, people are waking up saying our [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=176.22000000000003s)]
*  Democrat Party is broken. You've got a very your show is not broken. You are thriving. You got a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=180.22000000000003s)]
*  big show today. We do. We're going to kick it off with Karl Rove and Harold Ford Jr. Because I [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=186.46s)]
*  did not get enough of them last night. And I want to see Harold Ford Jr. This morning. But the other [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=190.7s)]
*  thing is, I don't know, I'm going to go out on a limb. I mean, we are waiting for a race call in [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=194.7s)]
*  Pennsylvania Senate. And maybe that comes during newsroom. I don't know if that's true. Hammer. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=198.78s)]
*  I think so. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, I think so. OK, he says it might. So I guess I'm not too far out on [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=204.61999999999998s)]
*  a limb. Speak during your show. Well, she should speak. And I think it is shameful that they didn't [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=209.82s)]
*  come out last night and let President Trump have his victory, his election night and just concede [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=214.7s)]
*  because it wasn't like it was a question of what was going to happen here. You know, Dana Perino, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=219.74s)]
*  you're flawless. Two hours of sleep. Fantastic. Don't look beneath the hood. OK, thanks guys. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=224.62s)]
*  We'll be watching. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley Earhart. And click here [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0v6gbcWbE&t=231.18s)]
