# NEW: Illegal immigrants charged in cartel-linked train heist
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk)
*  All right, welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=0.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court is going to hear arguments later today in a case the country of Mexico [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=2.58s)]
*  is bringing against American gun manufacturers. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=7.68s)]
*  Mexico says, quote, just as American officials are worried on the movement of drugs from [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=11.28s)]
*  Mexican territory into the United States, we are worried and working on the entry of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=15.88s)]
*  weapons from the United States to Mexico. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=20.62s)]
*  What is that about? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=24.3s)]
*  Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett joins us right now on this Monday. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=25.3s)]
*  Hey, Greg. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=28.84s)]
*  Well, Steve, there's a difference between illegal drugs and, you know, legal firearms. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=29.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=37.2s)]
*  So, you know, Mexico's lawsuit is, I think, another in a long line of attacks against [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=38.2s)]
*  gun manufacturers in America. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=43.6s)]
*  I suspect Supreme Court will reject it as they have the other attempts to hold gun makers [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=45.6s)]
*  responsible for injuries or deaths caused by firearms. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=51.94s)]
*  You know, we do have broad protections for manufacturers that are written in our law, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=56.64s)]
*  shielding them from most liability. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=61.72s)]
*  It's not their fault if criminals misuse lawful products. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=64.16s)]
*  And there's no evidence here that gun makers are coordinating with cartels. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=69.68s)]
*  The fact is Mexican criminal gangs are very good at smuggling guns, and sadly, Mexico [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=74.48s)]
*  is inept at fighting cartels. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=79.8s)]
*  So, you know, they blame American makers of weapons instead of themselves. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  As I say, I don't think it's going to work, Steve. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=88.0s)]
*  They should be suing themselves for their own incompetence. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=89.64s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=92.92s)]
*  And, you know, President Scheinbaum down in Mexico, she's got that midnight deadline [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=93.92s)]
*  over the tariffs. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=98.76s)]
*  Lou Amin, she's got that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=99.76s)]
*  And the United States is talking about classifying the cartels as terrorists. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  So what's she doing? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  She's pushing back. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  But if they were successful, look for people in the future to, if they get picked up for [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=107.52s)]
*  a DUI, to sue Mexico, because I was drinking Mexican tequila, baby, and what goes around [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=112.36s)]
*  comes around. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=118.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=119.32s)]
*  One other thing we want to talk to you about. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=120.32s)]
*  Who knew that apparently the train heist is back? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=122.0s)]
*  And apparently it's happening with great regularity. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=126.44s)]
*  And there are 11 defendants who have been charged with close to a half a million dollars [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=130.88s)]
*  with the stolen Nikes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=135.36s)]
*  Turns out, wait for it, they're in the country illegally. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=137.28s)]
*  They are migrants who it looks like are working for the cartels. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=141.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=146.24s)]
*  Thanks Joe Biden yet again. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  It looks to me like the cartel bosses in Mexico are probably watching the old Butch Cassidy [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=150.56s)]
*  film El Chapo's Sinaloa Cartel. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=156.0s)]
*  As masterminded these train heists, stolen Nikes, other products, using illegals here [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  to actually pull off the holdups. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=167.6s)]
*  Pretty shocking, Steve. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  These train robberies increased 40% with 65,000 cargo thefts exceeding a hundred million dollars. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  The solution I think here, install anti-theft technology. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=182.24s)]
*  You know, if that doesn't work, do what the train operator E.H. Harriman did in the Butch [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=187.16s)]
*  Cassidy movie. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=192.28s)]
*  Get some armed guards on horses or hire Lord Baltimore and Joe LaFors. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=194.08s)]
*  That'll force the thieves to move to Bolivia. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=200.2s)]
*  No kidding. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=203.64s)]
*  You've got to wonder though, Greg, whether the cartels, which are famous for human trafficking [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=204.64s)]
*  and bringing people into the United States illegally, they charge by the head, but maybe [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=208.64s)]
*  they're cracking a deal. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=213.56s)]
*  Okay, you go to the United States, we'll get you in there free, but you've got to knock [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=215.24s)]
*  over some, not banks, but trains because they are not guarded and they're easy picket. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=218.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, I think there is a built-in financial incentive associated with many of the illegals [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=225.44s)]
*  that come into the United States assisted by the cartels. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=232.96s)]
*  They don't just send drugs into the U.S. but, you know, people with criminal intent and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=237.8s)]
*  that's their mission. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=244.0s)]
*  All right, Greg, counselor, thank you very much. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=245.0s)]
*  Have a great Monday. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=247.68s)]
*  Thanks, Steve. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=248.68s)]
*  Take care. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=249.68s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plfKS9o1UCk&t=250.68s)]
