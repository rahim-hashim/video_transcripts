# Judge Jeanine Pirro: This will be a long, contentious trial
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4)
*  Judge Jeanine Pirro has been examining the case closely in her new Fox Nation series [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=0.0s)]
*  They get there quite quickly within 15 minutes according to Karen Reed herself John is apparently still alive [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=16.56s)]
*  But he has visible injuries. It looks like he was in a fight [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=22.34s)]
*  What happened co-host of the five judge Jeanine Pirro joins us right now judge [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=27.8s)]
*  First first trial ended in a hung jury and now you know she said so many things [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=32.72s)]
*  She says she's the victim of an elaborate cover-up [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=37.6s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know it's interesting a DA has a decision to make after a first [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=40.78s)]
*  Trial ends up in a mistrial because the jury is hung the DA says well [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Maybe I'll try to get a plea bargain or maybe I won't try her again [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  But this DA says not only am I gonna try this woman again? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=54.68s)]
*  We're gonna bring in a new prosecutor a former defense attorney in wider but whitey bulgers case [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  Guy by the name of Brennan who is now looking to get all kinds of statements and she has made subsequent to the hung jury [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=63.04s)]
*  The media statements the media statements that will indicate her state of mind and what she was thinking [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=70.2s)]
*  But look the bottom line here is this is a case where a woman Karen Reed is accused of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=76.26s)]
*  Ditching hitting and ditching her boyfriend after a night of drinking and dropping him off at a friend's house in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=83.58s)]
*  Massachusetts and she is alleging that the friends beat him up and then left him outside and then the dog apparently according to her [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=91.94s)]
*  Attacked him as well, which would explain some puncture wounds in the arm [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=99.1s)]
*  But the second trial will be even more interesting than the first because there is an alternate juror from the first trial [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=103.02s)]
*  Who is now representing her and is on her defense team Wow there so in addition to a new prosecutor [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=109.66s)]
*  We have an additional defense attorney [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=115.78s)]
*  We also have crucial evidence and that is the data from the SUV the Lexus [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=117.58s)]
*  The judges allowed them to reassemble that and it will tell us at what speed she was going when she allegedly hit [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=122.66s)]
*  Her boyfriend the victim John O'Keefe who was a police officer by the way for 16 years [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=130.42s)]
*  There is also testimony from individuals [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  EMT police who say when they found him in the snow she said I hit him I hit him [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=139.38s)]
*  She's saying oh, no, I said did I hit him did I hit him? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=144.38s)]
*  But this is engaged all of the community you've got people protesting wearing shirts [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  The judge's issued a new buffer zone [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=153.98s)]
*  You can't be yelling so the jury can hear it and now they even went up to the Supreme Court and they're saying look we actually [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=156.22s)]
*  Decided that this she's not guilty based on an unofficial [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=163.42s)]
*  Verdict well there's no such thing as an unofficial verdict especially in a murder case [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=168.14s)]
*  So I you know there's no hope there [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=172.34s)]
*  But there is a lot of testimony that will come in that didn't come in before her last defense was two days [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  We expect her defense in this second trial would be two weeks [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=181.2s)]
*  Everybody has an opinion on this [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=185.1s)]
*  Everybody everybody yes, there's so much it looks like it's damning on its face [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=187.12s)]
*  But then again for the jury to hang that says something well [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=192.02s)]
*  It says something and you know you also have this guy this guy named the turtle boy [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=195.5s)]
*  Who's been charged with it? You know I guess harassing or intimidating witnesses who had a podcast everyone is out there [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=199.46s)]
*  Proliferating the story trying to get out there trying to get their side out there and in the end [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  This is going to be a long trial. It will be a very contentious trial and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=211.94s)]
*  If you want the bottom line here you should go to the Fox Nation special Karen Reed killer or convenient outsider [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=216.86s)]
*  It's available right now on Fox Nation calm and it's it is hosted by the great judge Jenny and Piero [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWAGwbG7pl4&t=223.74s)]
