# Hosts rip ‘embarrassing’ Dems at Trump address: 'JUVENILE'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ)
*  Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=0.0s)]
*  golden age of America. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=7.88s)]
*  From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=11.44s)]
*  greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=22.64s)]
*  And to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=26.68s)]
*  And we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=31.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=38.2s)]
*  The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=39.2s)]
*  We must have legislation to secure the border. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  In January, the US Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=56.68s)]
*  Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=66.24s)]
*  others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=72.24s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=78.24s)]
*  Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=79.24s)]
*  for that atrocity. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=85.98s)]
*  Now, for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=86.98s)]
*  headed in the right direction than the wrong direction. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  In fact, members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the House and to cease [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=96.42s)]
*  any further disruptions. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=102.42s)]
*  That's your warning. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=104.66s)]
*  Mr. Green, take your seat. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=105.66s)]
*  Take your seat, sir. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=110.38000000000001s)]
*  Remove this gentleman from the chamber. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=111.38000000000001s)]
*  Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=112.38s)]
*  so many incredible wins for America? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=124.66s)]
*  For the good of our nation, let's work together and let's truly make America great again. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=129.38s)]
*  There you go. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=143.38s)]
*  President Trump gave a historic address on the House floor, longest speech ever for a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=144.82s)]
*  State of the Union or an address to a joint session of Congress. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=148.74s)]
*  I'm live from our nation's capital and I believe we need a second source. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=151.42s)]
*  It is Ash Wednesday. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=155.98s)]
*  I'd like to take this time to say hello to my three anchors back in New York. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=156.98s)]
*  Thank you very much, Brian. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=162.18s)]
*  If today's Ash Wednesday, that means yesterday was Mardi Gras, Fat Tuesday, and a big celebration [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=163.18s)]
*  in that big round white building behind you, Brian. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday we were talking, how long do you think the speech is going to be? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=175.46s)]
*  I said probably, what about, probably knowing Trump and the applause he's going to get. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=178.14000000000001s)]
*  I said 100 minutes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=182.26000000000002s)]
*  I was off by one. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=183.38s)]
*  It was 99 minutes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=184.78s)]
*  But here's the thing, it never lagged. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=186.66s)]
*  And once again, Donald Trump has cemented his legacy, not only as the 45th and 47th [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=189.74s)]
*  But as a president who understands the television medium better than anybody who has ever held [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=197.5s)]
*  that post before. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=202.9s)]
*  People were laughing, people were crying, there were highs and lows and it was all about [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=205.06s)]
*  taking a victory lap so far and look ahead at a new golden age. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=208.54000000000002s)]
*  It was a missed opportunity yesterday. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  The president started the speech out saying, essentially, there's nothing I can do to please [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=215.5s)]
*  the Democrats. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=220.9s)]
*  They won't unify, they won't do anything. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=221.9s)]
*  And then he perceived the story tell, tell these incredible stories, just things that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  aren't partisan at all, aren't political at all, just wins for the country, average [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=228.94s)]
*  day people, and they did not stand up. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=233.66s)]
*  You look at the polling that came after this, CBS did a poll with YouGov, 76% agreed with [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=236.06s)]
*  removing the congressman, 76% approved of the speech. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=244.26s)]
*  And if you go down the list of all the issues when it comes to wasteful spending, immigration, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=249.38s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia war, over 70% of the country agreed with what the president said during [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=253.9s)]
*  his speech. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=259.26s)]
*  Yeah, it was a great speech and the president reminded the crowd that he's only been in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=260.26s)]
*  office for 43 days and he says we're just getting started. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=264.14s)]
*  A lot of people in the chamber, the Republicans chanting USA, USA, USA, when the Democrats [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=267.06s)]
*  started to heckle, their voices actually overpowered the Democratic voices. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=272.86s)]
*  But he reminded everyone that the election was a mandate. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=277.66s)]
*  He said we won all seven swing states, we won the popular vote by big numbers, he said [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=280.02s)]
*  270 to 525 to map out, that reads Republican and the Democrats were yelling and the Republicans [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=284.58s)]
*  were saying USA, USA. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=292.18s)]
*  Yeah, it was the mandate. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=293.18s)]
*  But I was in the chamber and I tell you, the story was really two countries. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=294.18s)]
*  I mean, you could not have been more juvenile as a Democrat. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=301.29999999999995s)]
*  All you could see from up top is the Democrats two rows, basically mostly female, writing [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=305.9s)]
*  down different things on erasable boards or deciding what circle sign to hold up. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=312.38s)]
*  And then this other one congresswoman, while he was walking in, was holding a sign that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=319.53999999999996s)]
*  said, this is not normal. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=325.29999999999995s)]
*  Then the Texas congressman grabbed it out of her hand. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=327.58s)]
*  And then to see this guy, Al Green, who by the way, Sean Duffy, walked down the aisle, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=330.5s)]
*  Secretary of Transportation, just talking to everyone. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=335.06s)]
*  I don't know what he was talking, I can't wait to ask him what I was talking to Al Green [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=337.5s)]
*  about. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=340.7s)]
*  They must have talked for 10 minutes. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=341.7s)]
*  So all of a sudden he just stands up and yells. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=342.90000000000003s)]
*  And the weird thing was, the sergeant of arms goes to Nancy Pelosi first. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=345.02000000000004s)]
*  Why are you checking with Nancy Pelosi? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=350.86s)]
*  He's standing up screaming at the President of the United States, why are you there? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=352.7s)]
*  Then he walks up, talks to him, he stops talking for a second, doesn't sit and starts yelling [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=358.02000000000004s)]
*  again. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=363.7s)]
*  He asks the speaker to get somebody else to come in and toss him out. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=364.74s)]
*  And then they talk to Nancy Pelosi again. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=368.21999999999997s)]
*  Did she approve of this behavior? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=369.9s)]
*  Do you need her to sign off on this? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=372.02s)]
*  I don't know, was she asking how's your new hip? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=373.9s)]
*  So to me, if you were going to sit there and text and hold up signs, I almost rather you [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=376.58s)]
*  do what AOC did and just stay home. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=381.58s)]
*  Just don't come. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=383.86s)]
*  Live stream. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=384.86s)]
*  Some of them were on their phones, they were holding up those paddles that said false. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=385.86s)]
*  It's embarrassing. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=388.26s)]
*  Someone had a whiteboard and they kept erasing and writing new messages on there in disagreement [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=389.26s)]
*  with Donald Trump. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=393.46s)]
*  Yeah, ultimately the Democrats, and there you can see the little round signs Brian was [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=395.21999999999997s)]
*  just talking about, the Democrats just look small because the message of Trump was big [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=399.9s)]
*  and it was for all Americans. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=406.34s)]
*  And a couple of times he talked a little bit about how we need to unite and get stuff done. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=407.9s)]
*  But the Democrats did sit on their hands, even when they had emotional and very special [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=412.9s)]
*  guests like these. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=420.02s)]
*  Alexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=423.06s)]
*  Across Galveston Bay from where Jocelyn lived in Houston, you will find a magnificent National [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=428.65999999999997s)]
*  Wildlife Refuge. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=434.9s)]
*  Moments ago I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=438.26s)]
*  Jocelyn. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=445.21999999999997s)]
*  The very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=446.5s)]
*  dangerous criminal aliens. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=454.06s)]
*  It's called the Lakin-Riley Act. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=455.82s)]
*  So Allison and Lauren, America will never ever forget our beautiful Lakin-Hope Riley. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=459.1s)]
*  Nearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Mark Fogel was detained [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=468.06s)]
*  in Russia, but last summer I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malfine, that we would [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  bring her boy safely back home. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=482.12s)]
*  My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=485.41999999999996s)]
*  Cory Comparator was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=492.35999999999996s)]
*  We're joined by Cory's wife Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=499.8s)]
*  beloved daughters, Allison and Kaylee. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=506.72s)]

*  Democrats would clap for that, would stand up, at least be bipartisan on those issues. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=583.16s)]

*  Service, we both had tears coming down our faces out of our eyes. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=595.84s)]
*  It had to be like that, at least in half of the chamber that you were in last night. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=600.84s)]
*  Yeah, people went crazy and I looked right over to the left and thought, okay, this is [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=605.4s)]
*  going to be the moment where people have to clap for a 13-year-old. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=609.08s)]
*  For a kid that was supposed to be dead at five, who's sitting there at 13 overcoming [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=612.32s)]
*  cancer, I'm like, how can you sit? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=617.2s)]
*  But instead they sat and looked indifferent. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=620.0400000000001s)]
*  Look, it's the badge. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=622.12s)]
*  I mean, to me, there was a lack of organization. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=623.12s)]
*  I mean, I don't think Hakeem Jeffries said everyone sit down and ignore kids with cancer. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=626.08s)]

*  You can't clap for the naming of a park? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=638.2800000000001s)]
*  It was astounding. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  I just think it was embarrassing, but it's also sad. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=641.8s)]
*  I mean, you have a group of people that aren't going to do anything for four years and you [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=645.0799999999999s)]
*  saw them walk away from that girls in sports bill three days ago. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=650.52s)]
*  They just didn't show up after them. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=654.8399999999999s)]
*  I saw 14 walked out. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=657.24s)]
*  Yeah, they said, look at that, 14 walked out during the ceremony. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=659.12s)]
*  17 boycotted, 14 walked out and Ted Cruz said, I have never seen such a disgraceful display [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=663.52s)]
*  as the Democrats put on. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=668.26s)]
*  I've been to 13 State of the Union addresses. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=669.72s)]
*  I've been to every one. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=672.36s)]
*  I've never missed one. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=673.36s)]
*  Every time Joe Biden walked into the chamber, I stood up and I clapped. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=674.36s)]
*  This is a radical party that is full of rage and hatred. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=677.44s)]
*  Somewhere down the line, the Democrats lost their way. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=682.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, the things that were discussed, I understand some of them were had political [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=684.52s)]
*  messages, but when you have a kid that survived cancer, they didn't even sure. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=689.96s)]
*  Maybe they did. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=694.84s)]
*  From the view of the camera, I did not see them cheer when they got the guy that killed [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=695.88s)]
*  13 Americans in Afghanistan. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=702.8000000000001s)]
*  And I mean, it's just I don't understand where they go from here. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=707.36s)]
*  This was an opportunity to put the partisanship away and just focus on those stories. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=711.52s)]
*  But they couldn't do it that night. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=717.32s)]
*  And then I saw some of the response. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=718.96s)]
*  We're going to be talking about it later on the show. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=720.2800000000001s)]
*  And DJ is going to be on the show. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=722.96s)]
*  Their explanation of why they did not clap, some in the mainstream media is lunacy. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=724.8s)]
*  You didn't have to politicize that moment at all. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=731.64s)]
*  But you got some of Nicole Wallace, who used to be a Republican, that just lost her way. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=734.8s)]
*  Rachel Maddow. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=739.72s)]
*  Rachel Maddow that said that the reason why they didn't clap or the reason why they didn't [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=740.48s)]
*  celebrate is because the president has cut cancer funding. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=745.28s)]
*  I mean, this is just nonsense. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=749.48s)]
*  Well, we just saw the little boy, the 13 year old boy officially become a Secret Service [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=751.28s)]
*  agent right after the kid who was announced that he was going to West Point. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=756.9599999999999s)]
*  The brand new Secret Service agent came over and gave him a high five. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=761.92s)]
*  It was absolutely terrific. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=765.92s)]
*  But the end DJ and his family, his father are going to be with us coming up in the eight [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=768.56s)]
*  o'clock hour of Fox and Friends. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=774.64s)]
*  And I was reading a little bit about him this morning and his story. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=776.3199999999999s)]
*  And when he found out that he was going to have he was going to die from the brain cancer, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=780.92s)]
*  he made it his quest to try to get sworn in to different police departments all across [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=785.9599999999999s)]
*  the country. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=791.04s)]
*  And in fact, right there, he is wearing the uniform of the Houston Police Department. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=791.68s)]
*  But now, of course, as he hugs Sean Curran, the director of the Secret Service, he is [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=796.5999999999999s)]
*  and look at Sean's face. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=802.4s)]
*  Look at Sean's. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=803.92s)]
*  How do you I've never seen the guy smile. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=804.76s)]
*  He was one of the guys that tackled the president when bullets were flying. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=807.76s)]
*  And it was just a beautiful moment. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=812.28s)]
*  If you have a heart, you just or child. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=814.08s)]
*  What I mean, think about what he's been through. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=815.96s)]
*  Probably chemo, radiation, surgeries and and and half the chamber. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=818.44s)]
*  The Democrats sat on their hands when that happened right there. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=823.08s)]
*  Do you have a heart? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=827.8000000000001s)]
*  They sat on their hands when they recognized the family of Lake and Riley or, you know, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=829.5600000000001s)]
*  or and Brian and Lawrence, you were talking about this when they announced the capture [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=834.76s)]
*  of the mastermind behind the 13 killed at the Kabul airport. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=839.52s)]
*  They just sat there. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=843.88s)]
*  I mean, these are wins for the not not for Republicans, right? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=844.64s)]
*  For America, for the world. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=848.52s)]
*  We didn't notice that. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=850.1999999999999s)]
*  But the overall was it was a common sense speech. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=851.0799999999999s)]
*  It was a great speech. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=854.1999999999999s)]
*  He talked about what he's going to do for America. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=855.64s)]
*  And I think we just need to give him a chance. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=857.48s)]
*  It's been five or six weeks. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=859.4s)]
*  Come on, America. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=861.12s)]
*  He also the best line was what we played at the beginning of the show when he's talking [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=862.64s)]
*  about the border. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=866.0400000000001s)]
*  The media and our friends in the Democratic Party kept saying we needed new legislation, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=866.76s)]
*  but it turns out all that we really needed was a new that was the line of the night. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=870.08s)]
*  All right. 14 minutes. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=875.64s)]
*  Brian, you want to say something? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=876.88s)]
*  Yeah, Nancy Pelosi didn't stand for that either. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=878.12s)]
*  No, that didn't surprise me. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=880.28s)]
*  It was a relaxing night for her. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=882.4s)]
*  None of them really did much. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=884.5600000000001s)]
*  And Elizabeth Warren, she caught up on all of her tax. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=886.48s)]
*  Yeah, she was called out. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoZVd7EfmbQ&t=889.12s)]
