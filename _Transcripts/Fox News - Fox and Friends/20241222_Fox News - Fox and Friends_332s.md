# Smugglers, criminal orgs 'charging double' to sneak migrants into America, warns official
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU)
*  New exclusive videos show the Texas Department of Public Safety catching suspected smugglers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=0.0s)]
*  among the latest apprehension of illegal immigrants. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=6.08s)]
*  That came after DPS found an unaccompanied 11-year-old migrant with nothing but a phone [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=8.72s)]
*  and an address at the border. Joining us now is Texas DPS Lieutenant Chris Olivares, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=35.04s)]
*  LT. It's unbelievable these videos you're sharing in the picture. There seems to be a surge [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=39.92s)]
*  of migrants trying to get across before the crackdown comes with the incoming Trump administration. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=46.32s)]
*  Right, good morning, Griff. So of course, as you know, you've been out to the borders, you know, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=54.72s)]
*  for the past four years now and even more recent, you know, when you were down there at Eagle Pass, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  Texas, we talked about these issues. We talked about these concerns where even though the numbers [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=62.24s)]
*  may be low, we're not seeing these large groups anymore by the thousands, but we are still dealing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=66.64s)]
*  with human smuggling. We are still dealing with those that want to evade capture and try to sneak [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=71.04s)]
*  into the interior, either that's by being smuggled by human smugglers or trying to sneak in through [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=75.6s)]
*  private ranches. We're having to track, you know, with our canines and our horse patrol over 10 plus [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=80.64s)]
*  miles trying to locate these individuals that are trying to sneak in. So this is a real concern to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=85.04s)]
*  us, especially as we approach January. I think the desperation is starting to settle in as many [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=90.16s)]
*  people that are trying to make their way to the United States, especially in Texas, really don't [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=95.36s)]
*  know what's going to happen. So we could see more of this human smuggling. We could see more legal [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  immigrants trying to sneak in and try to evade capture by circumventing checkpoints. But I think [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=104.72s)]
*  that video right there shows the hard work that our troopers do every single day and how they remain [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=109.52s)]
*  ready and how we are prepared for any type of surge, especially that we could see between [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=114.08s)]
*  ports of entry, but more so, you know, focusing and trying to go after these human smugglers and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=118.64s)]
*  rescuing children and also trying to avoid and deter any possible criminal activity at our southern [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=123.52s)]
*  border. And LT, when I was with you just a few weeks ago in that Maverick County, you and I were [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=129.12s)]
*  out and we saw the smugglers really trying to find open areas where they might be able to get [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=134.32s)]
*  people across. And you were telling me then, which appears to still be the case, that smugglers are [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=141.04s)]
*  benefiting more than ever financially because they're charging more. Oh, absolutely. I mean, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=146.24s)]
*  right now the human smugglers and criminal organizations in Mexico, I mean, they're using [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  these, this messaging by the new administration, by these policies that are going to take effect [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  come January, using that to their advantage to increase their profits by charging double [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=161.44s)]
*  than what they would normally charge to get people across that border. So, you know, it's a very [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=166.4s)]
*  profitable business now for these human smugglers. And I think we're starting to see more of these [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=170.24s)]
*  dangers as well as they smuggle, you know, numerous people in vehicles, especially in some of these [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=173.44s)]
*  high-speed chases where they have no regard for human life. They have no regard for the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=178.8s)]
*  motoring public as well. And that's a real concern to us as a police agency. But again, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=182.8s)]
*  you know, our troopers remain ready. We're going to continue to combat these criminal smugglers [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=188.64s)]
*  and try to take away or remove these profits from them by trying to rescue some of these [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=192.8s)]
*  illegal immigrants that are being victimized by these human smugglers. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=196.8s)]
*  LT, when you and I were there as well, we had one group on one day come through that had migrants [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=200.8s)]
*  from Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. And Tom Homan, the incoming border czar, yesterday, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=206.32s)]
*  we talked about what to do with migrants from countries like Venezuela where they don't take [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=214.4s)]
*  them back. Here's what he said. Listen. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=218.32s)]
*  ICE officers across the country are prepared to go out and target public safety threats with TDA. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=221.12s)]
*  It's on top of that public safety threat. They're going to be arrested. They're going to be detained [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=227.44000000000003s)]
*  and they're going to remove. I've been talking to several different countries. If Venezuela [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=231.28s)]
*  don't take them back, we got other countries who are stepping up and say they will. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=234.8s)]
*  That's news, LT, if other countries will take it and Venezuela won't. But just on what you're seeing [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  where you are, are you seeing an increase from countries like Venezuela [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=244.8s)]
*  and South American countries that might not have repatriation agreements? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=249.52s)]
*  LT. GEN. RONALD C. GRIFFITHS, U.S. Secretary of State for the Interior [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, we are, Griff. We are still seeing some from Venezuela, also special interest countries, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=255.12s)]
*  as well as we talked about when you were there in Eagle Pass, Texas. But that's something we do [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=258.72s)]
*  start to, we are seeing as well across the southern border in Texas. But I think going back to what [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=263.12s)]
*  the U.S. incoming border czar, Tom Homan, said, I think the messaging itself really tells these [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=268.32s)]
*  other countries that this new administration means business. And I think that's why many of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=273.36s)]
*  these countries are starting to realize that they have no other option right now but to cooperate. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=277.68s)]
*  I think that's why they're starting to now say that they're going to accept other migrants from [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=283.52s)]
*  other countries. So I think that's a big win for us. That's really going to deter the flow [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=287.2s)]
*  of mass migration taking place because now we know that we can actually deport these migrants back [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=291.68s)]
*  to not only their home country but to any other safer country that's available. So that's a big [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  win moving forward. Of course, again, they haven't even taken office yet. So I think we can see what's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=300.4s)]
*  expected in the coming year. Yeah. And it certainly seems that morale seems to be rising as well with [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=305.68s)]
*  the incoming administration. Lieutenant Chris Olivares, thank you for all the work you and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=311.76s)]
*  all the troopers do and have a Merry Christmas. Likewise, Merry Christmas, Griff. Thank you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWX3loIkxU&t=316.32s)]
