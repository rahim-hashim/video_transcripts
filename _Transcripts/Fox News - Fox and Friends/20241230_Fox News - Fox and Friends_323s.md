# Mike Johnson needs to do his 'constitutional duty' if he wants to be speaker, Rep. Spartz warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao)
*  Our next guest says she is not committed in her vote for Johnson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=0.0s)]
*  GOP congresswoman Victoria Sparks joins us now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=4.84s)]
*  Congresswoman, thanks for being with us right now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Why are you not committed to Speaker Johnson as the next speaker of the House? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=9.64s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you, Will, I look at people's track record, and unfortunately, we will not [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=14.0s)]
*  be able to deliver on President Trump's agenda as the same happened in 2016 because it has [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=19.92s)]
*  to be done legislatively if we don't have speaker with the courage, vision and the plan. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=26.1s)]
*  And if Speaker Johnson wants to be a speaker, then he needs to lay out the plan and commit [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=30.94s)]
*  to that plan, not like what he did last year. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=36.54s)]
*  He committed on the House floor to have a fiscal commission, so we have plan for that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=39.06s)]
*  ceiling increase, which President Trump is right about. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=42.58s)]
*  We have no plan. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  He was afraid to put it on the floor. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  He was afraid to put budget on the floor, except post office bill. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=47.58s)]
*  We couldn't accomplish anything. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=50.78s)]
*  So I can give him a chance, but I would like to hear from him how he's going to be delivering [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=52.660000000000004s)]
*  this agenda and what plan he has, and he hasn't been doing it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=57.06s)]
*  Okay, you're uncommitted. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=60.54s)]
*  You say you can give him a chance, and you've laid out what you want to hear from him and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=61.54s)]
*  some of your criticisms. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=65.18s)]
*  I do need to ask you, though, about strategy. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=66.18s)]
*  So if you do not commit to voting for Speaker Johnson, which, by the way, one more defection [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=69.26s)]
*  from Speaker Johnson would cost him the speakership, what do you expect to happen? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=75.7s)]
*  Do you have a name? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=81.76s)]
*  Do you have somebody that you would like to be Speaker? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=82.76s)]
*  I actually want to hear, you know, what people, other people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=84.56s)]
*  Speaker Johnson is not able to govern and is not actually willing to commit to do his [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=89.04s)]
*  constitutional duty. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=94.04s)]
*  I'm not asking him to do anything beyond what Constitution asks. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=95.4s)]
*  We have a Titanic on the crash course with the iceberg, and our country fiscally is going [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=100.0s)]
*  to have a disaster, and this is the fault of Congress. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  This is our constitutional duty. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  If he's not willing to do it, then he's not worth to be a speaker. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=111.62s)]
*  We can, any American can be a speaker, and I'm willing to hear other people, too. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=114.5s)]
*  But if Speaker Johnson, I said it again, if he wants to be a speaker, he needs to commit [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=118.9s)]
*  publicly how he's going to be fulfilling his constitutional duties. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  I'm not asking him go beyond what he has to do by Constitution and what structures we [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=128.82s)]
*  need to put in place to get out of this mess. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=134.58s)]
*  I think I hear clearly what you hope, what you expect from Speaker Johnson in order to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=136.9s)]
*  get your vote. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=142.46s)]
*  But if he does not do what you want him to do in order to earn your vote, no one else [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=143.86s)]
*  has stepped up. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=149.54000000000002s)]
*  So it leaves the House of Representatives with no leadership for some protracted period [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=150.70000000000002s)]
*  of time where Donald Trump is looking to be inaugurated within a few weeks. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=154.94s)]
*  Well, listen, I think there are a lot of other people that are interested, you know, but [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=158.78s)]
*  I think they don't want at this point to go to Speaker Johnson. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=163.5s)]
*  And I think Speaker Johnson needs to have a serious conversation, and I hope he will [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  be able to have that conversation, including with President Trump, and convince him, because [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  there are a few things also he didn't deliver for President Trump, too, what he promised [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=176.17999999999998s)]
*  just recently. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  And he needs to be able to convince the American people that he able to do it, and other members. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=182.01999999999998s)]
*  So there are other people who, but right now, no one wants to step up and say, well, yeah, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=186.72s)]
*  Mike hasn't been doing that great, but you know, we don't want to, since he's been saying [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=192.58s)]
*  all these good things to the President. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=197.14s)]
*  So I think that's notable if you're telling us you know of other individuals in Congress [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=199.38s)]
*  who would want to put themselves up for Speaker. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=203.26s)]
*  Yes, they are, of course. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=205.46s)]
*  There's a lot of people probably, you know, and I think that's a debate operation we have, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=207.46s)]
*  and I hope we have it before January 6. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=211.46s)]
*  This is unfortunate that Speaker Johnson is not willing to have that deliberation with [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=214.1s)]
*  the members that actually oppose him right now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=218.66000000000003s)]
*  And it's not just me. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=222.06s)]
*  There's much more members. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=223.06s)]
*  A lot of people just really afraid to say that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=227.54000000000002s)]
*  So last question for you then, though, if this does not come together in a time frame [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=228.54000000000002s)]
*  where it is something that happens quickly and based upon history, it has not happened [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=233.82000000000002s)]
*  quickly, this could be something that interrupts the inauguration of Donald Trump as President [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=238.10000000000002s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=242.06s)]
*  It could in fact mean, as has been pointed out by Fox's Chad Pergram, that it becomes [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=243.38000000000002s)]
*  interim. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=247.62s)]
*  The presidency flows to Chuck Grassley currently of the Senate if Donald Trump's not capable [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=248.62s)]
*  of being inaugurated because there's no Speaker of the House. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=254.06s)]
*  Is that something you're prepared for in order for this fight over Speaker Johnson? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=256.66s)]
*  No, it's not going to happen. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=261.66s)]
*  We will have a Speaker and there are a lot of great people that be willing to step up [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=263.66s)]
*  if Speaker Johnson cannot work with the members and convince them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=267.46s)]
*  I think most people just want to have some courage and leadership and really him follow [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=270.98s)]
*  through on some promises that he didn't. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=275.5s)]
*  So I think if he doesn't want to do it, then he cannot govern this institution because [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=278.38s)]
*  you can be a Speaker, but how are you going to govern if you don't have trust of members [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=282.62s)]
*  and a very, very tight majority? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=286.06s)]
*  You need to work with people. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=287.82s)]
*  So we will have a Speaker. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=289.74s)]
*  I have no doubt about that and we will have a good Speaker. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=290.74s)]
*  But I think Speaker needs to have commitments to the American people to deliver on the agenda [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=293.82s)]
*  because if we legislate and govern through executive orders, it's going to be very short [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=298.1s)]
*  leave all of these great things that President Trump is trying to deliver for the people. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=302.78s)]
*  Okay, well thanks for explaining your point of view this morning with this congresswoman. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=306.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=310.86s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8SZzT52Ao&t=311.86s)]
