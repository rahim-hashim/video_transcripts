# Noem, Angel families bring message to blue state governor's doorstep
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0)
*  So, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, under pressure with DHS Secretary Christy Noem and Angel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=0.0s)]
*  families, push him to end the state sanctuary's policies. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=6.2s)]
*  I'm calling on Governor Pritzker and all the other leaders of this state to abandon their [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=11.48s)]
*  dangerous sanctuary policies. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=16.2s)]
*  People who support sanctuary policies talk about love and compassion. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=18.6s)]
*  Well, where's the compassion for the families that stand behind me? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=22.76s)]
*  I just call on Governor Pritzker to be a true governor and stand by the federal laws and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=26.16s)]
*  deport every one of them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=33.08s)]
*  Every one of them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=34.38s)]
*  I don't care if they're two or 20 or 80. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=35.68s)]
*  Send them back. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=38.8s)]
*  Borders Our Tom Homan joins me for a reaction. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=39.8s)]
*  What is he doing? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  I mean, I've seen these council meetings full of minorities that are saying, look, you've [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  got to end these sanctuary policies. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=50.92s)]
*  But he's doubling down. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=53.04s)]
*  No focus on the victims. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=54.24s)]
*  Well, he continues to lie about sanctuary city status in the state, and Chicago especially. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=55.32s)]
*  Look, one of the first places I went to after President Trump took the oath of office was [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=61.2s)]
*  Chicago. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=66.12s)]
*  And the first day we arrested like nine TDA members. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=67.48s)]
*  We arrested two illegal aliens that were convicted of murder that were walking the streets. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=70.48s)]
*  We arrested, I think it was six or seven child predators, child rapists in Chicago. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  And these people are all walking the street because Cook County, Cook County Jail, one [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  of the biggest jails in the nation, won't accept ICE tenets and won't work with ICE. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=83.76s)]
*  This is what he had to say in response to the president. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=88.36s)]
*  Unlike Donald Trump and Kristi Noy, who follows the law, the Trump administration is violating [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=91.08000000000001s)]
*  the United States Constitution, denying people due process and disappearing law abiding neighbors, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=95.92s)]
*  including children who are US citizens. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=102.2s)]
*  Yet they are taking no real action to promote public safety and deport violent criminals [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=103.92s)]
*  within the clear and defined legal process. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=108.76s)]
*  This is not true as well. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=111.64s)]
*  No, it's insulting to the men and women of ICE, insulting to the men and women of the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=112.84s)]
*  Board of Jail. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=116.0s)]
*  President Trump's been clear from day one, we won't concentrate on public safety threats [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=117.0s)]
*  and national security threats. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=120.52s)]
*  I just listed to you in one day what we took off the streets of Chicago. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=121.92s)]
*  And I'm sick and tired of hearing about deporting US citizen children. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=126.88s)]
*  We deported illegal aliens who had a US citizen child that requested the child go with her. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=130.12s)]
*  The mother wanted her child to go with her. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=137.12s)]
*  So we did it as the mother wished. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=139.56s)]
*  That's parenting one on one. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=140.84s)]
*  If we wouldn't have done it, then the story would be we're separating families. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=142.28s)]
*  We're trying to keep families separate. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=145.16s)]
*  Well, and they keep also mentioning these cases where people get detained. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=146.16s)]
*  That happens every day in America. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=149.96s)]
*  If there's a stop, whether it's a traffic stop, people get detained, officers assess [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=151.96s)]
*  the situation, and then they release them. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=156.08s)]
*  It's just standard operating procedure. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=158.32s)]
*  I want to bring you to this New York migrants shelter that has become a hotbed for criminal [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=160.28s)]
*  activity. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=165.44s)]
*  We're learning some of the suspects here. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=166.44s)]
*  You got over 3,000 migrants living in New York City shelters that were arrested, almost [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=168.92s)]
*  5,000 total arrests. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=174.6s)]
*  You got 1,200 for petty theft, 544 for assault, 497 for selling or possession of drugs, and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=177.04s)]
*  then 141 for sex crimes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  These are the people that we know about. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  This doesn't include the Godaways. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=189.0s)]
*  It doesn't include the people that don't have arrest warrants out. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=190.72s)]
*  But these are people that we know so far that have been doing criminal activity in our city. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  We've done several large operations. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=199.28s)]
*  We're going to do more. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=201.28s)]
*  I'm up for it right now to deal with some of these problems. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=202.28s)]
*  So we're not going to end. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=205.08s)]
*  We're not going to rest until every criminal illegal alien is out of the state of New York, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=206.08s)]
*  specifically New York City. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=211.32s)]
*  Kristi Nolan's been up here several times. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  She's coming back. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=214.8s)]
*  We're going to do our job despite the city council who wants to continue putting roadblocks [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=215.8s)]
*  up in the agreement that me and Mayor Adams has to get Wreckers Island. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=221.0s)]
*  We're up here two weeks ago. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=224.8s)]
*  We talked about 27 TDA members that were indicted to a RICO investigation, murder for hire, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=226.04s)]
*  drug trafficking, gun trafficking, sex trafficking. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=233.16s)]
*  We showed what we could do, ICE and NYPD working together. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=235.56s)]
*  But Tom, what about these kids? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=238.28s)]
*  They were part of the shelter. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=239.68s)]
*  You got 12-year-old, 14-year-old. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=240.84s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=243.8s)]
*  Why do they recruit the kids to do these crimes? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=245.22s)]
*  That's native to the homeland, right? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=249.12s)]
*  When you're 14, 15, you're military agents in some of these countries. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=251.68s)]
*  But even the kids, we're looking for them too. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=255.6s)]
*  If you're in this country illegally, you got a problem. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=258.08s)]
*  But if you're committing a crime, especially if you're going to attack an armed law enforcement [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=260.12s)]
*  officer, then you're in extreme danger to an armed civilian. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=263.4s)]
*  They're our target. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=267.04s)]
*  They're our priority, and we're looking for them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=268.04s)]
*  Tom, you're going to be named the National Police Defense Foundation, named you as the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=270.12s)]
*  Man of the Year. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=275.92s)]
*  Congratulations on the award. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=277.2s)]
*  What does this mean to you? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=279.12s)]
*  I know it's something that you're proud of. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=280.56s)]
*  You served almost, I think, 40 years in law enforcement. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=282.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'm old. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=284.76s)]
*  They gave me the award last night, and I was humbled by it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=285.76s)]
*  But I'll tell you what I told them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=289.04s)]
*  I'm going to take the award on behalf of President Trump. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=290.8s)]
*  If there's a Man of the Year, it's President Trump. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=292.76s)]
*  The reason we're having so much stress on the border and interior enforcement, because [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=295.48s)]
*  of President Trump. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=299.0s)]
*  Border Patrol couldn't do what they're doing if it wasn't for President Trump. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=300.0s)]
*  ICE couldn't do what they're doing if it wasn't for President Trump. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=302.92s)]
*  So I took it in honor of President Trump, who I think is the Man of the Year. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=305.88s)]
*  I also took it in respect for the men and women of ICE and the men and women of Border [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=308.72s)]
*  Patrol who are on the street with a gun strapped to the hip, 24-7, protective nation. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=312.6s)]
*  They deserve the award, so I took it on their behalf. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=317.6s)]
*  Why are you still doing law enforcement? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=319.56s)]
*  I mean, they've been demonized. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  You've got to have security because people are threatening your life. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=324.36s)]
*  Why still do this job? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=327.6s)]
*  Because I love my country, and I'm working for the greatest president of my lifetime. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=328.88000000000005s)]
*  I don't care if people like him or love him. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=333.6s)]
*  No one's done more than President Trump's the most secure nation. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=335.48s)]
*  He was a success during his first administration, unprecedented success. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=338.32s)]
*  We had the most secure border in a lifetime handed to Joe Biden, who destroyed it on purpose. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=341.24s)]
*  That pissed me off for four years. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=346.28s)]
*  So when President Trump asked me to come back for the second time, I didn't hesitate. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=348.04s)]
*  And look what President Trump, we got the most secure border in the history of the state [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=352.2s)]
*  right now, and he did that in seven weeks, that Joe Biden couldn't or wouldn't do in [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=356.2s)]
*  four years. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=360.6s)]
*  So true. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=361.6s)]
*  Tom Homan, thanks, brother. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGspxiS-MM0&t=362.6s)]
