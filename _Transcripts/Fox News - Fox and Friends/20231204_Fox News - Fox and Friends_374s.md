# 'Squad' Dem's CNN interview draws outrage: 'I'm so sick of this'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk)
*  And Dana Bash, a host at CNN, she was interviewing Pramila Jayapal, the Democrat from Washington, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=0.0s)]
*  and she's a progressive Democrat. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=7.84s)]
*  And Dana was asking her, how do you, you know, what do you think of the sexual violence against [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=9.88s)]
*  the Israeli women? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=14.08s)]
*  Here's her response. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=15.64s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=16.64s)]
*  I've condemned what Hamas has done. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=17.64s)]
*  I've condemned all of the actions. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=20.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=22.72s)]
*  The rape, the, of course. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=23.72s)]
*  Morally, I think we cannot say that one war crime deserves another. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=26.44s)]
*  That is not what international humanitarian law says. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=30.8s)]
*  Okay, with respect, I was just asking about the women, and you turned it back to Israel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=33.8s)]
*  I'm asking you about Hamas, in fact. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=40.08s)]
*  I already answered your question, Dana. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=41.8s)]
*  I said it's horrific, and I think that rape is horrific, sexual assault is horrific. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=43.56s)]
*  I think that it happens in war situations. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  Most organizations like Hamas, obviously, are using these as tools. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=52.4s)]
*  However, I think we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinians. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=56.8s)]
*  15,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes, three quarters of whom are women [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=65.12s)]
*  and children. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=72.92s)]
*  And it's horrible, but you don't see Israeli soldiers raping Palestinian women. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=73.92s)]
*  Well, Dana, I think we're not, we're not, I don't want this to be the hierarchy of oppression. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=77.68s)]
*  I mean, a lot of kudos to Dana Bash. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=82.48s)]
*  I mean, there's some people at her network that haven't been as forceful. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=85.12s)]
*  There's some people at other networks that haven't been forceful, and she's the chair [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=88.56s)]
*  of the progressive, the Congresswoman, the Progressive Caucus. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=92.36000000000001s)]
*  The question is, and I want people to really think about this, for months now, for years, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=96.28s)]
*  actually, we've heard about women's rights. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=102.48s)]
*  We've heard about equal justice. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=105.0s)]
*  We've heard about treating people by the content of, we've seen marches in the streets. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=106.66s)]
*  And there is an entire campaign of hate toward Jewish people, and the same outrage, the same [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=112.02s)]
*  condemnation is not being projected. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  So the question we must ask ourselves, why is it? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=122.06s)]
*  There's only one thing that is different. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=124.82s)]
*  It is that they're Jewish. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=126.34s)]
*  And I think it was great of Dana Bash to press the Congresswoman. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=128.34s)]
*  Stay focused here. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=132.01999999999998s)]
*  I keep telling people, I'm so sick of this both-side thing, Steve, because there's not [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=133.14s)]
*  both sides. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  The comparison to say, okay, Hamas did this, and the Israelis responding to the war crimes [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=139.01999999999998s)]
*  of Hamas, that should be the focus of all people here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=145.73999999999998s)]
*  You know, and a couple weeks ago, the U.S. House of Representatives, one of the first [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=151.29999999999998s)]
*  things the new speaker did was he introduced a resolution condemning Hamas. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=154.66s)]
*  She did not vote for it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  She voted present instead. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=162.54s)]
*  What happened on October 7th, you know, it redefines evil. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=165.57999999999998s)]
*  And you know, we know that people were murdered, and we know that women were raped after they [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  were murdered, which is just so disgusting. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=176.38s)]
*  But here's the thing, the raping of Israeli women, hostages, continues to this day. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=179.38s)]
*  And so it was a great question that Dana put to her, and what does she do? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=185.78s)]
*  She does the both-sides-ism where it's like, okay, well, of course, it's terrible, and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=189.98s)]
*  I've denounced it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=194.73999999999998s)]
*  She hadn't really denounced it that vocally. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=195.73999999999998s)]
*  Instead, rather than denouncing Hamas, she's talking about the Palestinian people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=198.54s)]
*  You've got to denounce Hamas, period, because that is a source of evil, and that is what [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=204.45999999999998s)]
*  Israel is working to do to wipe Hamas off the face of the earth. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=210.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=214.62s)]
*  It's a terrorist organization, and what they did to those women and those children, it [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=215.62s)]
*  is, you're right, it is evil. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=219.14000000000001s)]
*  Still doing it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=220.14000000000001s)]
*  Evil. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=221.14000000000001s)]
*  Still doing it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=223.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, we have to be clear also, Ainsley. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  We still have people that are still, I saw the footage, still denying that it even happened. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  We still have people saying that the hostages really don't exist. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=230.18s)]
*  You have one of the Hamas terrorists saying that they were just visitors. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=234.02s)]
*  I mean, that's the type of propaganda that we're dealing with. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=238.94s)]
*  So when we speak forcefully against it, this is why. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=242.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't understand how anyone can deny it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=246.54000000000002s)]
*  We have it on video. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=249.42000000000002s)]
*  You've seen the video. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=250.74s)]
*  You sat through all of that and you watched and you explained what you saw the next morning [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=252.66000000000003s)]
*  when you were at the UN. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=256.90000000000003s)]
*  I think you went to the UN to go see that video, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=257.90000000000003s)]
*  I mean, here's some of the video. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=259.66s)]
*  Trey Ynxt is over there and has seen it for himself. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=260.66s)]
*  He went into one of those houses and he showed us all the blood on the floor that was trailing [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=263.7s)]
*  out of the safe room after they had annihilated a family in there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=268.02s)]
*  So the images are real, and even Hamas is putting these images on social media. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=271.5s)]
*  So they're not denying it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=276.12s)]
*  Yeah, more people. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=278.52s)]
*  Everybody needs to call out Hamas for what they're doing to Israelis and women. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=281.0s)]
*  And we don't want anyone to die. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=285.92s)]
*  We don't want civilians to die. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=286.92s)]
*  But Israel's handled this completely different. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=288.0s)]
*  Israel was dropping pamphlets down saying, move to the south. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=290.2s)]
*  If you live in this neighborhood, we're coming in soon. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=293.32s)]
*  We're warning you, move. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=295.76s)]
*  Did Hamas do that to Israel? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=297.32s)]
*  No, they were at concerts. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=298.96s)]
*  They were eating breakfast with their families. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=300.54s)]
*  They were at the dinner table. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=303.0s)]
*  And these strangers come in and slit throats and put babies in the oven. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=304.0s)]
*  They handled it completely different and raped the women. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=309.08s)]
*  And that's what Dana Bash was saying to her. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  You need to condemn this violence because the Hamas is fighting at a different level. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=313.44s)]
*  It is very simple. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=318.4s)]
*  If you want civilians, if you want women and children to stop dying in the Gaza Strip, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=319.97999999999996s)]
*  then stop using a mess shield. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=324.76s)]
*  Fight like men. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  You brought this on yourself on October the 7th. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=328.44s)]
*  Israel is in the middle of a hunt to hunt you down. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=331.52s)]
*  Stop using women and children as shields. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=333.88s)]
*  And the only reason Israel is doing this is they don't want it to happen again. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  They're trying to eradicate this terrorist organization who has said, we're coming in [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=338.35999999999996s)]
*  a second time, a third time, a fourth time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=342.0s)]
*  And Lawrence, to your point, it's hard to stop using women and children as shields when [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=344.2s)]
*  you put your headquarters under a hospital. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  And today, Trey Yenston's got the news that apparently there were 200 strikes against [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=351.56s)]
*  Hamas targets overnight. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=356.4s)]
*  What did they do? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=357.64s)]
*  The Israelis went into a school where they find their tunnels. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=360.28s)]
*  One of the tunnels full of weapons and the other tunnel booby trapped so that when the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=363.88s)]
*  Israelis open the door, everything blows up. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=368.2s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=370.88s)]
*  We continue to pray for our friends in Israel. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB3rlEyt8Gk&t=371.88s)]
