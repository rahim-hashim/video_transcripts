# 'IMPLODING': Senate candidate says move by vunerable Dems is telling for Kamala Harris
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8)
*  And that's why I wrote a law signed by President Trump forcing drug companies to show their [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=0.0s)]
*  actual prices. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=8.58s)]
*  Democrat Michigan Senate candidate hyping up her ties to Donald Trump in that campaign [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=12.02s)]
*  had as a new op-ed warns her own progressive baggage could cost her the seat in this crucial [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=17.14s)]
*  swing state. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  Our opponent Michigan GOP Senate candidate Mike Rogers joins us now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=25.9s)]
*  Great to see you this morning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=29.54s)]
*  So I'm just I'm spitballing here but I'm thinking you have not issued an ad tying yourself [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=32.26s)]
*  to Kamala Harris in Michigan. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=39.08s)]
*  That's just I'm just guessing that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=40.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  Pretty pretty good guess. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  You know and what's the interesting thing is we're seeing this in other Senate races. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  Wisconsin they're coming out showing Trump's Trump's face in a Democrat ad. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=48.82s)]
*  And I'm just wondering with Casey in Pennsylvania I think this tells you their candidate Kamala [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=53.18s)]
*  Harris is imploding. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=58.46s)]
*  People are starting to understand that she just really doesn't know what in the heck [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  she's doing and that progressive agenda is going to kill states like Michigan banning [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=64.18s)]
*  gas cars and gas stoves and allowing biological males to compete against our daughters. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=70.14s)]
*  All of those things they've been promoting and voting on until election season. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=75.9s)]
*  Now they have you know I call it campaign conversion where they think well there's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=79.82s)]
*  we've got to go a different direction and they're the ones to get it done. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=85.66s)]
*  So we're I mean our race is right where we need them to be. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=88.82s)]
*  If they're starting to talk about Donald Trump I think we're going to win. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=93.05999999999999s)]
*  Yeah well the latest polling in Michigan by the way your opponents Lutkin at 49 percent [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=95.82s)]
*  you have 46 percent. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  Talk to me about why this is even so close. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  I mean when you talk about what this would do to the auto industry I've been seeing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=106.42s)]
*  that even the Muslim community not happy with Kamala because she doesn't seem to know what [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=111.06s)]
*  she's going to do there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=116.02s)]
*  Sort of like she's talking on both sides of her mouth. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=118.14s)]
*  So what's happening and why is it this close. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=120.54s)]
*  Well and our internals even have it closer candidly. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=125.1s)]
*  Two things one we have I think an unprecedented ground game in the state probably the best [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=128.22s)]
*  in the country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=133.16s)]
*  Just last weekend we hit 40000 doors across the state of Michigan. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=134.86s)]
*  Huge impact. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=139.74s)]
*  That's what's keeping us in the race talking about real issues. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=140.74s)]
*  The EV mandate is going to kill the auto company. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=144.02s)]
*  Just think about the EV mandates that have already happened. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=146.62s)]
*  And remember there's a five year planning cycle for these automobiles. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=149.70000000000002s)]
*  Stellantis just announced 2400 layoffs General Motors 1000 layoffs Ford said they had to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=153.94s)]
*  Which means they lost five billion dollars in their EV division. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=160.46s)]
*  People don't want to buy the car that Kamala Harris and my opponent Alyssa Slotkin are [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=166.58s)]
*  trying to make you have to buy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=170.98000000000002s)]
*  And so that is having a tremendous negative impact here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=172.78s)]
*  We've lost 29000 manufacturing jobs just in the last four years here in the state of Michigan. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  It's been brutal. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=182.8s)]
*  And so I know they come back at election time and say no no no we're the moderate and oh [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=184.4s)]
*  by the way I talked to Donald Trump on an occasion. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  This is about a serious and economic problem for our people here in Michigan who are having [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=191.98000000000002s)]
*  a hard time buying groceries than I've ever seen. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=197.5s)]
*  And so people get it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  The auto worker coalition for the Democrats falling apart the Arab Muslim coalition for [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=201.10000000000002s)]
*  the Democrats falling apart and black males are coming over to the Republican Party in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=205.10000000000002s)]
*  numbers we just haven't ever seen before. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  Congressman I want to ask you this really quickly because you're a former chair of the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=210.9s)]
*  House Intel committee and I think this is an important story we're going to be paying [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=214.38000000000002s)]
*  attention to. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  I think there's been reports that need to be confirmed but that there is a leak. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=218.66s)]
*  There has been a leak of intelligence on Israel's plans to hit Iran in retaliation to the October [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=223.94s)]
*  attack on Israel. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=229.89999999999998s)]
*  Now this isn't totally removed from the campaign or the current sitting administration perhaps [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=232.62s)]
*  we'll have to see. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=236.78s)]
*  But this seems like a serious potential leak. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=237.78s)]
*  Listen and I hate to say this. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=240.33999999999997s)]
*  I've seen this movie before and it's the same people who are in the national security [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=243.33999999999997s)]
*  that were there during Obama and there was also a massive leak back then on Israeli plans [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=248.82s)]
*  to take out the nuclear sites in Iran. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=255.82s)]
*  And the reason they do that they have this odd love affair with Iran in this administration. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=258.98s)]
*  And I think it has engulfed the Middle East in fighting. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=265.18s)]
*  Number one and number two they continually try to degrade our military capability of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=269.1s)]
*  one of our best allies in the region which is Israel. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=273.42s)]
*  I hope they investigate it fully but again this is now to me once it can happen this [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=277.42s)]
*  is now a pattern of activity to undermine Israel's ability to defend itself and I think [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=284.42s)]
*  that's about as serious an event as you can get when it comes to somebody who's now fighting [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  a two front war which is Israel. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=294.5s)]
*  That's a perfect description. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=296.82000000000005s)]
*  It is a weird love affair with Iran. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=297.86s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=299.86s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=300.86s)]
*  Thanks for being with us Congressman this morning. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=301.86s)]
*  Thanks to a lot. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=303.86s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=304.86s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=305.86s)]
*  Got it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJ3CzEmzW8&t=306.86s)]
