# Peter Doocy: This will be a big headache for Biden
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw)
*  happening today. President Biden will deliver a big address on anti-Semitism in this country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=0.0s)]
*  Every time we asked him why he wasn't speaking, they say big address coming at the National [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=5.36s)]
*  Holocaust Memorial Museum on May 7th. And you can see Peter Doocy, he joins us live. He's at the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=10.16s)]
*  White House. Hey Peter. And we have brand new evidence that a lot of these protesters are [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=14.4s)]
*  ignoring President Biden's calls to remain peaceful and they are ignoring his statement [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=19.2s)]
*  that there is no place for hate speech in this country because last night right outside the Met [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=23.92s)]
*  Gala in New York City, the NYPD were being taunted with chants of KKK. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=29.04s)]
*  And you look at this video, it's still happening even though White House officials have told [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=53.28s)]
*  protesters police are only going to get involved in their demonstrations if laws are being broken. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=57.6s)]
*  There's also still a huge mess at MIT where authorities successfully cleared out an [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  encampment on campus only to watch protesters come back and re-occupy it hours later. President [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=68.72s)]
*  Biden's remarks today are likely not going to satisfy protesters hoping the U.S. stops [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=75.6s)]
*  supporting Israel because his remarks today are at a Capitol Hill event marking Holocaust [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Remembrance Day. And we do expect officials to fill us in a little bit more about how U.S. support [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=85.84s)]
*  for Israel's military has or has not changed now that the IDF has defied Biden calls not to go into [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  Rafa. At least we expect to get some more info than we got from the Vice President while she [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=98.72s)]
*  was carrying leftovers. Madam Vice President, Hamas says it accepted a ceasefire deal. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=104.4s)]
*  Hamas has accepted a ceasefire deal. Your reaction? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  People on both sides of this debate probably pretty surprised to hear that the official U.S. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=115.44s)]
*  position on the ceasefire deal at least for a time was shrimp and grits. Back to you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=119.36s)]
*  Peter, you know ultimately while we're looking at all these protests across the country at campuses [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=126.72s)]
*  and in the streets of New York City and everything else, it's all about one thing and it's about [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=132.24s)]
*  trying to pressure Joe Biden to change his stance regarding Israel. You know, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=137.2s)]
*  a lot of the protesters do not like the fact that we are Israel's greatest ally. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=144.16s)]
*  Is there any suggestion that he's going to address that today and change U.S. policy [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=148.48s)]
*  or are they just going to leave that on the unsaid? No, but something that when we were [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  looking at that live picture from the University of Chicago a few minutes ago, I'm sure that a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=159.92s)]
*  lot of the people that we see on campus today are going to be repeat customers at the DNC [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=163.6s)]
*  convention this summer and I'm sure it's going to be a big headache for the Biden-Harris ticket. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=168.32s)]
*  The thing is these protesters are not pushing another candidate and they're not out there saying [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=172.88s)]
*  well we want Trump. So they are causing a lot of problems but in terms of like affecting the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  nominating process, they're probably going to try to make it really really difficult for delegates [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=185.92s)]
*  to get around and I'm sure that there will be interruptions on the floor but they're not [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=189.84s)]
*  organizing around another person to try to put somebody else in there, a Democrat who would [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=195.6s)]
*  not have such strong support for Israel. So it seems like the preference is to try to make a point [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=203.52s)]
*  by causing problems, by causing chaos for everybody as opposed to trying to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=209.6s)]
*  operate within some kind of a normal process. Well the chaos is working. Peter, how do they decide [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=216.0s)]
*  where they're going to have the conventions? Because Republican, Milwaukee, Chicago, DNC in August, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=220.56s)]
*  I would think that Republicans would have it in a probably a southern state, is it because these [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  swing states? They need the swing states. They need the swing states. A lot of it is logistics and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  lobbying. So the powerful Democrats from Chicago lobbied the DNC, they wanted the convention, they [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  hosted executives and the people who decide and then also you need to go to a place that just has [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=242.8s)]
*  the week that they want to have it that has available hotel rooms and a convention center [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=248.56s)]
*  and so it's more logistical than anything else. New York has all their illegal immigrants in [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=252.0s)]
*  hotel rooms so we're out of the running. Thanks Peter. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O1fPw6Yylw&t=256.72s)]
