# Israel could inflict massive damage on Iran: Sen. Tom Cotton
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0)
*  The Biden-Harris administration says the U.S. is standing by its ally. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=0.0s)]
*  We are proud of the actions that we've taken alongside Israel to protect and defend Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=5.88s)]
*  We have made clear that there will be consequences, severe consequences for this attack, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=10.38s)]
*  and we will work with Israel to make that the case. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  But it's tough talk, really working here to react, Senator Tom Cotton. Senator, your reaction to what we've done, knocking down at least ten [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=17.06s)]
*  missiles heading towards [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=24.6s)]
*  Israel last night, but they knocked over the bulk of it themselves. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=26.34s)]
*  Sure. Well, it's important that the United States support Israel to defend against missile attacks, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=29.319999999999997s)]
*  but that's defense, and you can't win wars on the defense. Israel is in a multi-front war [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=34.04s)]
*  against Iran and its ring of fire. Now, yesterday the veil dropped when Iran attacked Israel for the second time this year directly, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=39.4s)]
*  but Hamas is backed by Iran, Hezbollah is fully backed by Iran, Iran has a terror army in Yemen that shootings missiles at Israel. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=46.68s)]
*  Israel, though, has a chance after its accomplishments against Hezbollah in the last three weeks to totally [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=54.32s)]
*  remake the strategic map in the Middle East. Hezbollah has over 100,000 missiles and rockets. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=59.12s)]
*  That's been like a loaded gun pointed at Israel's head for years. That's been Iran's main deterrent. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=64.92s)]
*  But because Israel so thoroughly penetrated Hezbollah, because it's decapitated Hezbollah's leadership, now, by some reports, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  it's destroyed over half of that arsenal. It has a chance to totally expose Iran on its flanks. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=77.72s)]
*  The United States needs to back Israel to the hilt. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=83.8s)]
*  That's the opposite of what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have done for the last year, putting more pressure on Israel than they do on Iran's terror network. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=86.52s)]
*  Nobody wants a world war. We have huge assets in the area, but no one has to tell you, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=93.72s)]
*  Senator Cotton, that Iran is behind the attacks, the militias. They killed three of our guys in Syria. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=98.84s)]
*  We never avenged them. They've shut down the Red Sea, shooting at our ships with their drones, $100 drones for a million dollar [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=105.16s)]
*  defensive rockets. We have allowed this to happen. They're shooting at us. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=113.64s)]
*  Our ally is under attack at the same people that are shooting at us. Should we be doing more? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=118.84s)]
*  Yeah, Brian, we're not going to have a world war. Iran has been exposed as something of a brittle military [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  and a fickle ally. I think there's a lot of people sitting [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=130.68s)]
*  in Hamas and Hezbollah in Yemen wondering why has Iran not done more? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=133.96s)]
*  Why, when they struck Israel yesterday for the second time in six months, could they not kill a single Israeli or blow up a single critical facility in Israel? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=137.72s)]
*  Again, Iran has been exposed on its flanks right now. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=146.2s)]
*  Israel has a chance to inflict massive retaliatory damage on Iran and remake the map of the Middle East. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  That's good not only for Israel, it's good for us and our interests and our citizens in the region. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=156.68s)]
*  It's good for all of our Arab allies. You may have noticed, did not say a single word critical of Israel yesterday. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=161.32s)]
*  As it was saying that it's going to strike back against Iran. We have a historic window. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=167.32s)]
*  We'll see if he's going to take it maybe to decapitate the Iranian regime whose people hate them and would love for us to be there for him. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=171.56s)]
*  Yesterday, one of the things that stood out was when Governor Walz was asked about [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  where he was when Tienanmen Square and the uprising there with the beat down of the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=183.48s)]
*  of the citizens. He said he was there. It was exposed that he was not there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=187.96s)]
*  He says he misspoke and that sometimes he's a knucklehead. Is that okay? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=193.32s)]
*  No, I mean, I think it's been clear now that he's had a serial embellishments about his record. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=199.0s)]
*  What troubles me more about where he was in the summer of 1989 [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=204.68s)]
*  is the repeated trips he's taken to China over the years. Dozens of trips to China, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  many of which were funded by the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  This is a classic effort that Chinese communists use to groom and cultivate [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=216.28s)]
*  Americans who may move on to leadership. And look what's happened. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=220.67999999999998s)]
*  He went from being a high school history or civics teacher to becoming a congressman and now he's the vice president. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=223.56s)]
*  He needs to explain to the American people a lot more about what his relationship was with China over the last three decades [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=229.48s)]
*  and why he just coincidentally took such a soft line on Chinese communism in Congress and as governor. You're saying he's compromised? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=235.64s)]
*  I'm saying that this is a classic pattern of how China tries to cultivate American leaders at the lowest levels, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=242.44s)]
*  turn them into a China lobby for their federal [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=249.16s)]
*  representatives in Washington and then if they become one of those representatives or become a governor then China has hit the jackpot. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=252.5s)]
*  And remember the guy a spy here was consulting with the governor of New York and we know one was dating Erics Walwell. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=258.28s)]
*  Great to see you Senator. Thank you and we look forward to seeing you again soon. I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0&t=265.32s)]
