# Kamala Harris to again ignore border crisis on 4th trip to Arizona
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU)
*  Well, Kamala Harris is in Phoenix, Arizona today, her fourth visit to the state this year, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=0.0s)]
*  without making a single trip to the southern border. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=4.8s)]
*  The state's Tucson sector has reported more than 480,000 illegal encounters this fiscal year, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=8.6s)]
*  by far the most of any border sector. Remember, that's just one sector. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=16.6s)]
*  How much longer can Harris ignore this crisis? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=22.6s)]
*  Chris Clem, retired Border Patrol Chief Agent in Yuma, Arizona, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=25.1s)]
*  is here to react. Chris, it's great to have you on. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=29.200000000000003s)]
*  I was reading a report by another border chief who was saying, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=32.2s)]
*  you know, the name Kamala Harris actually elicits eye rolls out of Border Patrol agents [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=35.2s)]
*  and border law enforcement because everything has just gotten worse since she became the quote, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=41.2s)]
*  borders are. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=46.2s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the numbers don't lie. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=48.2s)]
*  We went from 900,000 to 400,000 up to 1.6 million, 2.2 million, and so on and so on. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=50.7s)]
*  The fact that she's been to a border state or she is currently in a border state [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=57.300000000000004s)]
*  and not actually going to the physical border and meeting with her own Border Patrol leadership [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  or border area law enforcement is adding insult to injury. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=67.3s)]
*  And as we speak about Tucson sector, I live in Tucson sector now, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=71.3s)]
*  it has consistently been one of the highest sectors for many, many years [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=75.30000000000001s)]
*  and always has been consistently the highest for gotaways. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=79.30000000000001s)]
*  And when I was chief in Yuma dealing with the lion's share of activity, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=83.30000000000001s)]
*  they had to bear the burden of processing a lot of the migrants and people we caught [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  because we were just so overwhelmed by the failed policies of this administration. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  What is very telling, Rachel, I'll just say this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  It's where she's been. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  It's where she is right now on border security immigration. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  And it's definitely where her future will be if she remains in office. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=103.4s)]
*  She doesn't put border security and the lives of people affected by this border as a priority. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=107.4s)]
*  Well, and that might explain why, you know, in a recent poll, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=112.5s)]
*  she was people were asked, well, who do you trust more on immigration? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=115.5s)]
*  Forty percent said Kamala Harris, 53. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=118.5s)]
*  Trump, the other thing we talked about earlier this morning, Chris, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=121.5s)]
*  is the number one issue in Arizona. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=124.5s)]
*  And this is with really record high inflation is still the border. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=126.5s)]
*  I mean, it tells you just how badly it's affecting. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=131.5s)]
*  She's of course saying that she's the, you know, was addressing root causes. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=134.5s)]
*  She spent billions, literally billions on root causes, which I think is a scam. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=138.6s)]
*  We can talk about that later. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=143.6s)]
*  What has she done with her root causes? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=145.6s)]
*  I mean, what a joke. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=147.6s)]
*  The root causes are the White House and their failed policies, you know, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=149.6s)]
*  and the border issue is an immigration issue is not just Arizona. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=153.6s)]
*  I've been all around the country the last year, year and a half, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=157.6s)]
*  and it's impacting everybody's lives. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=160.6s)]
*  And, you know, I was just in New York. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=162.6s)]
*  I literally saw a gas station in Queens on my way to the airport yesterday, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=165.7s)]
*  and gas prices are cheaper there than they are here in Arizona. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=169.7s)]
*  So everything associated with this nonsense coming out of this administration [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=172.7s)]
*  is impacting lives. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=177.7s)]
*  But when you add the crime, the burden that it puts on the communities, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=178.7s)]
*  it's ridiculous. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=184.7s)]
*  And, you know, what's really crazy is they will applaud states [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=185.7s)]
*  that want to give sanctuary to illegal aliens, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=189.7s)]
*  but will go and prosecute states that try to do something about it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  So they do not prioritize what the American people are concerned about, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  and it is public safety and national security. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, they've got to get, it's just frustrating. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  It is frustrating for all of us. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, and you're right, every state is a border state. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  I just talked to suburban moms in New Jersey who are getting ready for school to start, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  who are complaining about class sizes, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  which they say is, of course, because of illegal immigration. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  It's impacting every single state and every single sector. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=220.9s)]
*  Chris, always great talking to you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=224.9s)]
*  Thanks for coming on this morning. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMj-r_ktJU&t=225.9s)]
