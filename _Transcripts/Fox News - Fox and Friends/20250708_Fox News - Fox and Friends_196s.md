# Elon Musk's big gamble: America Party challenges MAGA
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ)
*  And someone who else is good at that is Elon Musk, who has now even made more headlines [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=0.0s)]
*  talking about a third party and how that gamble could succeed, as Politico puts it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=5.24s)]
*  Now they talk about that Musk's plan can only work if he learns from the most successful [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=10.84s)]
*  political disruptors, including Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left, and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=15.08s)]
*  identifies places where both political parties are neglecting the real preferences of voters. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=19.84s)]
*  This means not finding a midpoint on a left-right spectrum, but rather seizing issues being [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=25.14s)]
*  beyond the standard D versus R menu. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=29.98s)]
*  Now arguably you could say, well, is Elon Musk doing that? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=34.14s)]
*  Is that what he's trying to do with this proposal for a third party? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=37.22s)]
*  But we know Andrew Yang's on board, right? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=40.58s)]
*  He's selling Fox News. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=42.22s)]
*  I'm excited for anyone who wants to move on from the duopoly, and I'm happy to help give [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=43.22s)]
*  someone a sense of what the path looks like. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=47.14s)]
*  You know, I kind of think this is kind of funny. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=50.54s)]
*  I take exception to Politico's characterization that somehow Bernie Sanders has been a success. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=53.46s)]
*  I don't know that he has been a success. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=59.42s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=61.1s)]
*  But the problem for Elon Musk right now is that we already have a third party. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=62.1s)]
*  It's called the Republican Party, and Donald Trump took it over and completely remade it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  So the idea that Elon Musk, with help from Elon Musk even, I'm really sort of doubtful [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=71.18s)]
*  that this is going to make a big difference. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=78.74000000000001s)]
*  Splash. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=81.06s)]
*  So that's such a salient point, Charlie, because if you go back to 1992, Ross Perot got 19% [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=82.38s)]
*  of the popular vote because people were disillusioned with the two parties because there wasn't [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=90.5s)]
*  enough emphasis, and I'm paraphrasing here, but there was a push for the economic issues [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=95.26s)]
*  that Americans were struggling with and neither party was paying attention to. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=101.94s)]
*  That was the driver. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=106.14s)]
*  There were other things, but that was a big one. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=107.18s)]
*  And President Trump got re-elected by identifying exactly the things that the American voters [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=109.66000000000001s)]
*  across political lines cared about, not just the economy, which he's now got his plan going [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=115.82000000000001s)]
*  forward, but also the border security. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=121.06s)]
*  And it doesn't, I'm fascinated to see where it goes, but it's hard to imagine the political [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=123.9s)]
*  desire, appetite for an alternative even exists after what President Trump has done to refocus [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=131.86s)]
*  and reimagine the Republican Party. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=139.5s)]
*  Well, that's the point. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=141.05999999999997s)]
*  There isn't one. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=142.05999999999997s)]
*  There is zero appetite for someone coming in and fracturing further what has been unified. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=143.05999999999997s)]
*  And when you talk about those issues, I mean, what, Bitcoin and pro-Second Amendment? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=148.06s)]
*  Welcome to the Republican Party. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=153.17999999999998s)]
*  I think it's better likenable under Trump. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=155.5s)]
*  It's better likenable, I think, to the Tea Party where you commit to the brand and then [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=157.94s)]
*  you do your work to try to influence others to vote on legislation and policy a certain [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=163.33999999999997s)]
*  way, but you do not introduce a separate identity so that we can all be civil. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=168.78s)]
*  If anyone gets that reference. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=172.98s)]
*  You guys remember that horrible book? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=175.17999999999998s)]
*  Schizophrenia. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=176.78s)]
*  Anyway, the whole point is it needs to stay under this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=177.78s)]
*  So hopefully they can find a way to become good stepbrothers again and not fracture us [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=180.14s)]
*  further. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=184.94s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=185.94s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3mp2m-rpQ&t=186.94s)]
