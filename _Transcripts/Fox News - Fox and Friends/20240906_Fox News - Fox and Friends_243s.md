# 'There's no way' Biden will allow Hunter to serve jail time
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4)
*  Fox News alert you saw it yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=0.0s)]
*  Hunter Biden made a last minute guilty plea to all nine federal tax charges, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=2.68s)]
*  blindsided in the Department of Justice and lead prosecutors who are ready to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=7.2s)]
*  proceed with the case. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=11.74s)]
*  The first son could now face up to 17 years in prison and a $1.3 million fine. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  So what is the defense's motive behind the shocking guilty plea here to explain [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=18.6s)]
*  as former acting U S attorney general, Matt Whitaker. Hey Matt, good morning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=23.2s)]
*  Good morning. Good morning. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=28.16s)]
*  Why do you think they did this? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=29.24s)]
*  Well, I think they were new that the time had run out. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=32.56s)]
*  They were about to pick a jury and ultimately this was going to be a whole [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=36.08s)]
*  case built on the Biden family business. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=41.04s)]
*  And I don't think that Joe Biden and Hunter Biden wanted that information to be, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=43.82s)]
*  you know, injected 60 days before an election. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=48.8s)]
*  I think that's a good conclusion. Obviously. So pardon. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=52.08s)]
*  Only Joe Biden would know, but it's just no scenario where he doesn't pardon his son. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=56.16s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=61.08s)]
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=61.92s)]
*  There's there's no way that we get to January 20th and Hunter Biden is facing [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=64.36s)]
*  jail time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=69.12s)]
*  What do you think? Why do you think Abby Lowell waited until the 11th hour? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=70.32s)]
*  I mean, this wasn't part of a plea deal. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=74.88s)]
*  There was no deal behind the scene because the prosecutors had all the goods on [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=77.0s)]
*  the guy and and they tried the Alford plea where they essentially said, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=83.0s)]
*  OK, he's guilty to this part, but not that part. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=86.84s)]
*  And they wouldn't go for that either. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=89.36s)]
*  Yeah, I really think discussions were happening, but obviously they weren't getting [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=93.2s)]
*  what they wanted. You know, as a former U.S. attorney, I've seen this up close in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=97.16s)]
*  hundreds of cases that I did an Alford plea. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=101.56s)]
*  You know, ultimately is an admission that the facts are bad and you will be [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=104.72s)]
*  convicted, but you maintain your innocence. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=110.0s)]
*  And obviously the government wasn't going to accept that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=112.52s)]
*  And so he had to take all the charges straight up. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  So also when it comes to Donald Trump, this judge has just ruled that the trial for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=118.08s)]
*  Trump on the charges stemming from J. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=122.8s)]
*  Six will not be held until after the presidential election. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  Did you expect this and why do you think the judge decided this? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=129.68s)]
*  Yeah, so Judge Chutkin in D.C. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  obviously was looking at the calendar, knowing that there's just not enough time to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=136.32s)]
*  have a trial. And obviously President Trump has reasons to not be available for a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=141.2s)]
*  trial. But at the same time, this case was so delayed by the Supreme Court's hearing [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=146.4s)]
*  of the immunity issue and decision in that in that issue that they're just the clock [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=151.68s)]
*  has ran out. And, you know, I think ultimately this case remains weak after the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=156.56s)]
*  Fisher case and after the immunity. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=161.28s)]
*  And no matter what Smith tries to do, I think this case is still remains a very weak [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=163.2s)]
*  case. Hey, Matt, we're going to find out today the judge is going to decide if he's [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=169.2s)]
*  going to postpone at the request of the Trump team the sentencing for his conviction [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=172.36s)]
*  in the New York case, which is supposed to be September 18th. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=177.6s)]
*  What do you think the judge does since he's already one time already postponed the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=181.2s)]
*  sentencing? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=185.68s)]
*  Yeah, so I was in court one day with this judge and I saw him up close as to how he [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  interacted with both the prosecution and the defense. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=193.6s)]
*  I think the issue here is not that he wants to sentence Trump, it's that he has to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=197.08s)]
*  review all of the evidence that was admitted at trial and decide if it's affected by [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=203.12s)]
*  the Supreme Court's immunity decision, which I think some of it quite possibly was, and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=208.56s)]
*  especially the Hope Hicks testimony. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=212.84s)]
*  So I think he's got, you know, multiple decisions both on this, whether to hold the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=214.96s)]
*  sentencing at all, but also what to do with his case since it's tainted by [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  evidence that was admitted that was immune. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  Let's see what they do today. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Whitaker, thank you very much for joining us live. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=229.72000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5dnamnjT4&t=231.64000000000001s)]
