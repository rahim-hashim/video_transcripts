# Outrage as Biden-Harris admin weighs restarting controversial migrant program
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0)
*  Despite possible mass fraud, Biden-Harris may soon restart a program letting thousands [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=0.0s)]
*  of illegal immigrants apply for U.S. entry from their home countries. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  The program, which lets Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan migrants apply for legal entry, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=12.34s)]
*  was paused just last month after an internal audit found potential fraud with over 100,000 [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=18.28s)]
*  applications having just over 3,000 sponsors. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=24.52s)]
*  Hmm, that's definitely curious. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=28.36s)]
*  Here to react, Fox News contributor and retired acting ICE director Tom Homan. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=30.6s)]
*  Tom, can we just start from the very beginning? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=36.16s)]
*  Why are we doing this? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=38.76s)]
*  We have a legal way to apply to enter into our country and we're restarting a program [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=40.8s)]
*  where we know people who have come through this program have come in here fraudulently, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=46.92s)]
*  have killed and raped Americans, and they're restarting it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=51.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  It's just another way of them bringing illegal aliens into the country. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=57.36s)]
*  They put them in a bucket with CHNV, this program, or they can put thousands into the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  CBP-1 app. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=65.0s)]
*  They're talking about the same illegal alien population. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=66.0s)]
*  They create these programs, what they call legal pathways, which they aren't. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=68.72s)]
*  They're illegal. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=72.44s)]
*  But they're creating these buckets, Rachel, so they can say illegal entries are down, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=73.44s)]
*  when they're not. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=76.67999999999999s)]
*  If you add what CBP, what Border Patrol is still catching, entering illegally, what's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  coming through the port of entries, what's coming through this program, we're still [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=81.32s)]
*  at historic highs. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=85.28s)]
*  And this recent program, the CHNV, I wrote an op-ed in February when they announced this [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=86.28s)]
*  program, before they even started it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=91.28s)]
*  And I said in that op-ed, Fox News op-ed, this program would result in massive fraud [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  and massive child trafficking. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=97.72s)]
*  And it has. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=99.16s)]
*  You mentioned possible fraud. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=100.44s)]
*  Let me give you one example of the fraud of this program. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=101.44s)]
*  And this comes from an inside source who was managing the program, a very good friend of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=105.0s)]
*  mine. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  One dead man sponsored 1,800 people. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  He's been dead for years. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=113.48s)]
*  And he's the sponsor of 1,800 people. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=114.48s)]
*  That's the type of fraud. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=117.08s)]
*  I'm telling you, there are thousands of children who are in sex trafficking because they were [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=118.08s)]
*  sponsored by sex traffickers and criminal cartels are already in the United States. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=122.08s)]
*  This is a terrible program that put a lot of children at risk. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=126.92s)]
*  I want to get to the children, but I just want to make very clear to our viewers, you're [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=129.88s)]
*  saying that this program was set up because if you're registered or you're processed in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=132.76s)]
*  which is what this program does, you get processed by an NGO in Peru and some other country and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=139.04s)]
*  then you're flown over here, then you're not actually counted in the numbers crossing the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=145.76s)]
*  border without paperwork. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=151.68s)]
*  So this is a way for our government to make it look like they've done something to lower [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=153.56s)]
*  the number of people coming over illegally when in fact they're increasing it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=158.16s)]
*  Let's get to the children because this is actually the most tragic thing I've ever seen. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=163.12s)]
*  I cannot believe that our government is complicit in losing three track of 300,000 children [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=166.96s)]
*  who you have said have fallen into slave labor, many of them and sex trafficking. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  I noticed in the interview with JD Vance the other day, reporters beat him up. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  Say, hey, during the trance mass deportation operation, you're going to separate families [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  like you did before. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=190.28s)]
*  Let me make something clear. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=191.28s)]
*  Wasn't family separation zero tolerance? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  About 2500 separations happen because the parents were prosecuted for entering the country [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  illegally which U.S. citizen parents get separated every day thousands of times across this country [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=199.96s)]
*  when a parent gets arrested, the child can't go to jail. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  So you're talking about 2500 of these cases. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=208.16000000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, they've got over 300,000 missing children. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  You tell me what's worse. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=213.96s)]
*  And the thing is, based on my three and a half decades of investigative experience in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=214.96s)]
*  human trafficking and alien smuggling, I guarantee you, Rachel, many of these children are living [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  with predators. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  Some of these children are in forced sex trade, in forced labor. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=226.28s)]
*  And no one's even looking for them. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=230.28s)]
*  In my sources of advice, no one's even looking for them. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=231.28s)]
*  So I make you this promise, when Trump's president again, we will go rescue these children. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  I asked Donald Trump in my interview with him that I had with Pete and Will, at bed [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=239.44s)]
*  minister asked him directly, would you locate these children? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  Will you promise to find the children that the Biden administration has lost? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=247.56s)]
*  And he told me straight up, that's easy. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=251.68s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  One last thing I want to note. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=255.12s)]
*  When you were in charge of Homeland Security and Border Patrol, there was a letter sent [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=256.6s)]
*  by Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, and Laura Bush, all three of them saying, we're so [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=266.36s)]
*  upset, we're writing this letter to defend the children, to fight for the children, that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump is separated at the border. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=279.52s)]
*  Where are they now? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=282.2s)]
*  Shame on them. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=283.2s)]
*  I appreciate you joining us, Tom. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=284.68s)]
*  It's really great to have you and thank you for bringing attention to this very important [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  topic. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=290.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=291.12s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-10ZDT14IY0&t=292.12s)]
