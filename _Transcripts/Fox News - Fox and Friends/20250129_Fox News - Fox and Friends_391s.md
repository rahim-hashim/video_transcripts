# Peter Doocy: This is a really big story
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os)
*  The Trump administration has a new mandate for millions of federal workers who have fallen [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=0.0s)]
*  in love with working from home and your PJs return to the office or resign. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=6.72s)]
*  Like the emphasis senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey has the details on the buyouts [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=12.96s)]
*  being offered to those employees. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=17.36s)]
*  Good morning, Peter. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=19.28s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=21.2s)]
*  The feds, the new Trump team thinks they could save 100 billion taxpayer dollars because [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=22.2s)]
*  they think that many people, that many federal government employees are going to reply to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=26.68s)]
*  an email they got last night with the word resign. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=30.360000000000003s)]
*  Part of that email says, if you resign under this program, you will retain all pay and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=34.04s)]
*  benefits regardless of your daily workload and will be exempted from all applicable in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  person work requirements until September 30th, 2025 or earlier if you choose to accelerate [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  your resignation for any reason. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=50.16s)]
*  Back in the napkin math, there are two million total federal workers. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Six percent of federal employees work full time in the office. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=57.28s)]
*  They think 200,000 would take this buyout. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=61.16s)]
*  That's how they get to 100 billion dollars in savings. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=64.56s)]
*  The Trump team did not single anybody out with this email last night. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=68.16s)]
*  Everybody got it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=72.28s)]
*  But they did single out General Mark Milley. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=73.36s)]
*  He had a security detail taken away last night and he could lose a star in retirement if [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  it is determined that he was undermining the chain of command during the first Trump [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=81.48s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=86.12s)]
*  A spokesman for the Pentagon now says, the secretary informed General Milley today that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=87.12s)]
*  he is revoking the authorization for his security detail and suspending his security clearance [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=91.68s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=96.08s)]
*  The secretary has also directed the DOD IG to conduct an inquiry into the facts and circumstances [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=97.08s)]
*  surrounding General Milley's conduct so that the secretary may determine whether it is [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=102.44s)]
*  appropriate to reopen his military grade review determination. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  Milley's access now limited access to the White House briefing room on the other hand, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=111.36s)]
*  now wide open. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=116.36s)]
*  We welcome independent journalists, podcasters, social media influencers and content creators [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=118.48s)]
*  to apply for credentials to cover this White House. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=124.5s)]
*  Starting today, this seat in the front of the room, which is usually occupied by the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=128.76s)]
*  press secretary's staff, will be called the new media seat. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=133.44s)]
*  Caroline clearly did her homework. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=138.68s)]
*  She was very well prepared to talk not only about the issues of the day, but also about [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=140.6s)]
*  everything that her boss had already answered, which is probably kind of hard when he is [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=145.22s)]
*  answering questions off the cuff roughly 10 times a day. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=151.16s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=154.76s)]
*  Peter, isn't the advantage it seems that she's with the president all the time? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=155.76s)]
*  So she doesn't have to look in a book. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=159.64s)]
*  She knows what he thinks. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=161.68s)]
*  She knows what he said. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=162.76s)]
*  But also just when the president is making it known so often what he thinks about stuff. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=166.56s)]
*  There was nothing yesterday where she said, I haven't heard the president talk about this [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=173.44s)]
*  yet. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=176.52s)]
*  I'd have to ask him. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=177.52s)]
*  I think reporters are running out of questions because they are covering everything. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=178.52s)]
*  It's like you could go to him with the New York Post and say, okay, let's start on the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=183.06s)]
*  first page. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=186.56s)]
*  What do you think about this? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=187.56s)]
*  General Milley, okay, what do you think? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=188.56s)]
*  Did you see this thing about the Obamas? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=190.16s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  I think he's going to be soon just because he is talking so much. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=194.28s)]
*  She was also the deputy under Kayleigh McEnany when he served his first term. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=198.72s)]
*  So she's very involved and experienced and knows his agenda. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  And Peter, does Fox have the same chair second over from the right on the front row? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=207.76s)]
*  Yes, everything with the seating chart is the same. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  Just there are a lot more people standing on the sides. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=217.27999999999997s)]
*  It looked like dozens of people standing on the sides, whereas at the tail end of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=220.9s)]
*  the Biden administration, not only was there nobody standing on the sides, but there were [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=223.86s)]
*  empty seats. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=227.34s)]
*  And then the only people who lost seats are actually White House staff. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=228.34s)]
*  There would usually be two aides that the press secretary could just kind of look down [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=233.1s)]
*  at and say, hey, we're going to get them something about this, right? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=236.82s)]
*  Those two seats are now going to be taken by new media outlets. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=240.34s)]
*  Yesterday it was Axios and Breitbart. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=243.62s)]
*  Peter, what's the temperature in the room? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=245.14000000000001s)]
*  Is it more adversarial like it was the first term or is it more probative? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=247.18s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=253.62s)]
*  Yesterday it seemed like for the reporters in the room, and I was not there, Jackie Heinrich [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=255.06s)]
*  was there, but it seemed like for the reporters in the room and for Caroline, everybody was [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=259.90000000000003s)]
*  just kind of feeling each other out. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=263.62s)]
*  They wanted to see how far they could push her with questions and how she would answer. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=265.18s)]
*  And it's going to take time for reporters in the room and also for Caroline to develop [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=270.62s)]
*  a rhythm. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=275.66s)]
*  But yesterday I think it was just kind of everybody was feeling each other out. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=277.22s)]
*  And Peter, you said they're going to have some White House staffers kind of right there [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=281.04s)]
*  where she can turn and say, hey, what do we know about that? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=284.04s)]
*  That kind of goes back to the first day of the Trump administration. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=287.06s)]
*  You were in the Oval Office with the president and you asked him a bunch of questions and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=291.76s)]
*  one of them was about drones. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=296.04s)]
*  And he turned to Suzy Wilds and he said, can we get something for them on drones? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=299.1s)]
*  And yesterday, that's actually how Caroline started the press conference. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=303.84s)]
*  Some good constituent services there because it was only a week after I asked the president [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  what the deal was with those drones over in New Jersey that we heard so much about and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=316.35999999999996s)]
*  now we hear nothing about. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=320.08s)]
*  And she went out there with a message from the president who did get to the bottom of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=321.26s)]
*  it or at least got to the bottom of what they can say publicly. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=326.67999999999995s)]
*  And he said these were FAA authorized drone flights that then were joined by a bunch of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  hobbyists who were putting up their own drones to see what was going on, but they were not [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=336.56s)]
*  adversarial. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=340.32000000000005s)]
*  That is a huge news story that obviously there's so much going on. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=341.6s)]
*  There are so many huge news stories, but that is a really, really big one. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  And I don't know why the Biden administration just said that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  We're scratching our heads. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  Why wouldn't he just say that and say that? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=354.72s)]
*  Especially because there were military bases in New Jersey with the ability to scramble [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=357.0s)]
*  fighter jets and helicopters that were going up there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=363.72s)]
*  Nobody from the Biden White House could call and say, hey, these are FAA authorized and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=367.68s)]
*  joined by some hobbyists. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=374.04s)]
*  It's not the enemy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=375.04s)]
*  Could have been easier. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=376.04s)]
*  Put the jets down. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=377.04s)]
*  Save the gas. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=378.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=379.04s)]
*  Great job, Peter. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=380.04s)]
*  Now we know. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWu6ukXF0os&t=381.04s)]
