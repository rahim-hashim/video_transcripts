# 'Classic Trump': China, Canada, Mexico face tariff threats
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg)
*  All right, President-elect Trump is threatening tariffs [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=0.0s)]
*  on all imports from Mexico, Canada, and China [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=2.92s)]
*  when he gets into office. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=5.36s)]
*  And this could impact the price of everything [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=6.72s)]
*  from technology, cars, food, and other everyday goods. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  So what do consumers need to know? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=12.0s)]
*  Trump economic advisor Stephen Moore joins us now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=14.82s)]
*  So Stephen, The Wall Street Journal is warning about this [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=18.12s)]
*  this way, saying Trump's tariffs will refill the swamp [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=21.56s)]
*  when Washington wants to impose new taxes, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=25.92s)]
*  including tariffs, the companies and people [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=28.0s)]
*  who would be affected rushed to trade associations, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=30.08s)]
*  public relations firms, and lobbyists for help. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=32.56s)]
*  So is that the correct analysis, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=36.32s)]
*  or do you have something else to say [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=40.4s)]
*  about these tariff threats? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Hi, Katie, happy holidays. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=44.64s)]
*  Well, listen, I think that it's unlikely [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=46.2s)]
*  that we're gonna see 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  We do have a free trade agreement, after all, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  that was negotiated by Donald Trump. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=56.1s)]
*  I think what's going on here, Katie, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=58.1s)]
*  is Trump is using this tariff threat [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=60.18s)]
*  to get Canada, Mexico, and China to cooperate [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=62.900000000000006s)]
*  in terms of stopping the importation [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=66.86s)]
*  of these deadly drugs into this country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=70.54s)]
*  And he's made it very clear, these three countries should be [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=74.1s)]
*  and could be doing more to keep fentanyl and other drugs [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=77.22s)]
*  out of the United States. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=81.22s)]
*  And so I think this is classic Trump. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=82.34s)]
*  He uses the threat of tariffs to get an advantage [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=85.58s)]
*  and to also pursue America's interests. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=88.94s)]
*  So that's, I think, the likely outcome of this, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=91.06s)]
*  is that I think you're gonna get more cooperation [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=95.02s)]
*  on the border from Mexico and Canada. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=97.08s)]
*  I can't say though about China, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=99.94s)]
*  because China is an enemy of the United States, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=101.38s)]
*  unlike Canada and Mexico. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=104.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=106.06s)]
*  So Steve, what about the trade deficit issue here? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=106.9s)]
*  Because of course there's the fentanyl [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=110.06s)]
*  and the border security, but you know, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=111.5s)]
*  Justin Trudeau flew to Mar-a-Lago, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=113.9s)]
*  and then President-elect Trump joked about making Canada [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=116.34s)]
*  the 51st state if he couldn't get that trade deficit fixed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=119.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=121.5s)]
*  Yeah, he wants Wayne Gretzky [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=122.78s)]
*  to be the next prime minister of Canada. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=123.94000000000001s)]
*  I thought that was great, great line by the president. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=126.18s)]
*  Listen, it is true that some of these countries [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=129.26s)]
*  are cheating against the United States, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=133.44s)]
*  that we don't have fair trade with some of these countries. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=135.3s)]
*  And I think Trump is basically saying, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=137.74s)]
*  bring down your tariffs, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=139.5s)]
*  stop discriminating against American products. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=141.66s)]
*  So it's just something I think [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=145.33999999999997s)]
*  the American workers wanna see. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=146.26s)]
*  Look, I'm a free trade guy, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=148.89999999999998s)]
*  but all countries have to be lowering their tariffs. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=150.42s)]
*  We have some of the lowest tariffs in the world. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=153.78s)]
*  So when it comes to the countries [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  talking about these negotiations, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=158.78s)]
*  small businesses here at home are feeling optimistic [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=160.42s)]
*  about the economy after Trump's win. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=163.33999999999997s)]
*  The optimism index has risen in anticipation [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  of Trump 2.0. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=169.78s)]
*  So how does, do the tariffs play into this? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=170.94s)]
*  Are they not concerned about them actually going through? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=173.7s)]
*  What does this mean? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=176.46s)]
*  I think these countries have experiences with Trump. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=178.78s)]
*  They know he means business. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=183.62s)]
*  And we finally have a president who's, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=185.46s)]
*  look, America has its mojo back right now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=187.66s)]
*  We're gonna be, we are the alpha male economy in the world. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=189.66s)]
*  And this new business survey that you mentioned, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=193.14s)]
*  where small businesses and medium sized businesses [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  are feeling really super optimistic [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=198.74s)]
*  about what the economy will do in 2025, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=201.34s)]
*  is an indication that finally we have somebody [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=203.94s)]
*  that's gonna be in the White House [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=206.54000000000002s)]
*  who doesn't treat businesses like they're, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=207.86s)]
*  American businesses like they're enemy combatants. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  He's pro-business, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=212.70000000000002s)]
*  cause he's a businessman himself, Katie. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=213.78s)]
*  Yeah, I love the alpha male economy of the world. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=215.86s)]
*  That's a great line and great way to put it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=218.70000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Stephen. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=221.38s)]
*  Katie, you have a great New Year. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiSqIZA-Wg&t=223.38s)]
