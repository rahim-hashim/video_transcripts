# Trump in ‘way stronger position’ than past elections, pollster says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8)
*  Let's talk about the number one story in America and around the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=0.0s)]
*  That is this election. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=3.0s)]
*  We have 11 days and counting. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=4.0s)]
*  What's the real clear averages on the seven battleground states? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=5.0s)]
*  Let's look over in Arizona. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=8.0s)]
*  Trump up 1.5. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=9.0s)]
*  Biden was up by two. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=11.0s)]
*  Hillary 1.5 at this point with 11 days left. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=12.0s)]
*  Trump is winning in Nevada. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=15.0s)]
*  That would be a shocker. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=16.0s)]
*  He's up 0.7. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=17.0s)]
*  Biden was up by five. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=18.0s)]
*  Hillary by three. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=20.0s)]
*  They would hold on to those states. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=21.0s)]
*  Trump would actually win Arizona. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=23.0s)]
*  Trump lost Wisconsin. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=24.0s)]
*  One Wisconsin, one Wisconsin lost, excuse me, one in 2016, then lost it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=26.0s)]
*  Right now he is up by 0.2, obviously within the margin of error. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=31.0s)]
*  In Michigan, Trump broke the blue wall in 2016. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=35.0s)]
*  He then was put back together by Joe Biden just barely. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=39.0s)]
*  Right now Trump leads by 0.2 percent. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=43.0s)]
*  In Pennsylvania, where everyone's focused on, you have Trump up by 0.6. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=46.0s)]
*  In Pennsylvania at this point, Biden was up by 4.8. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=50.0s)]
*  Hillary 5.2. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=53.0s)]
*  As you know, Hillary would go on to lose that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=54.0s)]
*  In North Carolina, the last time a Democrat won that was Barack Obama. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=56.0s)]
*  At this point, with North Carolina, Biden was up 1.2. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=60.0s)]
*  Hillary up by 2.2. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=63.0s)]
*  And then in Georgia, Trump lost it famously in 2020. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=65.0s)]
*  He's now leading by 2.2 percent. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=69.0s)]
*  Good thing he mended fences with the governor there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=71.0s)]
*  Biden has been up, was up by 0.7 at this point. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=73.0s)]
*  He'd go on to win it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=76.0s)]
*  Trump was up by 3.3. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=77.0s)]
*  He would go on to win it against Hillary Clinton. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=80.0s)]
*  Here to discuss this, where we stand in the race and what could still change. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=82.0s)]
*  The founder and president of Real Clear Politics, Tom Bevin. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=86.0s)]
*  Tom, what's your takeaway from Trump leading but in the margin of error? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=89.0s)]
*  Yeah, five of the seven battlegrounds, as you just laid out, Brian, are under one percentage point. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=94.0s)]
*  And this could be, again, I get asked this all the time. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=99.0s)]
*  We talk about, are these polls accurate? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=102.0s)]
*  Are they undercounting Trump's support like they did in 2020 and 2016? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=104.0s)]
*  And obviously, if they are, he's got even bigger leads in these states. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=108.0s)]
*  But it seems to be very close at the national level. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=113.0s)]
*  Harris is leading on our average, but by three tenths of one percentage point. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=116.0s)]
*  So Trump's in a way stronger position now than he was four years ago and eight years ago. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=119.0s)]
*  So you got to wonder why Kamala Harris would go to Texas since it's not a battleground stage. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=124.0s)]
*  He's not going to win it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=130.0s)]
*  She's going to go there to help count Alred against Senator Ted Cruz, where Alred's trailing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=131.0s)]
*  Why would you worry so much about the Senate, especially if you should be worried about getting the presidency? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=137.0s)]
*  Well, right. I mean, that's it's an interesting strategic decision for her as president. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=142.0s)]
*  But for the Senate, it makes sense. I mean, Democrats, the map is pretty rough for them this year with Joe Manchin leaving. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=148.0s)]
*  John Tester's in big trouble in Montana. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=154.0s)]
*  Sherrod Brown is in some trouble in Ohio. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=156.0s)]
*  And Ted Cruz represents really the only opportunity for Democrats to pick somebody off. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=158.0s)]
*  A recent poll there had that race at one point. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=163.0s)]
*  He's up about four point two points in our average. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=166.0s)]
*  I went back and looked in twenty eighteen at Donald Trump wasn't on the ballot. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=169.0s)]
*  OK, but Cruz only won by three points. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=174.0s)]
*  But his final polls were six point eight. He underperformed his polls by four point two percent. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=177.0s)]
*  Exactly where he is right now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=182.0s)]
*  Dan Patrick, the lieutenant governor, said Kamala Harris coming to Texas for a rally is one of the dumbest political decisions I've ever seen. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=184.0s)]
*  She and Colin Alred are not going to win Texas. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=191.0s)]
*  I'm glad she's spending the day in Texas instead of campaigning in a swing state. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=193.0s)]
*  Only a few days left in the election. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=197.0s)]
*  I hope she stays longer. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=199.0s)]
*  So the question is, where do you go if you want to close strong? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=201.0s)]
*  If you are, for example, Trump, where would you be heading looking at these seven battlegrounds? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=205.0s)]
*  He was in Nevada yesterday. He's going to be in Pennsylvania on Saturday. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=210.0s)]
*  He's going to be in New York on Sunday. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=214.0s)]
*  Where would you tell the Trump camp to go? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=216.0s)]
*  Oh, I go to Pennsylvania. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=220.0s)]
*  I mean, listen, he's ahead. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=222.0s)]
*  Georgia's he's over two points in Georgia. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=223.0s)]
*  He's a point and a half in Arizona. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=225.0s)]
*  So the Sun Belt is looking pretty good for Donald Trump, which leaves Kamala Harris. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=226.0s)]
*  Her path right now is basically Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=230.0s)]
*  She wins those three. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=233.0s)]
*  She can lose everything else and win it to 70 to 68. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=234.0s)]
*  Trump wins any of those states. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=237.0s)]
*  He's going to be president. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=239.0s)]
*  Harris, if you're if you're the vice president, what state would you say I could I got it? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=240.0s)]
*  I got to lock this up or I got to come back and take this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=245.0s)]
*  Where would you go? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=248.0s)]
*  Well, obviously, as I just said, she's got to win those upper three. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=250.0s)]
*  I think her best opportunity outside of that is North Carolina. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=253.0s)]
*  Sixteen electoral votes. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=256.0s)]
*  It would give her a little wiggle room in the blue wall if she she could lose Michigan or Wisconsin. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=257.0s)]
*  And she picks up North Carolina and still win the presidency. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=262.0s)]
*  Tuesday, she's going to give her closing argument. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=265.0s)]
*  It's going to be at the ellipse. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=267.0s)]
*  Some have said it's going to be all about January 6th and it's going to be about the our democracies at stake. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=268.0s)]
*  Is that the closing message that will resonate with the American people? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=275.0s)]
*  Not if you believe the polls. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=279.0s)]
*  I mean, the economy inflation is the number one issue by three or four times the next biggest issue. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=281.0s)]
*  Threat to democracy is somewhere well down the list. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=285.0s)]
*  And so that's not what voters care about. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=288.0s)]
*  So I think it probably it hasn't moved the needle thus far. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=290.0s)]
*  I don't expect it will as a closing argument. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=292.0s)]
*  Yeah, Tommy, got to wonder if you're Joe Biden, if you have one of those clear thoughts, you might be saying I could be doing better than that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=296.0s)]
*  We'll see what happens when it's all said and done. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=303.0s)]
*  Tom Bevin, thank you very much. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=305.0s)]
*  Appreciate it. Real clear. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=307.0s)]
*  Everyone goes to that when they wake up in the morning. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=308.0s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_tiNxfL1l8&t=310.0s)]
