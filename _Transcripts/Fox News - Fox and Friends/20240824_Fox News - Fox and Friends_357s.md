# Trump vows full transparency on JFK assassination if elected
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY)
*  I will establish a new independent presidential commission on assassination attempts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=0.0s)]
*  And they will be tasked with releasing all of the remaining documents pertaining to the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=17.72s)]
*  assassination of President John F. Kennedy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=23.84s)]
*  And they will also conduct a rigorous review of the attack last month. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=28.24s)]
*  Donald Trump vowing full transparency on the JFK assassination if re-elected and to take [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=35.199999999999996s)]
*  the lead in investigating the attempt on his own life. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  Meanwhile, at least five Secret Service agents were pulled from the field and placed on administrative [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  duties, one of them from Trump's personal protective team following that fateful day [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=49.959999999999994s)]
*  in Pennsylvania. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=55.28s)]
*  Florida Congressman Michael Waltz is on the committee investigating the Trump assassination [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=56.76s)]
*  attempt and he joins us now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=60.28s)]
*  Congressman, great to have you on the show. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=62.08s)]
*  We had a Secret Service, we had a former Secret Service agent on the show a little bit earlier. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=64.32s)]
*  He was very animated. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=69.28s)]
*  This is all too little too late. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=70.56s)]
*  Do you think this investigation or this proposal by Trump would help us towards finding not [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  just accountability but the truth on his attempted assassination and others? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=78.68s)]
*  Well, we'll take a step back for a moment and I applaud the president for doing this [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=85.0s)]
*  because he and himself personally, his first administration and then how he's conducting [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=89.16s)]
*  himself in this campaign is all about transparency. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  And after years of Russiagate, after the nation watching the Department of Justice be weaponized [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  against political opponents, President Trump is trying to bring whatever transparency he [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=106.72s)]
*  can onto the federal government and restore people's trust in the intelligence community, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=112.88s)]
*  in the Justice Department and across their government. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  And so much trust has been lost down to the point where I sat there and he promised the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=122.8s)]
*  13 Gold Star families from Abbey Gate when he gets back into office, all the tapes, all [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=128.64s)]
*  the videos, all the emails, everything will be released so that they can have full visibility [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=134.48s)]
*  on what happened. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=140.8s)]
*  So going back 60 years to the JFK assassination, why are there still nearly 5,000 heavily redacted [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=141.92s)]
*  or partially redacted documents? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=150.56s)]
*  President Trump released a number of them while he was in office. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=153.2s)]
*  But come on, 60 years later, you're going to argue that there's still some type of classified [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=156.6s)]
*  material from 60 years ago that needs to be protected. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=162.6s)]
*  So I think it's all about transparency. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=165.6s)]
*  I applaud it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I want more transparency too. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  I also want everything from 9-11 declassified. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  I want the X-T stuff declassified. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  I want it all declassified. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=175.2s)]
*  I think people have lost trust in our institutions. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=176.2s)]
*  One of the things that also troubles me is whenever we have situations like this, by [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=179.76s)]
*  the way, this is a huge issue. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=183.0s)]
*  The president was almost shot in the head, a Republican voter was killed and two were [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  very seriously injured, almost died as well. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  So we know there's this kid and he has encrypted accounts. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=193.72s)]
*  Why don't we know more about him? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=198.44s)]
*  And would you explain exactly what he means by encrypted accounts? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=199.84s)]
*  Well, the task force received an FBI briefing this week. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=204.16s)]
*  They are having some progress in getting into these encrypted accounts. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=210.2s)]
*  So for example, if you have, say, Signal or WhatsApp, these popular apps, they're based [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=215.24s)]
*  in the United States and law enforcement can go through a fairly efficient process through [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=222.84s)]
*  the courts to get subpoenas and to get access with probable cause. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  But if they're deliberately based overseas, everyone knows whether they're foreign intelligence [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=233.6s)]
*  agencies or terrorist groups, that it is much more difficult for us to access. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=238.92s)]
*  So why did this 19 year old health care aide have accounts based in three different countries [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=243.48s)]
*  in Germany and Belgium and in New Zealand? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=248.48s)]
*  That makes no sense to me. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=251.16s)]
*  It makes no sense to me how he learned how to construct multiple IEDs with a remote detonator [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=252.68s)]
*  that was on his body without any flags and without anyone noticing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=258.76s)]
*  So the other thing that bothers me, Rachel, is that in multiple briefings, the FBI has [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=265.32s)]
*  been very quick to say, we think he acted alone, yet he had all of this other activity. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=270.48s)]
*  And then in the same breath, they say, we still don't know motive. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=276.08s)]
*  And you overlay that with ongoing Iranian plots, an indictment for which was just unveiled [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=279.32s)]
*  just in the last few weeks where a Pakistani-born operative with ties to Iran was putting down [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=286.08s)]
*  payments on Hitman in addition to recruiting spotters and recruiting protesters, a sophisticated [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=292.88s)]
*  plot. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=300.2s)]
*  So we have so much to uncover here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=302.12s)]
*  And my frustration is the FBI and the Secret Service are moving at a snail's pace. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=305.54s)]
*  They're acting like this is a one-time incident that we can take our time to really unpack. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  No, these plots are happening right now as we speak. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=316.58000000000004s)]
*  We have a foreign enemy trying to kill our former president. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=319.74s)]
*  We need to be releasing information as we get it, and they need to move a lot faster [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=324.02000000000004s)]
*  in my view. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=328.46000000000004s)]
*  Man, that's the kind of information we need to be hearing and understanding and processing. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=329.46000000000004s)]
*  Otherwise, as I mentioned, 60 years from now, we're going to be studying this because [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=333.54s)]
*  they covered it up in real time, just like we are doing now with what happened to JFK. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=336.5s)]
*  Congressman Michael Walsh, thanks for doing everything you can to try to get us info. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=341.70000000000005s)]
*  We need it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZWUoFMYxY&t=345.66s)]
