# Tom Homan BLASTS Dems visiting El Salvador: 'DISGUSTING'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0)
*  So Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen is heading to El Salvador today where illegal immigrant and suspected MS-13 gang member [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=0.0s)]
*  Kilmar Arbrego Garcia is being held while the Trump administration fights his return to the U.S. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=8.44s)]
*  I don't even know if we announced this, but I am planning tomorrow to go to El Salvador [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=15.48s)]
*  To work to bring him home. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=19.68s)]
*  The Trump administration themselves admitted in federal court that he was wrongfully abducted from the United States. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=27.08s)]
*  Truly incredible. This comes as House Democrats were reportedly planning to send a delegation to the mega prison where he's being held. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=36.92s)]
*  Let's bring in the man himself. Where's our Tom Homan joins us now. Tom, I just want to focus on one portion when the senator said that he was abducted. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=45.36s)]
*  As the former leader of ICE, what do you say to him? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=55.88s)]
*  He wasn't abducted. He's an MS-13 gang member classified as a terrorist that was removed from this country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  So we got rid of a dangerous person, an El Salvador national was returned to the country of El Salvador. So he's home. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  We removed him from the United States. The public safety threatened exactly what should have happened. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm disgusted that any congressional representative is going to run to El Salvador for his aid. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=80.84s)]
*  Yesterday I read in his state that illegal aliens charged with murder was released back into the community and ICE had to go find him. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  In his state. The murder of Rachel Moran yesterday. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=97.4s)]
*  Listen to the testimony and listen to the mother on the handy last night. If you're not human, then your heart wasn't broken. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=104.36s)]
*  It's just in his state. But rather than taking care of the constituents in his state, the victims of illegal crime in his state, he's going to run to El Salvador to protect the MS-13 terrorist. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=111.6s)]
*  It's just disgusting. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=122.56s)]
*  You just talked about that sound from Patty Moran, Rachel's mom. We actually have it. Let's play it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=123.56s)]
*  I'm very angry. I'm actually outraged, but I'm too sad at the moment to show anger at the same time. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=129.12s)]
*  There was no action on the Democratic Party in any way from Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, my orcas. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=135.12s)]
*  Anyone here in Maryland, none of the senators did anything to help search for the murderer of my daughter. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=146.12s)]
*  Tom, where were the phone calls? Where were the congressional delegations at her funeral supporting her family when she was killed? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=154.12s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=162.12s)]
*  Not illegal. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=163.12s)]
*  They don't care. And further on in the testimony, in her interview, she talks about how her young daughter died, how she suffered, how she fought for her life. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=164.12s)]
*  Just like Rick and Riley. For how long? 17 minutes she fought for her life. That young girl didn't want to die. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=173.12s)]
*  So these congressmen, the senators, how do these women die? How they fought for their lives? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=179.12s)]
*  Do they have daughters? Do they have any care at all for American citizens that are victims of these crimes? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=184.12s)]
*  But they're loud and screaming now about this MS-13 game. Where were they when we had 12 million illegal aliens coming across the border? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=190.12s)]
*  Where were they when we had 600% increase in sex trafficking? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=199.12s)]
*  Where were they when we had 4,000 aliens dying making this journey under Joe Biden? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=202.12s)]
*  Where were they when we had a quarter million Americans dying from fentanyl? It's just ridiculous. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=206.12s)]
*  Every day I can't believe what I'm hearing. Yesterday I hear about a case from Washington state. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=210.12s)]
*  Two illegal aliens from Venezuela kidnapped and tortured and tried to kill a woman, robbed her, using a power drill, torturing her and drilling through her hand. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=215.12s)]
*  Every day I sit at the White House and hear these cases of sanctuary cities not helping ICE remove public safety threats from their communities. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=223.12s)]
*  Well, Tom, the proof is in the pudding. And we're looking at the border now and there's just no, there's a stark contrast between the border now versus under Joe Biden. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=231.12s)]
*  Here's some of the some of the footage right there where you can see during the Biden years. And now look at it now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=242.12s)]
*  I mean, it's almost operational control. And it's just not the imagery. When you look at the numbers 95% down when it comes to those crossing numbers. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=248.12s)]
*  How are you able to get it done? And so quickly with no legislation passed? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=257.12s)]
*  Because I work for the greatest president in my lifetime, Donald Trump. He secured that border in five weeks. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=262.12s)]
*  He did in five weeks with Joe Biden couldn't or wouldn't do in four years. Today, as we're talking right now, as we're talking right now, Lawrence, we have the most secure border in my lifetime right now because of President Trump's actions. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=269.12s)]
*  And again, get back sanctuary cities. They want to keep their keep their game going. So here's what we're going to do. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=283.12s)]
*  I'm going to get together with Secretary Noem. We're going to flood these sanctuary cities with federal agents. If we can't arrest the bad guy in the jail, we're going to arrest him on the street. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=288.12s)]
*  We got to do it stronger. We got to do it faster. If we can't do it in the streets, then we're going to we're going to increase worksite enforcement operations. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=295.12s)]
*  Those sanctuary cities were going to flood worksite enforcement operations. We can't arrest him at the home. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=302.12s)]
*  Then we're rest of that workplace. We're coming to sanctuary cities. We're going to put all our hands on deck. Sanctuary cities are not going to get away with the state leg illegality that's killing Americans at record numbers. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=307.12s)]
*  I'm disgusted every representative on the Hill who isn't fighting with ice to arrest every public safety threat, every national security threat roaming around these communities. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=317.12s)]
*  President Trump made a promise. We're going to keep that promise. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=326.12s)]
*  But the proof is in the pudding. As I said, he's definitely keeping his promise. And so are you, Tom. Thanks for joining the show this morning. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIHRG7rdpv0&t=329.12s)]
