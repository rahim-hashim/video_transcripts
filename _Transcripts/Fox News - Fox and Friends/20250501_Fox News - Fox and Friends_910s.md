# Steve Doocy makes announcement on 'Fox & Friends'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc)
*  Do you remember that 80s Dunkin' Donuts commercial where the alarm clock goes off at 3.30? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=0.0s)]
*  Time to make the donuts. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=8.4s)]
*  Well for the last 30 years when my alarm clock goes off at 3.30, if it wakes up my wife Kathy, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=14.8s)]
*  she always says, it's time to make the donuts. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=20.52s)]
*  And I say, you're right, it's time to make the donuts. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  And I get up and I go to work. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=25.66s)]
*  You know how many mornings my alarm has gone off at 3.30? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=27.56s)]
*  Well according to AI, 6,828 times. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=31.0s)]
*  And that ladies and gentlemen is a lot of donuts. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=35.68s)]
*  It is a great job, but the hours suck. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=38.56s)]
*  Ainsley and I have talked about this for years, about how hard it is to dash back from wherever [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=42.92s)]
*  we are on the weekends to be live on this couch at 6 a.m. on Monday. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=47.7s)]
*  But we have to because the curvy couch is an important part of the show. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=52.54s)]
*  Which brings me to this public service announcement. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=55.72s)]
*  After decades of getting up at 3.30 and driving into New York City in the dark, today is the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=58.8s)]
*  last day I will host this show from the couch. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=65.0s)]
*  I'm not retiring, I'm not leaving the show. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=69.0s)]
*  I'm still a host, but it's time for a change. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=71.92s)]
*  Suzanne Scott, the CEO of Fox News Media and a friend of mine for over 30 years and I have [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=74.8s)]
*  been trying to figure out what a guy who has been getting up at 3.30 for two generations [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=80.0s)]
*  should do next. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=85.96s)]
*  And Suzanne gave me a great option to keep working on this show, just not every day. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=87.52s)]
*  So from now on, I am working three days a week. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=93.0s)]
*  Essentially it's the Johnny Carson show deal. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=96.32s)]
*  Remember Johnny worked his three days in Burbank and I will be based in Florida, which means [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=99.16s)]
*  you may never see me in a necktie again. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=105.42s)]
*  Well Florida is strategic because it's going to make it easier for me to report from Florida [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=108.84s)]
*  and other parts of America that don't get a lot of network air time. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=112.9s)]
*  I'll be going from the Carolinas to the Keys, from Middle America to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=116.04s)]
*  So call me the Coast to Coast Host. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=120.2s)]
*  So when my kids were growing up, I never had breakfast with them. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  I was always here. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=128.2s)]
*  Cathy did everything. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  But starting tomorrow, I'm going to have breakfast with my grandkids and my children whenever [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  I can. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=135.28s)]
*  So transitioning from it's time to make the donuts to it's time to make the breakfast, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=136.28s)]
*  Grandpa. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=141.48s)]
*  Now step on it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=142.48s)]
*  By the way, lots of great breakfast ideas in our number one bestselling Happy Breakfast [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=143.72s)]
*  series. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=148.0s)]
*  Still available everywhere. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=149.0s)]
*  Tomorrow Cathy and I are going to go to D.C. to meet our two week old grandson George, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=150.96s)]
*  my son Peter and his wife Hillary and their two year old Bridget will get the first batch [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=156.6s)]
*  of Coast to Coast Host French Toast. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=160.86s)]
*  And then we're off to Dallas where Sally and her husband Ali just moved into a brand [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=164.44s)]
*  new house with their two year old son Arthur. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=168.56s)]
*  They needed more space because Sally's having a boy in July. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=171.16s)]
*  And L.J. tells me Dallas is really beautiful in the month of July. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=174.9s)]
*  And my daughter slash lawyer Mary and her husband Marshall always need help with their [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  dog Peanut. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=183.92s)]
*  So Gaga and Grandpa are hitting the road to spoil all of our kids and our grandkids. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=185.1s)]
*  Not with stuff per se, but just by being there. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=190.6s)]
*  So they're already stocking up the fridge with formula and chardonnay, which they call [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=193.68s)]
*  Grandpa's medicine. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  I will continue to join the couch crew for commentary. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=200.56s)]
*  You've trusted me for all these years and don't worry, you will still hear my voice [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=204.72s)]
*  and my opinions loud and clear despite whatever seasonal pollen is killing me. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=209.44s)]
*  And today I looked up it's tree pollen. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=214.44s)]
*  There is one downside. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=217.8s)]
*  I have a lot of friends in this skyscraper. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to miss seeing them in person. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=222.52s)]
*  The security guys, the cafe crew, especially the hair and makeup team, because they are [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=228.4s)]
*  geniuses at what they do. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  Exhibit A, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=234.36s)]
*  And the closest to my heart, the Fox and Friends team working day and night producing America's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  number one cable morning news show. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  And our leader, all star producer Megan Albano, who's standing right there, gets a special [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  shout out because she is going to help me make my new schedule work. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=247.88s)]
*  And for that, I am eternally grateful. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=251.76s)]
*  The studio and control room crews have lots of folks I've worked alongside for decades. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  That's why it makes it hard. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=259.0s)]
*  Just know you will still hear from me every day when I play wordle with you as soon as [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=260.48s)]
*  Chris Chulo picks the word and then Ted says he solved it in two. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=265.44s)]
*  Ted is a liar. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm just calling you out. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  Wherever he is. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  And as for the cast on the couch, who I love and adore, if this was the last day I'd ever [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  work with you again, the waterworks would be flowing. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=279.84s)]
*  You know me. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=281.84s)]
*  But after a little vacation, I'm going to be back on the show via the magic of television [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=282.96s)]
*  where somewhere, I guarantee you, somebody will ask me, is Ainsley really that sweet? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=287.24s)]
*  And I'll say she is. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=293.64s)]
*  And is Lawrence really that much fun? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=294.64s)]
*  And I'll say he is indeed. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=296.84s)]
*  Janis Dean, always so sunny. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=298.84s)]
*  She is. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=300.84s)]
*  And does Carly really know what crazy transitions you guys will throw at her? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=301.84s)]
*  She doesn't. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=305.58s)]
*  But she always has a snappy comeback. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=306.58s)]
*  And more importantly, I hear this all the time, does Brian Kilmeade really think we [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=310.28s)]
*  need somebody to get dressed? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=314.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=317.64s)]
*  Let me ask you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=318.64s)]
*  When you go out in the morning, are people on the street wearing clothes? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=319.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=324.08s)]
*  They are listening to Brian. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=325.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=326.08s)]
*  And Brian, that is your legacy. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=327.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=328.08s)]
*  That's all I need. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=329.08s)]
*  A lady at the airport said to me on Monday, she said, Steve, I didn't see you on the couch [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=330.08s)]
*  this morning. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=335.56s)]
*  And I told her that from now on, I was working three days a week. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=336.56s)]
*  And she said, that's great. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=341.0s)]
*  You've been there a long time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=342.44s)]
*  And she's right. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=343.72s)]
*  Because once again, according to AI, I have hosted 31,607 hours of live TV on Fox News. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=344.72s)]
*  You got your 10,000 in. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=353.88s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=355.16s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=356.16s)]
*  I'm not done yet. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  I will be back in 10 days when it's time to make the donuts. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=358.62s)]
*  And there you go. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=364.8s)]
*  Well, good job, Steve. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=365.8s)]
*  So you gave the lady the story? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=367.12s)]
*  That woman had the story. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  The lady at the airport. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  How are you feeling? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=372.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, any transition is just, I don't know what to expect tomorrow morning when [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't have to wake up at 3.30. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=380.12s)]
*  Oh, thank you, Stephanie Friedman. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=382.04s)]
*  Just got a congratulations. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=385.0s)]
*  Larry Kudlow's producer. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=386.96000000000004s)]

*  You don't have to tuck it in. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=688.24s)]
*  Steve, when I came here for my interview. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=689.24s)]
*  And no tie was the first one. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=691.24s)]
*  I was going up to Suzanne's office and you showed me how to use these crazy elevators. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=692.24s)]
*  Because I was from South Carolina and I never seen anything like this. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=696.24s)]
*  You taught me how to do it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=698.24s)]
*  I've been watching you for years and now you're my co-anchor. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=699.24s)]
*  God is so good. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=702.24s)]
*  And you're such a gentleman. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=703.24s)]
*  You always open the door for me. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=704.24s)]
*  You always walk behind me. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=705.24s)]
*  Yes, my husband said to me, who is going to take care of you when you go on trips with Fox and Friends? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=707.24s)]
*  Because Steve is always there to hold doors, to take luggage. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=712.24s)]
*  But Steve, I know that we're all going to experience, you know, not moving out of the city. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=716.24s)]
*  I know you're going to be in Florida with your wife and it's so exciting. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=721.24s)]
*  But when we all have to walk out of here and say goodbye, even though you're still going to be on the show. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=723.24s)]
*  But to move. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=728.24s)]
*  Three days a week. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=729.24s)]
*  I know that has to be difficult because everything in your life happened here. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=730.24s)]
*  That's right. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=734.24s)]
*  And all your children work here. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=735.24s)]
*  So I have this for you. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=736.24s)]
*  My kids grew up on TV. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=737.24s)]
*  You're going to be on the road. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=738.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=739.24s)]
*  And you pack lightly. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=740.24s)]
*  You'll take one suit. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=741.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=742.24s)]
*  And then you'll change your tie and change your shirt. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=743.24s)]
*  You don't need to. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=745.24s)]
*  I've got some shirts. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=746.24s)]
*  This is for your traveling coast. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=747.24s)]
*  Oh, thank you very much. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=748.24s)]
*  And Steve, I think that looking at your feet and concentrating on good foot health is going to be key because you're going to be on the road. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=749.24s)]
*  So this is the new hottest shoe. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=756.24s)]
*  The Hocus shoe provides optimum balance and quickness. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=758.24s)]
*  You're not going to believe how fast you're going to be in these shoes. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=762.24s)]
*  It's like a commercial. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=765.24s)]
*  And yeah, you will love them. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=766.24s)]
*  It provides a proper comfort. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=767.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to help your lumbar. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=769.24s)]
*  Those would be good. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=771.24s)]
*  Pickleball. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=772.24s)]
*  Do you want to do the gift from the team? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=773.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=775.24s)]

*  Those are good paddles. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=780.24s)]
*  And then, you know, a picture of us as well. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=781.24s)]
*  This is my favorite. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=783.24s)]
*  The kind bars because Stevie's kind bars every morning. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=784.24s)]
*  These are for all the grandkids right here. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=787.24s)]
*  Matching pajamas. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=790.24s)]
*  And you eat these every morning. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=792.24s)]
*  I do. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=795.24s)]
*  Now you can match the grandkids. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=796.24s)]

*  Kathy is so excited. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=803.24s)]
*  I'm going to still be working, but I'm only going to be working three days a week. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=804.24s)]
*  The problem is I'm going to be around her so much. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=806.24s)]
*  And that's the problem for her. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=808.24s)]
*  Listen, Steve, this is not going to be a problem. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTZCzIWwJrc&t=809.24s)]
