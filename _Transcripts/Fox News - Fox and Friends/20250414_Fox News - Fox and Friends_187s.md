# Gov. Shapiro speaks out after 'horrific' arson attack: 'IT HAS TO STOP'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A)
*  And police arresting and charging a man, they say, set fire to the governor of Pennsylvania, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=0.0s)]
*  Josh Shapiro's house, the governor's mansion, while the governor and his family were asleep [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=6.94s)]
*  inside the house. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=12.3s)]
*  Todd Pyro is here with all the details. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=14.46s)]
*  Hey Todd. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=16.26s)]
*  Absolutely horrific. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=17.26s)]
*  Good morning to all three of you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=18.26s)]
*  The governor now thanking officers for waking him up and responding quickly to save him [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=19.26s)]
*  and save his family. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=23.62s)]
*  Police believe the man scaled an iron security fence, the suspect that is, in the middle [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=24.98s)]
*  of the night to elude police and break into this home in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  Moments before it happened, Shapiro, who is Jewish, posted this message on X wishing [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=35.48s)]
*  everyone a happy Passover. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=41.24s)]
*  Now after the incident, he's condemning political acts of violence. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=43.24s)]
*  Last night we experienced an attack not just on our family, but on the entire Commonwealth [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=48.16s)]
*  of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=54.44s)]
*  This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=56.08s)]
*  And I don't give a **** if it's coming from one particular side or the other, directed [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=59.96s)]
*  at one particular party or another or one particular person or another. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=65.84s)]
*  It is not okay. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=71.36s)]
*  And it has to stop. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=74.08s)]
*  Vice President J.D. Vance responding to the fire saying, thanks be to God that Governor [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=76.52s)]
*  Shapiro and his family were unharmed in this attack. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=80.48s)]
*  Really disgusting violence and I hope whoever did it is brought swiftly to justice. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=83.8s)]
*  Police say the suspect, Cody Balmer, was found with homemade incendiary devices. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=88.92s)]
*  Investigators said they found beer bottles filled with gasoline inside the house. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  He's also accused of starting at least two fires using Molotov cocktails. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=97.96s)]
*  Balmer has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated arson and terrorism, among other [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=101.96s)]
*  charges. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=106.88s)]
*  But it really does beg the question, guys, whether it's President Trump or whether it's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=107.88s)]
*  We need to secure our leaders much better than I think we're currently doing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=112.28s)]
*  This individual should not have been able to make it into the governor's mansion like [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=116.64s)]
*  that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=119.8s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=120.8s)]
*  And Todd, no motive, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=121.8s)]
*  They haven't released whether or not this was hate crime. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=122.8s)]
*  At this point, no, but I'm sure one will ultimately come out. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=123.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=126.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=127.36s)]
*  Thank you, Todd. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=128.36s)]
*  I think his comments were spot on, though. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=129.36s)]
*  It was not a partisan speech after that happened. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=130.36s)]
*  We don't know the motives yet, but I just think it's so disgusting doing the start of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=133.72s)]
*  a Passover that for a Jewish family that the tools used there was to burn them up inside [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=137.8s)]
*  of their home. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  They got to get to the bottom of this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=147.16000000000003s)]
*  It seems like this is happening far too often. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=149.16000000000003s)]
*  The political violence just needs to end. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, if it is based on the fact that they're Jewish because it happened the night of the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=153.8s)]
*  Seder on Passover, that's a hate crime. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=158.44s)]
*  Maybe to Todd's point, there could be more charges. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=163.12s)]
*  That could be one of them. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=167.84s)]
*  We'll continue to keep you posted on that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=168.84s)]
*  It's very scary. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=169.84s)]
*  Imagine going to bed and waking up and your house is on fire and you have your children [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=170.84s)]
*  in the same house under the same roof. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5nMdbzQb9A&t=176.4s)]
