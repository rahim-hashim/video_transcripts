# Kamala Harris wants to ‘disguise’ her policy preferences: Kaylee McGhee White
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU)
*  Vice President Kamala Harris serving up a healthy dose of word salad in her sit down with Oprah. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=0.0s)]
*  We take pride in the privilege of being American. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=6.9s)]
*  And this is a moment where we can and must come together as Americans. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=12.68s)]
*  Let's come together with the character that we are so proud of about who we are, which [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=20.62s)]
*  is we are an optimistic people. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=27.1s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=29.1s)]
*  Just going to do this for you before we start. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=31.1s)]
*  I live in Glass House on that one. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=37.1s)]
*  Here to help us translate, Washington Examiner Deputy Editor Kaylee McGee White. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=39.1s)]
*  What do you make of this town hall? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=45.1s)]
*  I mean obviously this did not help her. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=47.1s)]
*  No and I don't know if I'm going to be much help translating. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=52.1s)]
*  I'm Gen Z so I have about a 15 second attention span so I lost her at about patriotism or [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=54.1s)]
*  whatever she was trying to say. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=59.1s)]
*  However I'm glad that we didn't hear about her lawn this time so that is a bit of an [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=61.1s)]
*  improvement. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=65.1s)]
*  But you know this is more rambling word salad from Kamala Harris and you compare this answer [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=67.1s)]
*  to an answer that Donald Trump gave back at a campaign rally in my home state of Michigan [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=73.1s)]
*  last week. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=78.1s)]
*  Both of these candidates were asked very directly about their economic plan. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=79.1s)]
*  His answer was so straight and direct he said that he's going to increase energy, lower [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=83.1s)]
*  interest rates and bring back common sense. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=88.1s)]
*  And then you compare that to what Kamala Harris just said. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=91.1s)]
*  And it's very clear why she's dropping in a lot of these swing states because she is [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=94.1s)]
*  incapable apparently of giving straight answers on policy questions. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=98.1s)]
*  How long can she get away with this? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=104.1s)]
*  All the way through the tape? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=106.1s)]
*  You think this is the strategy they'll employ? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=107.1s)]
*  I think so. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=111.1s)]
*  And I think it speaks to two things. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=112.1s)]
*  Either she legitimately doesn't know what she's talking about or she wants to avoid [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=114.1s)]
*  answering straight questions to disguise her policy preferences. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=118.1s)]
*  We know that she's apparently flip flopped on a number of these issues but has she or [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=122.1s)]
*  does she really hold the exact same leftist positions and she just doesn't want to admit [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=127.1s)]
*  that out loud. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=131.1s)]
*  All right, Kayleigh McGee-White, thanks for translating for us this morning on Fox with [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=133.1s)]
*  Friends. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=137.1s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XZeaMIaLzU&t=138.1s)]
