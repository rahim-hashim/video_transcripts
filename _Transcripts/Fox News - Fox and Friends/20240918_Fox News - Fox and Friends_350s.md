# Tulsi Gabbard: Democrats don't want voters to know this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw)
*  Independent Women's Voice launching the Riley Gaines stand with women's scorecard is happening today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=0.0s)]
*  It'll rate every candidate for federal office on whether they intend to support and protect female [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=4.96s)]
*  Opportunities not just in sports here with more independent women's voice ambassador and host of the games for girls podcast on outkick.com [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=11.52s)]
*  Riley Gaines and Trump transition team member a former congresswoman from Hawaii Tulsi Gabbard welcome to both of you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=18.76s)]
*  Riley, where'd you get this idea? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=25.88s)]
*  Well Brian always good to be on with you I got this idea, you know [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=28.88s)]
*  It's something I've been thinking about for the past two years now [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  It's unbelievable that we live in a time the year 2024 where we have to ask our elected leaders if they can even define the word [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=35.32s)]
*  Woman, but unfortunately, that's the reality that we're living in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=43.8s)]
*  So as you described I've partnered with independent women's voice to launch the Riley Gaines stand with women's scorecard [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=47.0s)]
*  As you said it merely just scores and convinced and those who are candidates running for federal office on [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=52.800000000000004s)]
*  If they stand with women we score this on how they have historically voted on the protection of women and girls in sports act [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=59.64s)]
*  the Title 9 Congressional Review Act for example [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=66.64s)]
*  Those again who are running if they have vowed to sign the stand with women commitment really simple stuff [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=69.88s)]
*  nothing complicated national polling consistently shows that over 70% of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=76.12s)]
*  Americans agree that on the women's sports issue, for example [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=80.92s)]
*  That men don't belong in women's sports. So why is there such a stark contrast on Capitol Hill, right? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=84.28s)]
*  You have a candidate said have signed the stand with women commitment [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=90.16s)]
*  Publicly then you have congressional a criteria for congressmen and women and one for Senate to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=92.84s)]
*  Tulsi as a transition team member and a key surrogate for the Trump team. How do you guys view this? I [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=98.64s)]
*  Mean this is an essential piece of information that voters need to have before they start heading to the polls [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=104.12s)]
*  We know early voting has already begun and I think there's a lot of Democrats who don't want voters to know [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=109.84s)]
*  That they don't in fact stand with women no matter how much they say they do they brush off this issue as though [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=116.48s)]
*  Oh, you know, this only affects a couple of people. It's not that serious [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=123.16s)]
*  You shouldn't pay attention to it, but we're seeing more and more young women and girls [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=127.12s)]
*  Who are directly impacted by this in not only impacting their ability to compete in sports on a fair and level playing field [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=132.44s)]
*  Which was the intent of title nine in the first place, but it affects their future opportunities as well when I was in Congress [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=139.28s)]
*  Brian I introduced a bipartisan piece of legislation [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=145.8s)]
*  I was a Democrat at that time with Senator then representative Mark Wayne Mullen called the protect women sports act and it very simply [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=149.12s)]
*  Clarified and upheld the intent of title nine. I was excoriated by Democrats for doing that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=157.24s)]
*  This is the kind of thing that voters need to know that Kamala Harris and the Democrats of today stand for against women and girls [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  All right, Riley is it frustrating for you that this has not come up on the debate stage is not come up in a conversation [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  The vice president has not been asked. Is it okay for you for boys to play in girls sports? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  Is it okay with you not to tell your parents if you want to transition is it okay that you are in some states? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=182.36s)]
*  They don't ask you what if your kid changed pronouns [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=188.36s)]
*  Beyond frustrating Brian, but I mean I think Tulsi hit the nail on the head what we have seen from Democratic leadership is they [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=194.08s)]
*  Desperately want to run from this issue. They know this is not a winning issue [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=201.24s)]
*  They know this issue does not pull in their favor and they know their voting record [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  For example, Senator John Tester in Montana who has [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=209.0s)]
*  Voted against protecting women and girls in sports. Yeah to me that doesn't represent [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=213.32s)]
*  Montana values and if that base knew that and of course [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=218.2s)]
*  This is a candidate who offered to pay female collegiate athletes for their endorsement if Montana knew that I believe they would be [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=221.96s)]
*  Appalled he knows that I know that the American public knows that and Tulsi you would think there's only one [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=227.88s)]
*  Issue that women care about and that's abortion, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=233.32s)]
*  Yeah, that that's the that's what Democrats want people to believe but when we look at the issues that concern not only [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=237.72s)]
*  Women but but you know the the fathers of young girls the mothers of young girls [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=244.6s)]
*  People who are directly being impacted by this what to speak of the broader issue here [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=250.2s)]
*  Brian which really is that the Democrats are rejecting these issues [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=255.32s)]
*  Of something that is objectively and biologically scientifically true [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=259.24s)]
*  It just exposes their their insanity of their positions on so many different issues [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=263.88s)]
*  There's a huge contrast in this that transcends partisan politics at the top of the ticket between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=268.6s)]
*  And in so many of these critical federal races for the US Senate and Congress [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=276.2s)]
*  So i'm glad that Riley is leading the charge here to to have this conversation [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=280.68s)]
*  I'm glad that Riley is leading the charge here to to have this scorecard [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=284.84s)]
*  So voters know before they head out and cast their votes transfix is great [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=289.79999999999995s)]
*  It's right now on Fox Nation check it out [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=293.4s)]
*  You see the little bug on the bottom of the screen [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=295.32s)]
*  But my exit question and what Riley gains hosting is a great job [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  But congresswoman, I got to ask you have you spoke to the trump team about should they win? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=300.52s)]
*  I know you're a transition team that you'd serve in the cabinet if asked [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=305.79999999999995s)]
*  Uh that we are all very very focused on winning this election getting out and reaching and speaking the truth about kamala harris's record [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=309.8s)]
*  And donald trump's record to voters [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=316.52s)]
*  Uh that will be an important task that will come after election day [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=318.84s)]
*  All right, that's not a no that means that you be relatively open to it, right? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9VKhIfCVw&t=322.36s)]
