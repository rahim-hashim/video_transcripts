# 'HELL TO PAY': Hamas refusing to release Gaza hostages as Trump's deadline inches closer
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA)
*  Welcome back and this morning there's growing frustration in Israel as Hamas terrorists once again refused to hand over any list of hostages [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=0.0s)]
*  To be set free as Trump warns [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=7.08s)]
*  As Trump's warning inches closer listen [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=10.0s)]
*  I'll be [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=13.64s)]
*  Very available on January 20th, and we'll see I as you know [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=16.2s)]
*  I gave warning that if these hostages aren't back home by that date all hell's gonna break out [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=21.68s)]
*  Yeah, Jim Hansen ran counterterrorism operations in the army special forces and he joins us now good morning [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=27.84s)]
*  Obviously, thank you for your service. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=34.6s)]
*  When we hear all hell is gonna break out over what's happening in Israel in Gaza [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=37.84s)]
*  Is that is that a threat that could actually cause change or are we gonna have to find out what that threat means? I? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=43.0s)]
*  I [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  Think Hamas is gonna find out that the Biden administration has been really slow rolling [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=51.72s)]
*  Everything Israel has tried to do in their response to the horrific acts of October 7th by Hamas and the ongoing [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=57.64s)]
*  You know keeping hostages as a negotiating tool. So while Gaza has been fairly well devastated [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=65.24s)]
*  the Israelis have done [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=72.8s)]
*  Considerably less than they're capable of because they needed our assistance [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=75.16s)]
*  So I think when President Trump says like something like that as you pointed out earlier in the show [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=79.39999999999999s)]
*  Posturing matters, you know when the the leaders of Hamas hear that that's a possibility [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=84.52s)]
*  They're more likely to make terms that are actually acceptable to the Israeli people [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=90.38s)]
*  Yeah, when we talk about the the main I guess linchpin right now that the the hanging point is this idea that they could get [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=95.16s)]
*  A list of hostages to be set free. I'll look at this to say it kind of looks like Hamas has the upper hand because it's real [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=101.52s)]
*  You know Netanyahu through their own people [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=109.8s)]
*  They're so desperate to get names to find out who may be alive who who may be a you know [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=111.72s)]
*  May have an opportunity to come back home [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=116.89999999999999s)]
*  It's almost like you're so hanging on to hope as far as the Israeli people go [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  That Hamas has more of a bargaining chip there, but on the other side, that's the only bargaining chip they have [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=123.52s)]
*  They've got no capabilities left what they have is that belief and Israel has shown over the years that they will go to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=129.4s)]
*  extraordinary lengths to secure the release of prisoners or hostages or [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=136.12s)]
*  Sadly to get their bodies back if they've already been killed. Yeah, and they don't know [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  Specifically and definitively who's alive and who's dead? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  So this war has been dragging on for a long time because of that, you know [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=149.96s)]
*  desire by the Israelis to get their people back and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=154.84s)]
*  I think that now who's under tremendous pressure, you know domestically to do whatever he can to get any remaining living hostages home [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=157.68s)]
*  I think they'll make some sort of deal and at the point where they find out who's alive and who's dead [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=164.8s)]
*  President Trump's words may come into play and there's hell to play for whoever's left in the Hamas leadership [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  You know one topic that's touching every conflict around the around the world to include the Middle East is drone warfare [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=177.0s)]
*  It's not just the war of the future [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  It's not just the war of the future [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  It is the current arms race we're in and there's no better way to explain how much we we don't understand than to talk about [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=187.11999999999998s)]
*  What's happened in New Jersey? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=193.32s)]
*  So we're being told now that President Biden called the Pentagon on four separate occasions and was told by the military that they had found nothing [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=194.83999999999997s)]
*  unusual which is [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=202.92s)]
*  Concerning to say the least considering the timeline of events and how there has been no information come out [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  What do you make of one the president having to call the Pentagon and to do it four times and to really get a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=209.84s)]
*  non-answer from them [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=215.44s)]
*  Yeah, I this is driving I think the entire country crazy, you know at some level there are drones flying around New Jersey [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=218.16s)]
*  Whose they are are they domestic? You know US government state local law enforcement maybe federal [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  You know law enforcement surveillance intelligence, or is it some sort of you know external state power? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=232.48s)]
*  I think that's less likely just because of the provocation level and what it takes to go ahead and do that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=238.32s)]
*  It would be a very edging towards a warlike act [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=244.6s)]
*  But what the problem in my mind that's even worse than that. We have a legitimate fear of drone warfare [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=248.64s)]
*  Nobody now can trust our government to tell us the truth [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=255.32s)]
*  I don't think anybody believes that we're getting straight answers and even Biden or whoever is operating the Biden puppet at this point [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=258.44s)]
*  It believes the answers they're getting and so no one can give a definitive answer to the American people about what's happening inside our own [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=265.04s)]
*  Country that's kind of horrifying at a level above even the drone [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  You know technology. No, that's a great point [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=276.88s)]
*  I mean the same man who said there and told us the border was closed the same people who told us that the spy [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=279.68s)]
*  Balloon couldn't transmit are telling us that these drones are no big deal. It kind of makes you believe the opposite [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=284.5s)]
*  Jim Hansen, thank you for your service and thanks for joining this morning. I appreciate your expertise [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzDyne3GdA&t=289.92s)]
