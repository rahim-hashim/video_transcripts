# 'THIS IS A FIRST': Judge ignites firestorm over bond for suspected cop killer
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw)
*  Carly outrage in Houston after a second suspect charged with the capital murder of a Texas deputy has a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=0.0s)]
*  $3 million bond set for his release the decision comes from the same judge who allowed the first suspect to be released [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=6.88s)]
*  After he posted a one million dollar bond [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=13.34s)]
*  Texas Deputy Fernando Esqueda was tracking down an assault suspect when officials say he was ambushed and shot multiple times by two shooters with a witness [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=15.82s)]
*  Placing both of the suspects at the scene [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=24.66s)]
*  Douglas Griffith is the Houston Police Union president and he joins me now Douglas [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=27.419999999999998s)]
*  Inexplicably this story has gotten worse somehow over the course of the last 24 hours with this news of the second suspect [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=31.979999999999997s)]
*  What's your reaction to now this second suspect having bonds set by the judge? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=38.839999999999996s)]
*  This is just abhorrent this judge has chosen to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=44.82s)]
*  provide rights for these [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=49.44s)]
*  Animals that gunned down a deputy and just [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=51.68s)]
*  Disregarded the safety of all the citizens of various County including the rest of the law enforcement officers that will have to deal with them at [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=56.0s)]
*  Some point in the future [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=61.56s)]
*  They were given a bond when they could have easily been held without bond and waited for their trial date [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  This officer this deputy gave his life for our community yet [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=69.16s)]
*  She's gonna turn her back on the community and just allow us to get us to walk free [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=74.74s)]
*  Prosecutors actually filed to have Francis Doraemon Francis the first suspect in this case [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  Held without bond but that hearing on the bond wasn't held within 10 days, which is required by the law [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=86.0s)]
*  So the judge was reportedly forced to set this bond that said did she have any other? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=91.64s)]
*  Recourse to keep these guys from heading out on the streets [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=97.96s)]
*  Absolutely, he's a multiple he had multiple bonds he's out of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  Lengthy criminal history she could have held him. There is no [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  Force mechanism to not hold them in jail [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  It's completely up to her the problem is she's allowed at least at a minimum of eight other suspects [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  To go out on bond who turned around and murdered someone after she let them out [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=126.96s)]
*  That's eight others that could still be on the streets today had she not done it now [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=132.16s)]
*  When these guys don't come to court because it's a capital murder case [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=136.60000000000002s)]
*  Then we're gonna be forced to go out there and get them again, and then they can gun down another officer [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=140.08s)]
*  There were 42 rounds fired at Deputy Esqueda [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=145.32000000000002s)]
*  These are violent offenders they we are going to see them again in the headlines of the news [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=150.88s)]
*  It's all gonna be on this judge's back. Yeah, we always do see him again the repeat offenders [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=155.26000000000002s)]
*  Like you said, this is not a one-and-done. Here's what your governor said about this rogue judge Hillary Unger [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=159.62s)]
*  That's the judge's name here released a cop killer back on the streets. This is outrageous [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=165.2s)]
*  Activist judges like Unger don't deserve to sit on the bench Texas needs bail reform [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=170.16s)]
*  So dangerous criminals stay behind bars [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=174.72s)]
*  Douglas are you optimistic that this will be the case that creates the outroar the uproar? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  To lead to change so that suspects like this are behind bars when they are accused of doing something like this [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=183.6s)]
*  Well, the point thing is this is the second judge that has done this [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=191.72s)]
*  We had an officer killed officer Jeffries was killed a couple years ago when a judge a rogue judge [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  Greg glass released a guy on multiple felony bonds. He went out ended up killing our officer [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  Here we are again a few years later a different judge same story [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=207.83999999999997s)]
*  We've seen this over and over in Erich County [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=211.88s)]
*  We are sick of it the citizens are sick of it because in reality [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  The main people you're putting jeopardy of the citizens of Erich County hundred percent Douglas Griffin. Thank you for your time [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  Just want to make one note that your union put out there this individual Draymond Francis [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=224.08s)]
*  We'll be calling the first suspect claims to be indigent [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=228.60000000000002s)]
*  But somehow posted that million dollar bond raises some questions about how that happened Douglas. Absolutely. Thank you very much for your time [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=231.46s)]
*  So a man charged with the capital murder of a Texas police officer has been released on bond the first time someone has been [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=238.8s)]
*  Released with such a serious charge and over 20 years [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  That suspect is now in house arrest the former district attorney Kim Og joins us now [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=248.56s)]
*  Kim thanks so much for joining the program. I look at this case. You got two guns [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=253.78s)]
*  You got a cop this ambush over 40 cases on the scene and you release him with a ankle monitor [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=257.26s)]
*  Our judges unfortunately in Harris County have shown a pattern of releasing repeat violent offenders among us [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=265.7s)]
*  Right now there are more than [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=273.53999999999996s)]
*  830 [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=276.09999999999997s)]
*  fugitives or [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=277.5s)]
*  individuals on bond [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=278.78s)]
*  For capital murder or murder but LJ none for the murder of a police officer [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=280.70000000000005s)]
*  This is a first for us. How did this happen? I just want to understand the psychology [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=286.74s)]
*  Behind the thinking from the judge that the new DA not pushed back and say [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=292.3s)]
*  I'm representing not only the state of Texas, but law enforcement as well. This was an ambush [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=297.98s)]
*  We know the ankle monitors don't work there. They're monitored by private companies [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=303.86s)]
*  This is just not safe for our community [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=308.54s)]
*  Not safe is an understatement with [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=312.65999999999997s)]
*  830 fugitives or individuals on bond for murder and capital murder [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=315.62s)]
*  We know the average person in the public is in danger [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=319.98s)]
*  What the thinking of the judge was we see docket entries where there's statements that the judge had to set a bond [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=324.62s)]
*  That is true in certain circumstances [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=332.21999999999997s)]
*  But she could have set a bond that was high enough to protect the public [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=334.82000000000005s)]
*  Unfortunately, judge Hillary Unger is a rogue judge and notorious for releasing repeat offenders who go out and kill other [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=341.14000000000004s)]
*  Members of our community. We've got to stop these rogue judges [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=349.5s)]
*  I was attacked as DA for fighting against this type of activity by our local judges right now [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=353.42s)]
*  We appear to have a DA that's complacent and okay with it [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=359.62s)]
*  I don't know how she's a judge in our home state of Texas [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=363.0s)]
*  I just I don't understand how someone who is a part of the court [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=365.64s)]
*  Who's a part of the criminal justice system would be okay by the way? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=371.88s)]
*  Kim how did he pay this bond? That's a hundred thousand dollars if we're doing the math, right? Ten percent of one million dollars [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=376.84s)]
*  Well, he clearly wasn't an average [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=385.68s)]
*  Criminal defendant he had access to money to make this type of bond ten percent [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=388.88s)]
*  Charged by the bonding companies is standard [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=395.0s)]
*  But this is insult upon injury to the fallen officer's family to know that their loved ones [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=397.52s)]
*  Murderer is free today in his home under quote house arrest [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=405.24s)]
*  We know that those GPS monitors simply give the public a false sense of security [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=411.28s)]
*  When in truth they provide none [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=416.52s)]
*  Kim, what is the new DA doing? I mean they didn't want to reelect you because they said you were too moderate [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=419.76s)]
*  You don't want open borders. You don't want criminal [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=425.4s)]
*  Defendants back on the street you cooperated with the feds. So what is this new DA doing? He wanted the job [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=428.04s)]
*  He has it. Did he push back? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=434.86s)]
*  Well, it's unclear to me whether he did anything at all [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=438.12s)]
*  Judges set bonds in Texas. They are exclusively responsible [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=442.91999999999996s)]
*  DA should be fighting for public safety. That's what my administration was doing [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  They've sought to blame the prosecutor in this case for not pushing forward [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=453.03999999999996s)]
*  Let me tell you judges set the schedules in trials. They set the bonds for the defendants. They have important responsibilities and that is their record and this is [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=456.91999999999996s)]
*  Unfortunately judge Unger's pattern and practice [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  You [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_IOMDcZIw&t=471.96s)]
