# Trump ramps up migrant crackdown following anti-ICE protests: 'Must expand efforts'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM)
*  So this morning President Trump letting those anti-ice protesters know he's had enough [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump posting quote we must expand efforts to detain and deport illegal aliens in America's largest cities such as LA Chicago and New York [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=5.78s)]
*  Where millions of illegal aliens reside? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=14.26s)]
*  I have directed my entire administration to put every resource possible behind the effort and reverse the tide of mass destruction [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=16.6s)]
*  Destruction migration up New York City mayor Eric Adams joins us now [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=24.48s)]
*  And miss mayor fifty thousand came out for the no Kings Day over the weekend. There was really no incidents [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=28.3s)]
*  34,000 NYPD officers out there. What was your approach? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  Did you learn anything from the way LA didn't handle it the way you handled it? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=38.6s)]
*  And also the when you had marches in the past [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=42.42s)]
*  And this was a very unique March where you had people coming from different parts of the city [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=45.52s)]
*  50,000 14 arrests [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  No injuries to any member of service or to the protesters and what's important? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=53.4s)]
*  We use technology drones that allowed us to monitor the entire crowd and Intel [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  We knew that there were outside agitators that wanted to disrupt [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=63.6s)]
*  They were met someone wearing masks and covering and we zeroed in on them [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=68.16s)]
*  We were very proactive in this entire prepare for something that large and tell us about the people that were arrested were they violent? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=72.24s)]
*  No, they they committed [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=79.6s)]
*  Disorderly conduct type crimes of several them received some as is others received desk appearances tickets and one actually went through the system [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=81.48s)]
*  so what we did differently is that number one of drones were amazing because it allowed us to police this not only from the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  Ground but in the air if you see a crowd of people with gas masks on face mask on now [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=96.86s)]
*  We had our folks watching them and stand stand in contact with what they were doing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=102.64s)]
*  So we were going after those numbers that were trying to make of the premise of the marches because they're saying as a cop [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=107.68s)]
*  They're saying until the ice race stop then they're not gonna stop [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=114.64s)]
*  So they're gonna prevent the race from happening, which is what started in LA [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=118.68s)]
*  They have a lawful warrant signed by just to pick people up and they're saying they're gonna impede it [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  And they're gonna continue to protest until those stop and watch what happened here in the city [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  I can't speak for the municipalities, but I was clear with the Commissioner and Commission was clear with her troops [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=132.68s)]
*  You're not going to impede [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=137.6s)]
*  Federal authorities for taking their actions and that's what we were able to accomplish [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=139.8s)]
*  So when you were those who were sitting in the roadway blocking trucks blocking protesters or blocking [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=144.1s)]
*  Parents from wanting to go to the job as we saw one of those videos. It's not going to happen in the city [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=149.32s)]
*  We took the right actions throughout this entire initiative [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=154.6s)]
*  I communicated with the governor and the administration to say in New York City [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=157.84s)]
*  We have the manpower to handle this problem. So let's talk about the race [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=163.12s)]
*  You're not going for the Democratic nomination because you got elected as a Democrat [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=166.32s)]
*  You said I'm gonna run as an independent and you might be open to Republicans [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  But there was a big debate over the last few days or mom Donnie and Cuomo is our one in two in this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=174.16s)]
*  Here's AOC to show I divided the Democrats are here's AOC talking about how Cuomo is the problem [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=179.76s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo has made clear that if he wins this race, he wants to run for president of the United States [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=187.0s)]
*  And in a world and a nation that is crying to end the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=197.32s)]
*  Gerontocracy of our leadership [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=204.84s)]
*  That wants a new day that wants to see a new generation [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=207.72s)]
*  Ascend it is unconscionable to send Andrew Cuomo to Gracie Mansion once again [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=213.2s)]
*  He and mom Donnie is what she supports who's the socialist who wants to give away everything the fund the police the fund of and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=220.88000000000002s)]
*  The fund the police your reaction to these New Yorkers, you know, I equate this like the basketball [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=226.72000000000003s)]
*  This is the season the playoff is going to happen after its primary. They're going to be appeared three people in the playoff [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  Andrew and Donnie and Eric Adams and Curtis Lee what the New York Times came out today and say don't do my Donnie don't do [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  Quiet Cuomo I told this city around they don't want to admit it [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=249.0s)]
*  That's fine [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=253.12s)]
*  But the voters are going to acknowledge that and I want to want to be on the ground [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=253.8s)]
*  You can't defund police you can't be anti-business [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=257.2s)]
*  You can't start raising taxes when you don't have the authority to do so and so [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=260.04s)]
*  Having a clear message is going to be an interesting campaign season [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=265.68s)]
*  I think mr. May a lot of people waiting for the moment you take off the gloves [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=269.14s)]
*  Because you got a Democratic Party that tried to crush you [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  All because you want to cooperate with the president of the United States all because they were trying to bankrupt this city having illegals in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=276.24s)]
*  This in this town you have to do the hotels [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=283.68s)]
*  Provide food housing then crime billions. It was out of control [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=287.8s)]
*  So are you gonna expose what they tried to do to you? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=291.56s)]
*  over and over again because you're right what they tried to do and it's very clear and then the hole up the dismissal into the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=296.32s)]
*  day before the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=303.68s)]
*  Submission of my petition. I had 25,000 petitions judge whole held up [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=306.04s)]
*  To dismissal that his independent person stayed into the day before [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=311.44s)]
*  That's why we had to run on an independent line and raise more [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=315.16s)]
*  Petitions in the street, of course, there's a lot of money. And so it's about sharing what happened [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=320.12s)]
*  Why I fought for New Yorkers I'll say over and over again. They weren't coming for me [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=326.16s)]
*  They were coming from the people in the city and I was in the way and now I'm going to be [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  Your party turned on you. Yes [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=335.92s)]
*  And let's think about this for a moment in all of our parties [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6J0ko2XcHM&t=338.76s)]
