# There's no better anti-poverty program than a job: Ex-CA state assemblyman
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk)
*  A former homeless California resident who moved to Texas is now admitting why she is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=0.0s)]
*  moving her family back to California, telling Business Insider, quote, we pay for all our [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=4.46s)]
*  utilities here, which I've never done in California. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=9.38s)]
*  Plus, I went from making almost $18 an hour in California to $11 here in Texas. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=12.16s)]
*  Our next guest will be sounding the alarm out of the out of control government handouts. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  When he testifies on Capitol Hill this week, Chuck DeVore is a former California state [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=21.32s)]
*  assemblyman who left for Texas and he joins us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=24.98s)]
*  So Chuck, the argument, I guess, from this couple is, hey, Texas sounded great, cheaper [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=28.2s)]
*  cost of living, big houses, lower price, but I guess they didn't like it because they didn't [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=33.48s)]
*  have as many subsidized costs of living as they get in California. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  Well, yes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=43.36s)]
*  And the problem, Will, is it doesn't work even with all the handouts. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=45.5s)]
*  California since 2009 has had the nation's highest supplemental poverty rate. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=49.4s)]
*  This is a new, it used to be a new rate of poverty that looked into poverty and included [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=55.36s)]
*  the cost of living and the value of non-cash government handouts. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=61.08s)]
*  And when you include all of the stuff that they give people, the Section 8 housing vouchers [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=65.8s)]
*  and food stamps, who are now called SNAP, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=70.32s)]
*  you include all of those government assistance. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=75.84s)]
*  California has had the nation's highest poverty rate since 2009, even with all those handouts. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=79.0s)]
*  And here's the other problem. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=85.64s)]
*  The cost of living in California is about 56 percent higher than it is in Texas. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=86.56s)]
*  So if you make, let's say, $11 an hour in Texas, you have to make over $17 an hour in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=92.8s)]
*  California just to have the same buying power. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=98.6s)]
*  And so the other thing about that, Will, is that that higher cost of living in California, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=102.08s)]
*  the nation's highest electrical costs, the nation's highest gasoline prices, that's a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=106.68s)]
*  preview of coming attractions with Vice President Harris and her inflationary policies that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=111.48s)]
*  she's going to carry over from President Biden. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=118.24s)]
*  Yeah, and the rest of the Californians, in the case of Harris and Walz, the rest of America [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=120.76s)]
*  has to pay for all of that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=127.0s)]
*  So there's the effect on poverty, but then the cost on everyone else living in that society. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=128.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=134.36s)]
*  You know, there's no better anti-poverty program than a good job. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=136.36s)]
*  And so that's why we see now even the official poverty rate and the supplemental poverty [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  rate are higher now under Biden-Harris than they were in 2019, just before the pandemic [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=145.96s)]
*  under President Trump. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=153.52s)]
*  Well, I got to leave it here, Chuck, but we appreciate you being with us this morning. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=154.52s)]
*  Stick around. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  More Fox and Friends coming up. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu1IPT2zNxk&t=158.48000000000002s)]
