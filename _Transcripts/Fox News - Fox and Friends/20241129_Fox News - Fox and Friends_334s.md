# Volleyball team with trans player reaches tournament final after another opponent forefit
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg)
*  All right, so we've been talking a lot about them for maybe for the first time [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Mountain West Conference volleyball championship and there is a obvious reason to it [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=4.32s)]
*  It's because one of the teams and Jose State University does have a transgender gender player on the team [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=10.76s)]
*  and this is the conference championship right now and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=16.32s)]
*  What's happening what happened throughout the regular season is that many teams? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Forfeited their games because they didn't want to play against this one particular transgender individual [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  So they said they took a stand and said we're not gonna play which means that San Jose State won the game [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=30.44s)]
*  So much so that they enter the conference championship with the first week by which really helped them out and then the second game [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=35.24s)]
*  the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=43.28s)]
*  Boise State I believe it was forfeited the match and now they're sailing through to the final tomorrow [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=44.68000000000001s)]
*  So how about that what's gonna happen with this that game? We don't know but if that team [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=52.04s)]
*  Ultimately forfeits then that means that San Jose State wins [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=58.08s)]
*  Here's the problem it doesn't recognize first of all the danger [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=63.04s)]
*  I think people may not remember there was a circumstance where a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=68.58s)]
*  Transgender player was playing and I think spiked the ball and really hurt a girl [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=73.36s)]
*  I believe it may have been a high school level, but my point for the story is simply this it is inherently unfair [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=79.56s)]
*  they know it and I applaud the young women who are standing in solidarity and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=86.12s)]
*  Saying this is a slippery slope if we're gonna do co-ed and then that's one thing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=91.32s)]
*  But if you're gonna have different players, what happens? Let me just ask it this way [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=95.64s)]
*  What happens if the next time or the next year there are six transgender players on that team? How do you think they'll do it? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=99.68s)]
*  We're gonna have six transgender basketball players on a team now you really begin to tip the balance of competition [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=107.0s)]
*  And I think that's what the players are saying as they step aside and forfeit these contests [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=113.96s)]
*  Yeah, and a lot of people are coming out with opinions on this yesterday [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=118.72s)]
*  We covered the Washington Post article that I think was atrocious today. We've got this quote from Nancy Armour [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=122.16s)]
*  She wrote an op-ed in the USA today [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=127.8s)]
*  She says for all the shrieking there is about transgender women athletes is the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  Cisgender women it's the cisgender women pushing the forfeits who cost their fellow athletes [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=136.12s)]
*  opportunities to play and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  Saddled their teams with losses. It's those women not the San Jose State player who are the real threat [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=145.32s)]
*  I you know, this is called gaslighting [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  I think the Washington Post article yesterday was just as bad if not worse [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  And what they're doing is they're blaming the women who have the courage to stand up and saying that they are [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=157.12s)]
*  Essentially the the culprit or they're they're the problem here as you just heard. I think it's really important [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=163.12s)]
*  I feel bad even for the girls playing on the San Jose State team because if they [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=168.72s)]
*  You know their entire college career in playing volleyball is going to be dominated by this anything they accomplish will have an asterix [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=173.16000000000003s)]
*  and it's tough because [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  Women did fight to have some sort of opportunity in sports title nine is the thing because someone brought it [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=181.72s)]
*  That's right brought it up and advocated for it [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=187.28s)]
*  And what's really ironic about this is the majority of these pushing back or pushing back even against the sentiment of title nine saying that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=189.68s)]
*  Women as a gender don't deserve their own place in sports. Mm-hmm [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=196.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's so true [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  And this woman who wrote the op-ed said that the Cisgender meaning that the straight women [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=201.6s)]
*  Are pushing the forfeits who cost their fellow or athletes opportunities [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=206.44s)]
*  What what's really happening is that the teams are coming together and they're making the collective decision [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=210.26000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and saying, you know what sometimes for the future of our sport it's not about winning this individual tournament [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=215.28s)]
*  It's about making that sacrifice for fairness down the road. That's right. So [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  They're standing up [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=228.64s)]
*  but I think it's I think it's really a selfless act to do that and forfeit and I [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=229.73999999999998s)]
*  Don't know how San Jose State as a team will feel if they win by not not ever really playing right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=235.0s)]
*  So at some point I think that individual player [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=240.96s)]
*  That this controversy is surrounded by needs to think about what brought them to this point [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  That is the key for me, too [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  You said the perfect word fairness [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=250.96s)]
*  It is inherently unfair to tip the scales in one direction over another because as I pointed out if [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=253.32000000000002s)]
*  There's six or five on the court and they're jumping out of the gym people say oh Kevin [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  You're taking it a bridge too far. This is one individual player [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=267.2s)]
*  She deserves the opportunity to compete good go compete do what you want to do [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=270.52s)]
*  But understand that you as an individual player are making an impact [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=274.94s)]
*  Not just on all the players around you who are on that team for San Jose State [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=279.23999999999995s)]
*  But you're impacting the opportunities and the careers [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=283.23999999999995s)]
*  Perhaps of the other young women who are gonna try to get into this tournament [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=286.35999999999996s)]
*  It's not just what happens on the court of volleyball a lot of the young girls who have come out and spoken out against this [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=289.84s)]
*  Listen we have to go into that locker room and as far as they are concerned, that's a male [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=295.86s)]
*  That's right and going into that locker room with a male to be in their most vulnerable [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=301.46s)]
*  Moments undressing or what have you is incredibly uncomfortable if not scary to them. They're not bad people [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=305.82s)]
*  They're not bigots for feeling that way [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=312.58s)]
*  It's a very visceral and human reaction and I think it should be respected and I think that I think that this is all part [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=314.1s)]
*  Of this tide that's coming back towards common sense. I'm Steve juicy. I'm Brian kill me [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4X1PPNBvg&t=321.5s)]
