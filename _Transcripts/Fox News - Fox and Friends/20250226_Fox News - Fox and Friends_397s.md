# Karoline Leavitt unveils new 'shakeup' at White House: 'Long overdue'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE)
*  So President Trump's first cabinet meeting will take place today and Elon Musk is expected [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=0.0s)]
*  to be there. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=9.88s)]
*  Joining us right now, White House Press Secretary Caroline Levin. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=11.4s)]
*  Congratulations, my friend. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=14.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=17.2s)]
*  You've been making a lot of news at these briefings. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=18.2s)]
*  This is the first cabinet meeting. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk is going to be there. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=21.68s)]
*  I know there's been a lot of talk about the emails asking about the productivity. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=23.76s)]
*  Is he going to be asking the cabinet members for an update today? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=29.24s)]
*  Well first of all, we're so excited that President Trump is hosting his first cabinet meeting [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=32.68s)]
*  here at the White House with the phenomenal team that he has put together. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=36.6s)]
*  Every single one of his cabinet heads will be here today, both confirmed and soon to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=40.599999999999994s)]
*  be confirmed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=45.86s)]
*  And Elon Musk will be in attendance at the cabinet meeting as well because Doge is working [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=46.86s)]
*  alongside every single one of these cabinet secretaries to identify waste, fraud, and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=51.72s)]
*  abuse at their respective agencies. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=57.28s)]
*  So they will be providing updates on some of the waste and fraud that they found and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  they'll also be talking about their initiatives and the policies that they are enacting across [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  the federal government to deliver on the promises President Trump made to the American people. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=67.84s)]
*  From my view, it looks like the cabinet secretaries are already working with Elon Musk when it [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=72.0s)]
*  comes to cutting waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=77.28s)]
*  Some of the reporting was coming out saying that the cabinet members did not want to comply [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=79.84s)]
*  with the latest email that he sent out, but we're hearing it was because of national security [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=84.16s)]
*  Well, first of all, all of the reporting that says there's chaos or there isn't team unity [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=89.72s)]
*  is based on anonymous sources. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  If you talk to these cabinet secretaries, which you and many other reporters in that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=95.55999999999999s)]
*  room today will have the opportunity to do, you will see that this is a unified effort [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=99.16s)]
*  and everybody is on board with President Trump's promise to identify this waste and fraud. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  You look at what Lee Zeldin has found at the EPA, $20 billion that the Democrats pushed [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=108.83999999999999s)]
*  out the door in the final weeks of Joe Biden's presidency. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=114.16s)]
*  $2 billion of that went to an NGO that was run by Stacey Abrams. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=117.24s)]
*  So there is real fraud taking place in our federal government. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=120.96s)]
*  Or look at what Kelly Loeffler has done at SBA. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=124.0s)]
*  She demanded that the workforce return to the office. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=126.6s)]
*  80% of SBA employees are back in the office because of her leadership and her efforts. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=129.28s)]
*  And she put out a phenomenal video to talk about it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=134.16s)]
*  You look across the board, all of these cabinet secretaries are working alongside Elon and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  of course the president at his directive to make our federal government more efficient. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=141.44s)]
*  So Caroline, let's talk about some of the other breaking news. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=146.12s)]
*  I know the president as well as the president of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky, were going [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=148.36s)]
*  back and forth. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  The president wants a deal to be done. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  We're hearing news that Zelensky could be at the White House to sign some deal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=157.28s)]
*  What can you share with us? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=162.56s)]
*  Well, what I can share is what the president has said, which is the critical minerals, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=163.72000000000003s)]
*  rare earths deal is absolutely necessary and pivotal. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  It will recoup American tax dollars. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=171.72000000000003s)]
*  We've funded more than $300 billion to Ukraine's national defense. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  It will provide these very critical minerals and rare earth minerals to the United States [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=178.16s)]
*  of America for our own national security. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=182.84s)]
*  It will also create an incredible economic partnership between the American people and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=185.12s)]
*  the Ukrainian people who are going to need to rebuild their country after this brutal [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  war once it ends. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  So this is a significant step towards peace. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=194.68s)]
*  We expect the deal to be signed this week. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=196.84s)]
*  And as President Trump said yesterday, if Zelensky wants to come to this White House [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  to sign that deal, he is open to that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  Do you think he's going to come to show up to sign some sort of deal? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  We hope that he will, as President Trump said. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  Tell me the latest about the meeting with Putin. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=210.28s)]
*  Is that a go just yet? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=212.68s)]
*  There's nothing on the books just yet. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=215.24s)]
*  The president will continue to keep everybody informed on that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  But I know that Steve Wittkopf and Secretary Rubio and our national security advisor, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  Mike Walz and the president's entire delegation, who he's tasked with ending this [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=225.12s)]
*  conflict, continue to be engaged with the Russians as well as the Ukrainians. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=229.76s)]
*  You have to talk to both sides to bring the war to an end. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=233.8s)]
*  The president had direct dialogue with Putin, and he has said that he believes both [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=236.28s)]
*  sides of this war want to see it end. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=240.52s)]
*  It's in the interest of both of these countries to stop the killing and to ensure that we [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=242.44s)]
*  can have a peaceful world and economic prosperity for all. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=246.72s)]
*  So, Caroline, you made some headlines yesterday. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=249.88s)]
*  I know the president, he talks to all type of media, even some of the people that don't [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=252.6s)]
*  even like him. He's willing to give them interviews. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=256.84s)]
*  Gives them the first scoop sometimes. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=259.48s)]
*  Yesterday, you announced that the White House press office would be and the president will [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=261.76s)]
*  be selecting the pool reporters going forward. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=266.48s)]
*  What is that process going to look like going forward? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=270.48s)]
*  So for your audience, who may not understand what has happened at this White House for [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=273.16s)]
*  decades, you have a group of journalists based here in Washington, D.C., who dictate [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=277.24s)]
*  which reporters go into the most intimate spaces of the American presidency, the Oval [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=282.12s)]
*  Office, who gets to ride on Air Force One. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=286.96s)]
*  And that system hasn't changed since the early 1900s. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=289.44s)]
*  Obviously, the media today in 2025 looks a heck of a lot different than it did when the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=293.08s)]
*  White House Correspondence Association was formed. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=297.4s)]
*  So this is a long overdue change. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=299.47999999999996s)]
*  A lot of press secretaries and White Houses have talked about making this change. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=301.68s)]
*  We are just the first to do it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=305.32s)]
*  We're shaking up Washington in more ways than one. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=306.67999999999995s)]
*  And so moving forward, we're going to expand the pool's access to the president, to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=309.0s)]
*  our non-traditional journalists. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=314.8s)]
*  Legacy media will still have a seat, just like they still have a seat in our briefing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  room. But we're going to bring new voices into the fold. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=320.96s)]
*  The only people who are upset about this are those who feel like it's a knock on their [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=323.4s)]
*  power that they've had over the system. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=327.36s)]
*  The power belongs to the people, not elitist journalists in Washington, D.C. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=329.2s)]
*  Is the president doing this because of all the podcasts that were so instrumental in [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=332.76s)]
*  the YouTube shows that were instrumental during his last election win? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=338.76s)]
*  Well, we've made a lot of changes to the press operation here because of that successful [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=344.0s)]
*  effort. The president owned the non-traditional media lane. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  Those podcasts were some of the most successful ratings bonanza that those podcast [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  hosts have ever seen when Donald Trump joined their shows. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  And so we want to continue that effort because that's how you reach a bulk of America [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  today. They're not tuning in to the legacy media outlets. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=362.88s)]
*  They are listening to their podcasts when they drive to work. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=365.88s)]
*  They are reading non-traditional outlets and digital sites. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  And so those voices deserve a seat at the table. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=371.32s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to do here. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  Caroline Levitt here at the White House. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=375.23999999999995s)]
*  I look forward to seeing you later on in the cabinet room in the Oval to interview the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=378.0s)]
*  president as well as the rest of the cabinet. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=382.4s)]
*  It's going to be a lot of fun. Thanks for being here. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  We appreciate it. Congratulations. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM84OtTIULE&t=385.59999999999997s)]
