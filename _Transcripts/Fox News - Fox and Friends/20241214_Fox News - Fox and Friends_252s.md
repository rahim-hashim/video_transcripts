# Kirby is 'being a little opaque' and 'intentionally so' over mystery drones: Kevin Corke
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU)
*  Here's John Kirby on with Martha McCallum and try and find an answer as to what's going on in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=0.0s)]
*  And what he says watch this? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=6.08s)]
*  Why not just take one down and figure out what's going on? Well, you okay the idea of taking something down again [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=8.64s)]
*  You get what you want to worry about public safety [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=14.24s)]
*  First of all, we don't have enough conclusions to take that kind of a policy action [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  But let's just assume for a minute Martha that we did [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  I mean, you're not gonna want to shoot something down where it could hit somebody's house or or hurt [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=22.42s)]
*  The Coast Guard says that there are 30 of them following one of their ships in the ocean. So would that work? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=26.639999999999997s)]
*  I mean again [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=31.06s)]
*  We we have to develop the policy options based on what we know we're dealing with here [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  And we just don't know enough to make those kinds of to take those kinds of actions [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=36.82s)]
*  Have you called in like AI experts or said like why don't we ask Elon Musk what he thinks or you know brought in outside? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=40.28s)]
*  Experts we're working really hard right now inside our inner in the interagency and certainly supporting the FBI and DHS as they investigate this [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=46.28s)]
*  Look Johnson Pentagon guy [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=55.6s)]
*  He knows exactly what's going on in this and they're not being completely candid and I can say that in this respect [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=57.08s)]
*  When he says we're working on it [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=63.56s)]
*  What about following the ship? I think Martha made a brilliant point and he's saying well, you know [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=66.48s)]
*  We still don't know exactly what all the contingency plans might entail [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=70.74s)]
*  listen, let me tell you something if there's an actual threat of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=75.24s)]
*  US military personnel and or [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=78.96s)]
*  armament equipment [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=82.2s)]
*  They're gonna break that thing down. I can tell you that right now [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=84.16s)]
*  So in this particular case, he's being a little opaque and I think he's intentionally show intentionally. So real quick [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=86.64s)]
*  I want to share this this is Dawn Fantasia [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=93.56s)]
*  She's the New Jersey Assemblywoman and she sort of responds to this sort of cat-and-mouse game that you heard Kirby playing there [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=95.64s)]
*  with Martha McCallum [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=102.84s)]
*  When you have spokesmodels coming out of the White House like Admiral Kirby directly [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=105.12s)]
*  Conflicting with eyewitness accounts and not just civilian accounts. We have eyewitness accounts from military personnel [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=110.5s)]
*  We have spokespeople from the military from Naval Base Earl in Monmouth County [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  From Picatinny Arsenal up in my neck of the woods on the border of Sussex and Morris counties when you have those individuals [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=122.5s)]
*  Confirming these when you have the Colonel of the New Jersey State Police Patrick Callahan [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=129.82s)]
*  Flying up his men in a helicopter to do surveillance and noting that these drones are six feet in diameter [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=135.44000000000003s)]
*  That they turn off their lights and then they become undetectable and then you have a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  Spokesmodel out of the White House saying these things. It's nonsense. It does nothing but cause public chaos [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=148.28s)]
*  You know, I just think there's only the only logical conclusion we can get to the one you alluded to earlier Kevin it [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=155.12s)]
*  They're ours [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=160.96s)]
*  Yeah, and they're from an intel agency and they're not telling anyone including local authorities which leads to I think the most important question [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=162.0s)]
*  Why what are you doing? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=169.04s)]
*  What would what would we be doing in our intel agencies be doing over New Jersey with all these drones? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=170.6s)]
*  And just since the election to this is all happening what three weeks ago? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=176.44s)]
*  And it's been going on for weeks now [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=181.12s)]
*  And to me it would seem to be as a matter of course you would not only want to interdict [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=183.3s)]
*  Obviously could be a problem. They were talking about public safety [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  Let me tell you something if you have several drones dozens of drones who knows how many up there [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=191.55999999999997s)]
*  Isn't that a concern for public safety? You can't have John Kirby on the one hand say well [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=196.92s)]
*  We can't bring it down Martha because of public safety. We're worried about public safety right now [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  And I yeah and and Martha saying well the Coast Guard did come out and say that there are [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=205.2s)]
*  12 to 30 drones that were following one of their ships [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  So what it just could be on concerning in and of itself? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  If you do shoot it down do shoot it down over the ocean [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=215.48s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know though will I mean people are so worried about this and they're flying at a low level [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=218.4s)]
*  So why would a federal agency make something that they're doing so obvious and just focus on the New Jersey area? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=225.92s)]
*  It's it's just so strange [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  I just don't I don't know what it what it could possibly be in and that's the big issue. Yeah [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm Steve juicy [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwtE6Q-UdAU&t=241.07999999999998s)]
