# Democrats to spend millions in 'liberal Joe Rogan' search
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg)
*  The Democrats still don't have an identity and they're trying to, I guess, put out back [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=0.0s)]
*  calls for people that are in the podcast space. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=6.76s)]
*  They're trying to find their next Joe Rogan. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=10.84s)]
*  But of course, Joe Rogan used to be a part of the Democratic Party and they ran him away. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  This is what the New York Times is saying in this quote, the quiet effort amounts to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=19.6s)]
*  audacious skeptics might say desperate, but that Democrats can buy more cultural relevance [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=24.24s)]
*  online despite the fact that casually right leaning touchstones like Mr. Rogan's podcast [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=30.04s)]
*  were not built by political donors and did not rise overnight, Lisa. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, there's a group aiming to raise 45 million over the next four years in part on this effort. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=40.36s)]
*  But you know, I love, I think it was Elon Musk who tweeted out previously that like [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=45.64s)]
*  I didn't leave the Democrat Party, the Democrat Party, you know, and he tweeted out this meme [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  of the Democrat Party just going further and further left. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=53.2s)]
*  And he's like, I've always been here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=55.56s)]
*  They just left me to your point. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=57.28s)]
*  But I think the fact that they're trying to find the Joe Rogan is why they're never going [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=58.88s)]
*  to find it because he started his thing in 2009. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  He was just being authentic. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=65.4s)]
*  He was just being himself. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=66.4s)]
*  He wasn't trying to be anything. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=67.48s)]
*  And so if you go out intentionally trying to be something, people are going to see that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=69.04s)]
*  as inauthentic. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=72.16s)]
*  And that's also why President Trump won is because he is so authentic. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=73.16s)]
*  I think there's it's a little bit deeper, a little bit more layered onion than people [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=76.84s)]
*  want to think. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=80.84s)]
*  It's not just that all deep is this onion. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=81.88000000000001s)]
*  It's pretty deep. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=84.12s)]
*  And if you're like, I just take a big bite out of it anyway. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=85.12s)]
*  So it's not that all these people like Joe Rogan didn't become conservative. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  R.F.K. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Jr. didn't become a Republican. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard didn't come or become a Republican. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=96.2s)]
*  Trump's populism is almost completely aside from the Republican Party. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=99.72s)]
*  So when we talk about the Democrats looking for a message and trying to find how to connect [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=104.28s)]
*  with people, their message is anti Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=108.36s)]
*  That's what their message is. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  We stand for this. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  It's that he stands for that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  So we're going to stand against it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  When Trump goes and he does things like Republicans are traditionally big business friendly, not [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=115.08s)]
*  because they want to see big businesses rule the world, but because a country that is anti [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=120.16s)]
*  communist has companies in it that can become powerful. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  Think of meta. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=128.12s)]
*  That's not a pro Republican thing. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=129.12s)]
*  But the idea that a private company can have power is a conservative thing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=130.88s)]
*  Trump says, hold on, wait just a minute. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=135.2s)]
*  Should social media companies have this much power? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=137.12s)]
*  Should pharmaceutical companies have this much power? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  Should any company be able to dictate to us what we pay for equipment like tanks and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=141.4s)]
*  planes? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=146.12s)]
*  Do we just throw money at it or are we going to take a second look at it? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=147.12s)]
*  So Trump has made conservatism populist and there's no going back for the Republican Party [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=149.68s)]
*  or the Democrat Party. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  Joe Rogan is 10 times more liberal than I'll ever be. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  But yet here we sit today agreeing on more issues than not. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=160.08s)]
*  That's a bigger problem than the Democrats looking for the right face or voice for a [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  message that they don't even have. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=167.4s)]
*  I think the greater point is that podcasts weren't meant to be an operation for any political [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=169.0s)]
*  party. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=175.32s)]
*  It's supposed to be you develop an audience and then you shift them toward that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=176.32s)]
*  Joe Rogan said back in November though, they're missing the point because the Democratic Party [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=181.32s)]
*  left me. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  I didn't leave them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm sure they're scrambling to try to create their own version of this show. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  This is one thing that keeps coming up like we need our own Joe Rogan. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=195.2s)]
*  But they had me. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=199.2s)]
*  Well, number one they had me. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=200.2s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=203.28s)]
*  I think it cuts to the heart of the broader problem that the Democrat Party is facing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=204.28s)]
*  It's not the messenger, it's the message. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=208.32s)]
*  People just reject your ideas. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=211.16s)]
*  They reject who you are. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  They're a bunch of hall monitors now, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=214.04s)]
*  They're like the kid that's telling everyone, you know, like correcting everyone. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  You know, it's like, so it's not a messenger problem, it's a message. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=219.6s)]
*  It's what they stand for. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=223.56s)]
*  They're not relatable at all. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=224.92s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiJmP-ToVQg&t=226.32s)]
