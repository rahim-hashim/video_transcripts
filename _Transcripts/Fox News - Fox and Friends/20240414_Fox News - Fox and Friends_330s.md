# Israel has a ‘couple of hours’ to make a plan against Iran: ‘We are ready’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A)
*  Most terrifying part of it is explaining to your kids that they're going to be shot at again [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=0.0s)]
*  We have four kids all under the age of 15 and the prospect of spending yet another night in the bomb shelter was not [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=4.28s)]
*  Anything that we were looking forward to a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=11.06s)]
*  Fox News alert Israeli citizens on edge after Iran launched hundreds of hundreds of drones and missiles in its first direct military assault [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=13.9s)]
*  Meanwhile Israeli airspace back open schools and large gatherings remain canceled [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=23.04s)]
*  Former Israeli ambassador to the UN Danny Danon is a member of Israel's Knesset. He joins us now from Tel Aviv with an update Danny [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=28.36s)]
*  Thanks for being here. If you would first give us a sense of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=35.72s)]
*  The mood of the Israeli people there on the ground [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=39.6s)]
*  Coming out of this attack. What's the feel? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=43.88s)]
*  Good morning, you know indeed we had a very long night many Israelis [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=48.08s)]
*  Stayed awake to watch the interception to get the reports [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  And today we woke up we blessed we blessed the Lord [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=56.6s)]
*  We blessed the Israeli Air Force our allies who stood with us because it was almost a miracle [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=60.28s)]
*  Imagine you had 300 a rockets UAV missiles flying into our direction and we were able to intercept [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=65.96s)]
*  99% of them that's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=73.88s)]
*  Amazing but at the same time we are still on I alert because we realize that we have to retaliate [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=75.92s)]
*  In our neighborhood you cannot sit idly by after such aggression coming from the Tehran [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=82.08s)]
*  It will bring more attacks against Israel [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  So I think in the next few hours we will have to decide how when and where we [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=90.76s)]
*  Punch back against the question of Iran [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=97.0s)]
*  Danny you're very well connected inside leadership circles in Israel [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  So when you say something like we will attack just so you're saying it's a matter of when not a matter of if and and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=104.44s)]
*  you because [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=111.68s)]
*  Iran said through a statement of the UN hey, this is done. We're done and we're gonna hear that even from the US administration [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=113.48s)]
*  We want this to be done. Your sense is you can't tolerate a new status quo like this [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=118.76s)]
*  Well, we live in a different neighborhood [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  We are not in the US or Canada and in our neighborhood if you don't punch back [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=127.56s)]
*  It's irresponsible and I think the leadership in Israel is aware of that but it will be irresponsible [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=132.72s)]
*  Responsible not to retaliate because it would create a new equation in the Middle East that Iran will actually dictate [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=138.44s)]
*  When they would start an attack when they will end their attack not only against Israel against the other moderate country in the region [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=146.28s)]
*  so for the future of our kids for the future of Israel we have to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=153.88s)]
*  Punish Iran for what they did they crossed a red line. It never happened before [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  We use boxes they spend billions of dollars on the boxes [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=164.76s)]
*  But for the first time they chose to send those rockets and missiles from Iran [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=168.44s)]
*  we cannot [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=175.28s)]
*  move on after such an attack [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=176.84s)]
*  Danny did is it your sense that Israel or the United States was given a heads up that this attack was gonna happen [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=180.72s)]
*  There was so much reporting that there would be an attack from Iran. Everyone was sort of waiting for it [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  Do you have a sense of how much of a heads up there was did Iran really want the missiles to get through just? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=192.24s)]
*  Israelis defenses were that good give us a sense of how much chess is being played here versus how much of it is is [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=199.2s)]
*  Iran wanting to kill Israelis [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=206.28s)]
*  Well, you know they announced few days ahead of the attack that they will send rockets and missiles from Iran to Israel [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=210.0s)]
*  And they stress the point that it will not be through proxy that it will be from Iran [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=217.44s)]
*  We took it very seriously [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=222.16s)]
*  We were ready for that and that's why the yesterday were what we saw was a beyond imagination [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=223.76s)]
*  You know, I was up there all night [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=229.88s)]
*  You can look at the skies of Tel Aviv or Jerusalem and you would see the interception [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=231.32s)]
*  We even protected the the mask of el-Aqsa in Jerusalem [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=236.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, there were few people wounded a young girl a bedouin girl [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  She's still in critical condition and we pray for a recovery [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=244.56s)]
*  But overall, you know, it was an amazing show of our defense system and it's a sign for Iman [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=248.67999999999998s)]
*  We are ready. We are ready to protect ourselves, but we are also ready to attack. They should know that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  Danny real quick. How does this affect the war in in Gaza? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=261.64s)]
*  Because there are reports that Hamas has rejected Israel's latest ceasefire response sticking to their demands. He's still hostages there [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=264.96s)]
*  How does it affect that war? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=272.4s)]
*  Well, unfortunately [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=275.12s)]
*  We have seen that Hamas is not willing to engage despite the offers that were brought to the table and I see the connection [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=276.35999999999996s)]
*  I see the connection between Hamas and Iran [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=283.23999999999995s)]
*  You know, you see the radical rhetoric you see the the behavior of Sinwar and the leaders of Tehran [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=285.44s)]
*  And you realize that those radicals they don't care about achieving results. They care about [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=291.34s)]
*  Destroying the Jewish people. That's why we take it very seriously [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=297.44s)]
*  You know history have taught us to take it seriously when you have a regime or a leadership that is threatening the Jews [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=300.84s)]
*  We should not take it not seriously [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=307.84s)]
*  No doubt. Well, Danny Dinan, we're thankful that you and your family are safe after a long night [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo5SHjGLw9A&t=311.36s)]
