# Trump SHREDS Harris: She's an 'economic wrecking ball'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38)
*  And today you have Donald Trump. He is going to be in Savannah, Georgia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=0.0s)]
*  He had that big rally last night in Pennsylvania and he was talking about Kamala Harris's policies or how [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=3.72s)]
*  Lack thereof there aren't many details on her policies [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=10.56s)]
*  He went he went into detail about how he's gonna help you as an American what he'll do for you if he's elected again [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=13.56s)]
*  Listen to this [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=19.04s)]
*  Kamala Harris is reportedly given a speech in Pittsburgh, you know her speeches are very short [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  About her plan to quote build wealth. She doesn't know anything about building wealth [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=30.04s)]
*  But she's been in office for three and a half years [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=35.16s)]
*  Kamala's ruinous economic policies have already cost the typical household [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=38.88s)]
*  $29,000 through rampant inflation [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=45.76s)]
*  29,000 per household [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  She's a one-woman economic wrecking ball we will have no tax on tips [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=53.04s)]
*  We will have no tax on overtime. We will have no tax on social security benefits [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=60.0s)]
*  It's no wonder that Kamala Harris was just officially endorsed by IRS agents [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=69.36s)]
*  That's when you'd say I'd rather not have that endorsement [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=76.48s)]
*  And you know the thing about when Donald Trump talks people think back to four years ago and things were cheaper [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  And in fact, you know as a Kamala Harris does her pitching and she's gonna be apparently give some sort of an economic preview of what [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  Her plan last one went so well. Yeah, because it you know, everything is just broad [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=94.32s)]
*  I'm gonna have an opportunity [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=99.24s)]
*  We don't know what that stuff means [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=101.24s)]
*  But when you look at the facts and we've got them up on the on the big screen right now [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=102.8s)]
*  We all know that stuff costs more prices have increased close to 20% [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=106.74s)]
*  Since the beginning of the Biden-Harris administration and as Dave and Ted go over to the big screen [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=111.92s)]
*  Real wages and benefits have fallen 3% inflation [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=118.56s)]
*  Not making money [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=121.48s)]
*  Inflation has outpaced wages for 25 straight months [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=122.44s)]
*  We feel that look at that credit card debt is at over a trillion dollars because we don't have enough money in our bank accounts [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  So we've got to charge things on the credit cards and then when it comes to the bank accounts [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=132.72s)]
*  Currently people are saving at a much lower rate [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=137.32s)]
*  Because you can't save if you gotta buy bread and meat and milk [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=141.0s)]
*  Instead you have a choice. Am I gonna save money or am I gonna feed my family? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=147.48s)]
*  Of course, the family always wins [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=151.61999999999998s)]
*  Well, Brian goes to the big question why they won't answer the question Ian Sam's couldn't answer the question [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=153.32s)]
*  Kamala Harris can answer the question on the debate stage [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=158.27999999999997s)]
*  Are you better off now than you were four years ago? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  And the answer is clearly no people can't pay for anything the wages when you look at the way [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=164.64s)]
*  There's no real wage growth the prices have increased on the day to day and then everything that you're spending right now [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=169.48s)]
*  You're putting it on a credit card because you just can't afford it [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=175.44s)]
*  And instead of taking some responsibility for pumping all this money into the market [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=178.84s)]
*  They say that the small businesses are responsible because they are the ones that are price [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=183.38s)]
*  gouging [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=189.28s)]
*  So couple of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=190.28s)]
*  So a couple of things that it's going on if Trump loses his tax cuts go away [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=192.32s)]
*  That's going to affect everybody and just so you know, they're not tax cuts for billionaires [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=198.24s)]
*  The group that benefited the most stats don't lie is the middle class. They got a 16% pay increase. They got an extra [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=202.16s)]
*  $5,200 in their bank accounts every year if you look at the results of the tax reform [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=210.0s)]
*  There's only 1% off the higher class [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=214.32s)]
*  It was not a cut for billionaires that and it's important not to spin that because he's a billionaire [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=216.6s)]
*  It doesn't mean he did it for billionaires what he is going to do and present today something new [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=221.76s)]
*  He's gonna try to get manufacturing back [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  He's gonna say 15% corporate tax if you come back if you don't I'm gonna tear it's big [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=229.32s)]
*  I'm gonna tear up your companies if you don't come back [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=234.52s)]
*  100% yes [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=236.84s)]
*  Yeah [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=237.68s)]
*  He is tired of waiting for people just to say corporate tax went from 35 to 21 [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=238.0s)]
*  He says those companies are coming back are not gonna sit in Ireland and benefit they're gonna come back home no offense to the Irish [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=243.52s)]
*  I know some Irish they seem very nice like nice people [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=250.24s)]
*  Or Mexico because yesterday was talking about John Deere's thinking about moving to Mexico if John Deere moves to Mexico [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=252.72s)]
*  He did he said they want to bring this stuff back. I'm gonna put 200% [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vFVbKxr38&t=258.24s)]
