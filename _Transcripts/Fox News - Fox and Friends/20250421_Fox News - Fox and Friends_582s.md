# White House responds to Secretary Hegseth's new group chat allegations
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI)
*  Timothy Cardinal Dolan in New York, reacting to the death of Pope Francis just moments ago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=0.0s)]
*  But we also offer gratitude to God for the gift, the gift that he was. We don't call it Holy Father from nothing. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=6.0s)]
*  He's the father of our family, and there's a death in the family, and we're saddened. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=16.0s)]
*  So it was interesting too, because he was on our couch on Friday talking about the Pope. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=22.0s)]
*  This is leaders from around the world share their sadness over the loss. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=27.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, as we look at almost every world leader that I could think of has weighed in this morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=31.0s)]
*  And think about JD Vance. He was there yesterday, and there you see in this video, on Sunday, Easter Sunday. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=38.0s)]
*  And people talked about, well, it was a five-minute meeting. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=44.0s)]
*  Then you realize how he could have been suffering at that moment just for, because of the problems he's had breathing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=46.0s)]
*  And of course, he had passed away early, early this morning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=53.0s)]
*  Now let's bring in White House Press Secretary, Caroline Levitt. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=58.0s)]
*  Caroline, great to see you. Your thoughts that might have been relayed to you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=61.0s)]
*  Do you have any chance to talk to the Vice President about his last meeting with the Pope? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=66.0s)]
*  I spoke to the Vice President's team this morning, and they expressed how excited and grateful they were for the opportunity to have met with the Pope just yesterday. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=71.0s)]
*  And of course, we know the Pope has gone to be with the Lord this morning. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=82.0s)]
*  And I spoke to the President about that as well. And he has put out a statement to say, God bless the Pope and all those who loved him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=86.0s)]
*  He touched millions of lives throughout his tenure as the head of the Catholic Church. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=92.0s)]
*  And so it's a solemn day for Catholics around the world. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=97.0s)]
*  And we are praying for all those who loved the Pope and believed in him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=101.0s)]
*  Caroline, absolutely. And we were shocked to find out in the morning. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=105.0s)]
*  And obviously we changed the format significantly for this Titanic news event. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=108.0s)]
*  But the one thing that is happening is, Easter Monday traditionally is an Easter egg roll at the White House. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=112.0s)]
*  This is, Melania is going to be there. It's always great to see the First Lady. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=118.0s)]
*  Some members of the Cabinet are going to be there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=122.0s)]
*  I don't think you're going to need a giant man dressed in a rabbit outfit to direct the President on where to walk. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=125.0s)]
*  That will be a little different from past years. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=131.0s)]
*  But also, I think it's significant. You can have a corporate feeling to this in a way, correct? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=134.0s)]
*  Corporations are taking part in this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=139.0s)]
*  Well, that's actually always been the case, Brian. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=142.0s)]
*  It's just that the legacy media has picked up on it now because it's the Trump White House and they criticize everything we do. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=144.0s)]
*  This is going to be a traditional Easter egg roll. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=150.0s)]
*  The First Lady has overseen the careful coordination of this event alongside the United States Secret Service and the National Park Service as well. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=153.0s)]
*  And the President and First Lady will be welcoming thousands of people to the White House South Lawn today to roll the eggs, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=161.0s)]
*  but also to partake in many other celebrations and festivities. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=167.0s)]
*  So it's a joyous day for families who are traveling from all around the country to celebrate Easter Monday with the President and the First Lady. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=171.0s)]
*  And you'll be hearing from both of them later this afternoon. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=179.0s)]
*  All right. I'd actually take it as a negative. I think corporations are helping out. A children's event, I think it's a positive. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=181.0s)]
*  But Caroline, let's talk about what's happening with this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=187.0s)]
*  Kilmar Garcia, he is over in El Salvador. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=190.0s)]
*  And evidently, the senator did every Sunday show Van Hollen did every Sunday show to make sure everyone knows that he is OK. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=194.0s)]
*  Watch who did pay for this trip. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=202.0s)]
*  This was an officially cleared congressional trip clear tax payer basis. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=207.0s)]
*  Yes, like every other trip that like the trip, Christy Noem took with her fashion show before CICOT, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=212.0s)]
*  like the trip that five Republican members of the House took like the day before when they went into CICOT. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=219.0s)]
*  I can tell you so that that's yes, it was an official trip. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=226.0s)]
*  Right. He's that was an official trip. I don't know if any more will follow. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=231.0s)]
*  What do you think people should know about the person that Senator Van Hollen visited? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=234.0s)]
*  They should know the truth about this man. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=241.0s)]
*  He is an illegal alien, a foreign terrorist and a criminal and this 13 gang member who violated our country's laws by coming here in the first place. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=243.0s)]
*  And shame on Senator Chris Van Hollen and the entire Democrat Party who wasted Easter Sunday [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=255.0s)]
*  going on every television show in the country to advocate for the return of an illegal criminal gang member. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=262.0s)]
*  There is a litany of evidence proving this individual's ties to MS-13 that has been confirmed in two different courts. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=270.0s)]
*  There have been multiple law enforcement officers who have affirmed his MS-13 gang affiliation, and this is who the Democrat Party is advocating for. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=278.0s)]
*  It is ridiculous. The president, this White House, the entire administration will continue to focus on deporting these illegal alien gang members [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=287.0s)]
*  and criminals from our nation's interior and enforcing our country's immigration laws. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=296.0s)]
*  That's what the president was reelected to do. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=301.0s)]
*  And I would add that the overwhelming majority of Americans continue to support the deportation of illegal criminals. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=304.0s)]
*  A recent CBS poll showed that 89 percent of the American people support deporting illegal criminals from our homeland. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=310.0s)]
*  So the president will continue to do that while Democrats continue to trip over themselves, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=318.0s)]
*  while ignoring American citizens whose lives have been forever impacted by the actions and the crimes of these illegal criminals [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=323.0s)]
*  like Patty Moran, who we were so honored to have at the White House to share her daughter's story just last week. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=331.0s)]
*  Senator Van Hollen has never called her, has never reached out to her family, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=337.0s)]
*  yet he has spent hours now fawning over this illegal alien who is tied to a vicious gang that has taken the lives of American citizens. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=341.0s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=350.0s)]
*  I was disappointed that no one even broke out the field interview with the gang unit that interviewed him out when he was arrested originally, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=351.0s)]
*  was taken into custody. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=359.0s)]
*  They said he had the tattoos. He's wearing the Chicago Bulls hat. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=360.0s)]
*  They had an informant who they still trust said that he even had a ranking within MS-13. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=363.0s)]
*  They never talked about the trafficking case that for some reason no luggage going from Texas to Maryland. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=368.0s)]
*  We don't know what he was doing for a living to allow and sustain living there. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=375.0s)]
*  Senator Kennedy did come out and say, yeah, this guy looks like a really bad guy, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=379.0s)]
*  but the administration made a mistake sending him to El Salvador. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=383.0s)]
*  Do you feel that way? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=386.0s)]
*  We did not make a mistake. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=388.0s)]
*  We have always maintained that this was an individual who needed to be deported from our country. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=390.0s)]
*  The president swore to the American public he was going to deport illegal criminals, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=395.0s)]
*  and especially those who have been involved in violent gangs like MS-13 that have terrorized American communities. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=400.0s)]
*  And so to the Democrat Party who thinks that they are going to bring this foreign terrorist back to the United States of America [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=407.0s)]
*  to live a peaceful and happy life, that is never going to happen. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=413.0s)]
*  Not only is this an MS-13 gang member, but he is also an illegal alien who broke our nation's laws to come here. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=417.0s)]
*  And not only is it a slap in the face to the American citizens whose lives who have been put in danger [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=423.0s)]
*  or in many cases lost at the hands of these illegal alien criminal gang members, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=428.0s)]
*  but it's also a slap in the face to the millions of legal immigrants who came to our country the right way, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=433.0s)]
*  waited their turn, and paid their dues. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=438.0s)]
*  We have a legal immigration system for a reason. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=440.0s)]
*  The president is going to continue to uphold that. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=443.0s)]
*  It's very hard for me to play devil's advocate with this story because I feel passionate that he does not belong here, but I do try. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=446.0s)]
*  I want to end with this. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=453.0s)]
*  From Page of the New York Times, Secretary of Defense Pete Exith, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=455.0s)]
*  back of the news about staffers had to be dismissed and a second signal chat that took place. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=458.0s)]
*  Where does the president stand on this? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=464.0s)]
*  The president stands strongly behind Secretary Hegseth, who is doing a phenomenal job leading the Pentagon. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=467.0s)]
*  And this is what happens when the entire Pentagon is working against you and working against the monumental change that you are trying to implement. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=473.0s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth was nominated for this position because he is standing up for the war fighter. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=481.0s)]
*  The men and women in uniform who are putting their lives on the line to protect our country and our homeland. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=486.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, there have been people at that building who don't like the change the secretary is trying to bring, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=492.0s)]
*  so they are leaking and they are lying to the mainstream media. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=499.0s)]
*  We've seen this game played before. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=502.0s)]
*  The secretary is doing a tremendous job and the president stands strongly behind him. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=504.0s)]
*  Carolyn, I also think it's important to bring up that this chat happened before confirmation, while confirmation was taking place. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=508.0s)]
*  And also it just is kind of curious for me. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=515.0s)]
*  They're not interested in what these people were leaking, which seems serious. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=518.0s)]
*  They're interested in the secretary of defense, who wasn't. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=522.0s)]
*  That's right. They are lying about the secretary of defense. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=526.0s)]
*  Let me reiterate, no classified information was shared in these chats. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=529.0s)]
*  But you do have leakers who are leaking classified information, which is a crime, I will add. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=535.0s)]
*  And so the administration and the president have taken a very strong stance against anyone who leaks, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=541.0s)]
*  especially sensitive and classified information that can put our troops and our war fighters at risk. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=547.0s)]
*  And you've seen the secretary has taken very strong action to rein in the leakers at the Pentagon, and he will continue to do so, I'm sure. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=553.0s)]
*  Right. Absolutely. Thanks so much, Carolyn. Great to see you today. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=560.0s)]
*  And I know how intense everything is, but try to have a good time at the Easter egg roll. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=563.0s)]
*  I appreciate you joining us. Okay. Thanks, Brian. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_g0XSSduI&t=569.0s)]
