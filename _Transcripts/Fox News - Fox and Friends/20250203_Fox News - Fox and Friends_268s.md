# Elon Musk reveals shocking DOGE discoveries
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok)
*  Meanwhile, President Trump's tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China go into effect tonight at midnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=0.0s)]
*  And Canada says it's ready to respond. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=5.7s)]
*  Canadian native and O'Leary Ventures chairman, Kevin O'Leary, joins us right now from Tokyo. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=7.82s)]
*  Kevin, good evening to you there. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=15.22s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=19.3s)]
*  Alright, so you have talked to Donald Trump about tariffs on Canada and Mexico and China. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=20.42s)]
*  What did you tell him? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=27.900000000000002s)]
*  I was speaking specifically to him the last time I was in Mar-a-Lago about delaying the decision on Canada [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=30.6s)]
*  until they had finished their election. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=36.8s)]
*  As you know, the Canadian government has fallen. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=38.8s)]
*  There is no love lost between Trudeau and Freeland and Donald Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=41.3s)]
*  They had a bad relationship in his first mandate. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=46.1s)]
*  It's obviously gotten worse. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=50.1s)]
*  Trudeau's been calling him all weekend. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=51.5s)]
*  Calls not returned. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=53.6s)]
*  This is not good. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=54.6s)]
*  They're supposed to speak today. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=56.5s)]
*  I would prefer, and many Canadians feel the same way, and many investors, I mean really I'm an investor, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=58.3s)]
*  would rather have the new government in place to negotiate the new deal, but that's not what happened. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=63.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=68.0s)]
*  Kevin, Donald Trump ran on lowering costs for food and energy and stuff like that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=70.0s)]
*  Right now, the conventional wisdom is if they go into effect, 25% Canada and Mexico, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=75.8s)]
*  Americans are going to get hurt a little bit. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=84.3s)]
*  I look at this at the beginning of a negotiation, and I've always said to everybody on both sides [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=88.9s)]
*  because I'm kind of in a unique situation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=94.3s)]
*  You know, I'm a Canadian, but my entire family is American, so it's a... [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=96.9s)]
*  and I invest on both sides of the border. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=101.9s)]
*  In chaos, there's opportunity. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=104.5s)]
*  The biggest thing going on here is a negotiation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=106.5s)]
*  We know it's about fentanyl right now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=109.8s)]
*  You had Doug Bergamon just moments ago saying exactly that, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=111.5s)]
*  but the real opportunity comes out of the chaos and economic union. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=114.8s)]
*  I think this is the beginning of that narrative. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=118.6s)]
*  I will note that energy is only at 10%, and I think the reason that's the case, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=120.7s)]
*  or at least part of it is, that Danielle Smith, the Premier of Alberta, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=126.9s)]
*  took the time to go meet Trump in Mar-a-Lago a few weeks ago and plead her case [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=131.0s)]
*  about the importance of the relationship on energy to the U.S., [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=136.2s)]
*  and here she is getting a benefit from it at 10% opposed to 25%. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=139.2s)]
*  And you know, that's good. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  Bergamon's now the energy czar. He understands the importance of Canada. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  You've got to remember, Alberta has more energy the entire United States. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=148.89999999999998s)]
*  That's where there's opportunity. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  That's where the economic union makes sense to investors. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=154.89999999999998s)]
*  Speaking of opportunity, Elon Musk and the Doge team are looking at [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=157.7s)]
*  how much money the federal government spends, and he posted this on X. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  The Doge team discovered, among other things, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=167.5s)]
*  that the payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=169.9s)]
*  to approve payments even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=174.8s)]
*  They literally never denied a payment in their entire careers, not even once. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=178.6s)]
*  What do you make of Elon Musk going through Washington right now with a Hoover? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=184.5s)]
*  I'm okay with it, and I think the American people are okay with it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  Everybody knows the dirty little secret about government. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=195.4s)]
*  It drips with fat. No one's ever done an exercise like this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=198.6s)]
*  I thought he'd get a lot more pushback from Congress, and he's not. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=202.29999999999998s)]
*  He's going in there with a spatula, and he's scraping out billions of dollars, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=206.6s)]
*  and people are okay with it. After all, it's taxpayers' money. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=211.1s)]
*  Why not do this? If you sit around your kitchen table, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=214.5s)]
*  you've got to have a budget every year. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=216.9s)]
*  Why can't we apply the same kind of philosophy to government? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=218.6s)]
*  And that's why he's getting a lot of latitude and a lot of slack, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=222.7s)]
*  even though he's a controversial guy. But look at the executional skills he has. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=226.8s)]
*  There's nobody like him. Let him do his thing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=230.10000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Wonderful, you are in Tokyo making a movie with who? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  Gwyneth Paltrow and Timothee Chalamet. The kid is up for us on the Dylan film. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=240.0s)]
*  Look, they just changed my script. I mean, I'm going out of my mind here. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=245.10000000000002s)]
*  I've got to get all this memorized. I've got to memorize all this tonight. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=248.3s)]
*  And it is night there in Tokyo. Kevin, thank you very much. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  Take care. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E16UpzXY2ok&t=257.5s)]
