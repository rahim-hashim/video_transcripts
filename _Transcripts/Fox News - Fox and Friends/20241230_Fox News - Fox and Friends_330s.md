# Debate over H-1B visas is an example of how politics should work, columnist argues
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU)
*  President-elect Trump is backing Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy after a fiery debate online in the MAGA community on H-1B visas for foreign workers, saying, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=0.0s)]
*  quote, I've always liked the visas. I've always been in favor of the visas. That's why I have them. We have them. I have many H-1B visas on my properties. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=8.48s)]
*  I've been a believer in H-1B. I've used it many times. It's a great program. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=16.56s)]
*  Our next guest writes that this disagreement we're seeing in the GOP camp, well, it's okay. It's how politics should work. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=20.6s)]
*  Author of the op-ed David Marcus joins us now. Good morning, David. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=29.0s)]
*  You know, I think you're right. I think you're I think you're unassailably right. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=34.4s)]
*  But it was contentious there for a while. Maybe still is. But it was contentious on the right over this debate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=38.68s)]
*  Got a little zesty, a little bit like a Cowboys-Eagles game. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Right. So here's David. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=50.6s)]
*  Eagles fan coming in, taking his swipe this morning. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=54.2s)]
*  What? Forty one seven. We're going to set that aside and deal with the less contentious debate here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=56.6s)]
*  That's H-1B visas. Sounds good. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=60.84s)]
*  Look, I think both Ramoswamy and Musk got out a little over their skis. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=63.32s)]
*  The vakes, weird diatribe about American kids having too many sleepovers really, you know, kind of went over like a ton of bricks. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=68.16s)]
*  And then Musk was saying, I wish I had twice as many foreign workers. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=74.4s)]
*  And you had a lot of America first Trump supporters saying, hey, buddy, you know, read the room. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=77.68s)]
*  And where we landed is and President Trump sees this is with really legitimate competing interests here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=82.08000000000001s)]
*  Yes, we absolutely want to attract the best and the brightest of the United States. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=88.84s)]
*  We also want to make sure that that kid who graduates with a degree in architecture isn't facing unfair foreign competition. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=93.0s)]
*  That's not only going to undercut him in terms of wages, but an H-1B visa holder, you lose your job, you get deported. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=99.12s)]
*  That's an awful lot of leverage that you're handing over to owners. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=105.68s)]
*  So, again, legitimate competing interests and a good debate has come out of it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=108.52s)]
*  Well, and I want to go in just in just a moment, I want to go back to the real healthy side of this. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=113.6s)]
*  But the the point you're also making this debate has legitimacy both on a deep philosophical level and on a surface policy level, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=119.16s)]
*  meaning we should be talking about H-1B visas and how they're being abused and the problems in that system. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=126.24s)]
*  And hopefully, President Trump, I think he does based upon his first term, sees that and might go about correcting those problems in the policy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=131.32s)]
*  And then there's the philosophical stuff. Hey, America first. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=138.12s)]
*  Shouldn't you be prioritizing the interest of Americans? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=141.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=145.4s)]
*  And, you know, this is the United States of America and you can be the richest man in the world. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  It's not going to protect you from blowback when American citizens feel like, you know, you're not putting them first. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=151.84s)]
*  And look, I think Musk has walked some of this back. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  He now says that he thinks that it should be very expensive to hire an H-1B visa applicant. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=162.44s)]
*  And I think that's absolutely right. And that speaks to really, you know, the point that he was making was, you know, he says he's talking about like NBA stars. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=169.16s)]
*  I want the Albert Einstein's and that's fine. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=177.12s)]
*  But that's a very different conversation than accountants and graphic designers and people who are holding jobs that American citizens need. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=180.88s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  And then if the American worker is told, hey, we need to import workers to pick crops, you're not going to do that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=189.8s)]
*  And oh, by the way, we also need these really highly skilled jobs to import. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=196.52s)]
*  What are you leaving the American worker with? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=199.28s)]
*  What are you telling the American worker they're good for if you need to bring people from across the world to do jobs on all ends of the spectrum? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=201.16000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. Sitting at home scrolling on your screen and ordering from Amazon, I presume. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's also part of the cultural question here that I think Ramaswamy kind of kicked the door down of, which is that, look, most Americans don't want to work 80 hours a week until they die to make, you know, big tech, more money. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=215.04s)]
*  That's not the American dream. And the American government doesn't exist to help billionaires make more money. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=230.96s)]
*  It exists to help everyday Americans live the way they want to live, not as cogs and some sheep. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  I really like that point, David, because there's more to a country and more to a person than your economic output. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  That is important. But there is way more to a nation than its GDP. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=250.0s)]
*  Last, because this is the crux of what you wrote about. This is good. This is all good. This is the way it's supposed to work. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  You're supposed to have these open conversations, debates. And after being accused of being acolytes at the altar of Trump or in a cult, the left is watching the right actually have a real, as we pointed out, policy and philosophical debate. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=261.0s)]
*  Yes. And they're terribly disappointed that this has not destroyed MAGA and made everybody hate each other. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=274.36s)]
*  I mean, look, you know, we can have these conversations. We can have these disagreements. We can all get smarter by doing it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=280.68s)]
*  And that's that's what America is. So God bless. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=289.32s)]
*  Listen, man, you don't have to wake up at 730, 740 angry, got a hold of your hairdryer, sitting in front of your modern art, telling me about the Eagles beating the Cowboys. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=293.2s)]
*  You don't kick a man when he's down. OK, you're 13 and three or something like that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=303.0s)]
*  I'm nobody right now, just America's team. So you don't have to do this. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=307.56s)]
*  Just win with grace. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=311.96s)]
*  Philly noted to win and lose with grace. Thank you, David. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkfdJrQPaUU&t=315.47999999999996s)]
