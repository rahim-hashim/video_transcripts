# Kamala Harris to unveil economic policy: 'Absolute socialism'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k)
*  Kamala Harris finally debuting her economic platform in a few hours. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=0.0s)]
*  It's got new tax credits, costly support, costly support for first time home [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=4.4s)]
*  buyers and a federal ban on quote price gouging. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=8.64s)]
*  Harris specifically calls out grocery stores taking advantage of Americans, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=12.4s)]
*  but look at this retailers reporting profit margins at 1.6%. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=15.6s)]
*  Really? Is that gouging? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Former Trump chairman of the council on economic advisors twice. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=21.8s)]
*  Kevin has to joins us. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=25.04s)]
*  Kevin, from what you see and for what's been framed out for us this morning, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=26.52s)]
*  what will this do? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=30.6s)]
*  Like for an economist, this is about the most terrifying proposal I've ever seen [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=33.44s)]
*  because what Kamala Harris is saying is that the government needs to set the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=37.44s)]
*  price of things and she's starting with food. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  But I guess if they're going to set the price of food, they might as well set [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  the price of everything else. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  They've also come out, you might recall the Biden administration saying that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  they want to set rents that they think rents are too high. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=50.16s)]
*  And so they're going to have the government decide what the rent for your [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=52.92s)]
*  apartment should be. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  This is absolute socialism and it never ends well. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=56.080000000000005s)]
*  If you go back and look at the countries that have tried this, like Cuba, Venezuela, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=60.040000000000006s)]
*  Ukraine, back when the Soviet Union organized it, then it leads to famine and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=64.2s)]
*  shortages. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=68.68s)]
*  And I was just in Lisbon, Portugal, where they still have really aggressive rent [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=69.48s)]
*  control and all of the apartments are empty because the people who own the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=73.44s)]
*  buildings can't afford to rent them to people because the rent is so low. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=76.60000000000001s)]
*  And so this is an absolute disaster. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  This is socialism at its highest. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=81.64s)]
*  And the really chilling thing is that think about it, it's right before the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  Democratic National Convention. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=86.4s)]
*  She's the nominee. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=87.56s)]
*  She should be trying to moderate her positions to appeal to swing voters. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=88.72s)]
*  And instead, she's going all in on socialism. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=93.16s)]
*  So what it means is these people really are that way. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=95.44s)]
*  These people really believe in socialism. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=97.88s)]
*  They want to change this country and they're willing to say it, you know, up [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=99.72s)]
*  front right now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  And it's astonishing to me that she would do that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  But, Kevin, here's how you could spin it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  Don't you care about first time home buyers? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=107.76s)]
*  Don't you care that people have health care debt? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=109.84s)]
*  Don't you care that students have people in the workplace have student loans? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=111.84s)]
*  And if you don't, you have no heart. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=116.08s)]
*  You don't care about people. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=117.52s)]
*  You only like rich people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=118.4s)]
*  That's the spin for people that want to push back on what she's presenting. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=119.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=125.92s)]
*  And the way to respond to that is to say that, geez, you know, if you create a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=126.24s)]
*  happy business environment, then people get jobs, they have high incomes and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=132.04s)]
*  they can afford stuff. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=135.16s)]
*  If you want people to have cheap places to live, then you should stop like [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=136.32s)]
*  the expansion or encourage the expansion of building into parts of the city [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=141.08s)]
*  that aren't zoned to have houses. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=147.0s)]
*  And then you increase the supply of houses. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  There are a lot of things that you could do that make economic sense that help [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=150.36s)]
*  these folks. And it's not just having the government set things. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=153.08s)]
*  Whenever the government set things and what happens is that if you're friends [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=156.08s)]
*  with Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, then they're going to be sure that the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  prices for your stuff are they're really good. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=163.24s)]
*  And if there's a shortage, you're going to get it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=164.96s)]
*  But if you're an ordinary folk, then you're going to go to the grocery store and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=166.52s)]
*  it's going to be kind of like the drugstore where you got to go find someone [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=169.6s)]
*  to get you the razor blades because they're behind lock and key. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=173.04s)]
*  There's going to be shortages and it's going to be hard to get stuff and the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=175.04s)]
*  shelves are going to be empty. Make no mistake, in socialist country, the shelves [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=178.08s)]
*  are empty in the stores. And that's the country that Kamala Harris wants to give [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=181.68s)]
*  us. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  You want a free market or you don't? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=185.12s)]
*  People need to explain that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=186.32s)]
*  When they asked Fox News, asked people, who do you trust in the economy? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=187.68s)]
*  It's still Trump, 52, 46, a little bit closer than it was under Joe Biden. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=191.08s)]
*  When also when she talks about, oh, I'm for fracking down for offshore drilling, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=195.08s)]
*  but there's a way to be subtly against it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=199.16s)]
*  And that's through regulations. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=201.12s)]
*  That's through maximizing federal land and not letting people drill on it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=202.68s)]
*  There's a subtle way to hurt the oil and gas industry while not saying I want to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=206.84s)]
*  ban on it, isn't there? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=211.32s)]
*  Right. Well, also, if you look at the way she said that, even that thing, it's so [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=214.24s)]
*  duplicitous because at first she wants to ban fracking, but then her campaign puts [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=217.76s)]
*  out a statement. You should go read it, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=221.8s)]
*  It says we're not opposed to all forms of fracking. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=223.56s)]
*  So there's probably some somewhere where you use unicorns and pixie dust and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=227.08s)]
*  they're fine with that. But fracking itself, you know, they're not. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=231.08s)]
*  But again, they didn't say we're fine with fracking. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=234.04s)]
*  They said we're not opposed to all forms of fracking. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=236.04s)]
*  And they didn't say what forms they're not opposed to. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  So it means they're opposed to fracking. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=240.84s)]
*  People in Pennsylvania should know it's on a pause right now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=242.24s)]
*  All new leases before they vote and early voting should be in a couple of weeks. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=244.76s)]
*  Kevin Hassett, thanks so much. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=249.0s)]
*  To catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3J2gBH42k&t=256.84s)]
