# Trump adviser stresses the need to 'restore confidence' in basic levels of government
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo)
*  Senior advisor to President-elect Trump, Jason Miller, joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=0.0s)]
*  Jason, welcome and happy New Year. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=3.56s)]
*  So how have the tragic events of New Year's Eve affected maybe the calculus in the Senate [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=5.76s)]
*  for confirming especially these national security nominees? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=12.36s)]
*  Well, I think it heightens the importance of getting these picks confirmed ASAP, because [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=15.84s)]
*  not only do we have national security positions, we have law enforcement positions, whether [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=20.92s)]
*  that be attorney general or cash Patel for FBI, but also we have critical infrastructure [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=25.68s)]
*  as well. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=30.16s)]
*  Think about all the disasters that we've had on the transportation front in recent years [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=31.16s)]
*  during the Biden administration. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=35.18s)]
*  We need to not only put in President Trump's people so we can implement this change, but [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=37.0s)]
*  we need to restore confidence in our basic levels of government, where that's national [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=41.96s)]
*  security, law enforcement or critical infrastructure. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=45.72s)]
*  We cannot have any more lapses. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  President Trump has picked some fantastic people and the American people voted for him [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=51.08s)]
*  to put the adults back in charge. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  We need them on day one. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  One of the things that happened after this tragic event in New Orleans is a lot of people [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=58.72s)]
*  were like, I don't trust the FBI to be in charge of this investigation. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=62.36s)]
*  They've just lost confidence in them because they focused on DEI. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=66.2s)]
*  They focused on going after political opponents. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=69.52s)]
*  They've taken people off of important cases to get them onto the January 6th, you know, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=73.16s)]
*  grandmas. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=79.84s)]
*  So what can Cash Patel, how hard will it be if Cash Patel and as you said, Pam Bondi, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  get in? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  How hard will it be to change that culture? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  Because it seems like it's been inbreded. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=90.44s)]
*  Well, I have a lot of confidence that both Pam Bondi and Cash Patel will be able to bring [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=92.12s)]
*  about immediate change. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=96.28s)]
*  And that's because these are serious grownups who are going to come in and implement what [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=97.48s)]
*  President Trump said that we need to do. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=101.26s)]
*  Get the politics out of this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  There are so many good people who work, whether it be at the DOJ or the FBI, but the culture [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  at the top, the leadership, I think has been fundamentally broken. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=109.54s)]
*  And that's why you've seen this politicization of justice, all the ridiculous political attacks [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=112.66s)]
*  against President Trump over the past four years, but not even just President Trump. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=117.38s)]
*  Look what they've done, how they've changed the culture within this country. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=120.94s)]
*  We have a crisis in confidence when it comes to the leadership of our federal government [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  under the Biden administration. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=128.58s)]
*  This has been a terrible four years. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=130.26s)]
*  When we talk about the border, we talk about the law enforcement within the country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=131.86s)]
*  Another name that I would say that's going to be very important to get confirmed is Christy [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=135.7s)]
*  Noem for Homeland Security. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=138.76s)]
*  That's going to be a critical position. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=140.48s)]
*  But President Trump needs his people in right now. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=142.0s)]
*  We have to get them through committee and have them ready to go on day one. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=144.88s)]
*  So you're very close to the president. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=148.44s)]
*  I know the nominees are doing everything they can to get themselves ready for these [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=149.96s)]
*  confirmation hearings, but everything depends on these votes from senators. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=153.92s)]
*  What is the president doing? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=157.04s)]
*  I mean, you saw what he did this past week, you know, sort of twisting arms, making sure [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=158.48s)]
*  that his his person, Mike Johnson, gets the speakership and we don't have a devolved [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=163.0s)]
*  government over on the House side. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=168.7s)]
*  So what is he doing in this regard with with senators? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=170.98s)]
*  Is he personally calling them? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=175.17999999999998s)]
*  Is he twisting arms? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=176.5s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=177.78s)]
*  Well, the good news is, is since President Trump has picked such outstanding people, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=179.17999999999998s)]
*  many of them are going to sail through. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=182.98s)]
*  But it's not just sailing through. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=185.1s)]
*  We need them to move through very quickly. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  And with other folks, obviously, the nominees are going around to have their meetings on [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=188.42s)]
*  Capitol Hill with the various senators. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=192.66s)]
*  And then those committee hearings will be coming up very shortly. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=194.45999999999998s)]
*  But also, President Trump has picked up the phone and where he's need to make some calls. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  He's done that as well. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=200.94s)]
*  But all we've asked all along is once we get these nominees in front of the senators, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=202.17999999999998s)]
*  they're impressive. I mean, these are a very this is a very impressive group of folks who [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=206.94s)]
*  are going to be in these cabinet and director positions. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=211.54s)]
*  Once they get into those meetings, they win everybody over because they're so focused and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=213.98s)]
*  so serious about doing the job. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=218.5s)]
*  But there's urgency, a fierce urgency of now that we have to get them in place. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=220.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well, Donald Trump certainly has the mandate. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=225.54s)]
*  And I think there might be some political blowback for holding these these nominees up. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=227.57999999999998s)]
*  But these kinds of things happen. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  We'll see how it all plays out. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=234.38s)]
*  Jason Miller, thanks for thanks for giving us the state of play. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=236.18s)]
*  Appreciate it so much. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=239.34s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8n9BC1oSwo&t=240.5s)]
