# Rachel Campos-Duffy: Justin Trudeau understands he can't 'play games here'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04)
*  We also love this event from Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=0.0s)]
*  Justin Trudeau made his way down to meet with [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=2.68s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=5.08s)]
*  He also was at dinner table, you can see there, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=6.76s)]
*  with Howard Lucknett, the incoming Secretary of Commerce [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=8.28s)]
*  and his wife, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=11.84s)]
*  incoming lead of the Interior Department and his wife, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=14.6s)]
*  and Mike Waltz, Trump's choice to be [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=17.28s)]
*  National Security Advisor along with his wife. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  You can also see there the Senator-elect [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=21.36s)]
*  from Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=23.36s)]
*  Trudeau bought some of his cabinet as well [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=25.6s)]
*  to have this dinner. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=27.86s)]
*  Where they wanted to discuss the proposed tariffs [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=29.18s)]
*  Donald Trump has talked about with Canada and Mexico. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=32.46s)]
*  This sounds like a super fun dinner conversation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=34.82s)]
*  Well, let's look at those proposed tariffs [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=37.34s)]
*  that were discussed at that dinner. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=40.26s)]
*  25% on Canadian and Mexican goods, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=42.34s)]
*  10% on all Chinese goods, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=44.86s)]
*  41% of total trade to the US is from Mexico, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  China and Canada. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=51.78s)]
*  We're looking at a total of $3.1 trillion of goods [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=54.14s)]
*  that are imported totally. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=60.08s)]
*  That are imported totally. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=61.2s)]
*  You know, this is a big deal because we don't export [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=62.72s)]
*  as much to them as they send to us. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=65.88s)]
*  China specifically. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=69.12s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=70.16s)]
*  And so this is a big deal. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=71.08s)]
*  I mean, you know, Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=72.76s)]
*  ideologically oppose, and yet you see Justin Trudeau, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=76.76s)]
*  I'm gonna read you this quote, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  you're gonna see how conciliatory he is. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=81.92s)]
*  He's not messing around, he understands [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=84.34s)]
*  he can't play games here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  This will deeply affect Canada. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=87.53999999999999s)]
*  And so he, this is a quote from him earlier on Friday. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=89.7s)]
*  He says, ultimately it's through lots [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=92.97999999999999s)]
*  of real constructive conversations with President Trump [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=94.78s)]
*  that I'm going to have that will keep us moving forward [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  on the right track for all Canadians. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=99.94s)]
*  It's important to understand that Donald Trump, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=101.82s)]
*  when he makes statements like that, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  he plans on carrying them out. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=105.3s)]
*  There is no question about it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=106.78s)]
*  That could not have been written by Caroline Leavitt [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=110.1s)]
*  and been better for Trump. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=113.58s)]
*  That is absolutely what Trump wants people to hear and read. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=114.9s)]
*  And maybe it was coordinated. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=118.7s)]
*  I think he's genuine when he says that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=119.78s)]
*  But what he's saying is, hey, that strategy [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=121.94s)]
*  that President Trump campaigned on and told you would work, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=124.58s)]
*  it's working, it's working on me [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  as the Prime Minister of Canada. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=129.22s)]
*  There was a similar situation with Mexico last week. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  Now that president, she's come back and kind of, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=133.4s)]
*  she obviously got pushed back, I think, afterwards. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=136.18s)]
*  But the end statement was, we're gonna work with you here [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=138.66s)]
*  from both Canada and Mexico now. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=142.3s)]
*  And Trump's promise was that he probably wouldn't have [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=145.56s)]
*  to put these tariffs into effect. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=148.2s)]
*  That the threat of the tariffs [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=149.88s)]
*  and them knowing he'll follow through [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=151.24s)]
*  will get us the result we want. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=153.2s)]
*  And I wanna make sure Americans know, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=154.56s)]
*  the result we want is a secure border, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=155.84s)]
*  is fentanyl and bad people staying outside our country. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=158.56s)]
*  And I think that if our neighbors or our friends [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  like Biden wanted to say, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  then they should want that for us. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=167.68s)]
*  The border is one of the issues. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=168.8s)]
*  The other thing is Donald Trump actually believes [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=170.44s)]
*  this could be a good revenue stream. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=172.12s)]
*  He's talking about using the money from these tariffs [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=174.02s)]
*  to help pay for some of the tax cuts he wants to bring back, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=176.72s)]
*  but more importantly, to lower the deficit, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=179.68s)]
*  which you know we're at 35 trillion now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  He's saying within a year, we could maybe bring that back [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=184.68s)]
*  by over a trillion dollars. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, Stephen Moore, the co-founder [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=189.96s)]
*  of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  was on Fox and Friends earlier to talk about these tariffs. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  I think the outcome is here is gonna be positive [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=196.68s)]
*  for the United States and for Canada and Mexico. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  I mean, we all should join together. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=202.86s)]
*  The whole Reagan vision was that North America [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=204.78s)]
*  would be a large free trade zone. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, part of free trade cannot be allowing these chemicals [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  and these drugs into our country. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's so obvious. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=215.34s)]
*  So I think that what's gonna happen, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=217.54s)]
*  because look, Canada and Mexico have to trade [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=219.06s)]
*  with the United States. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=221.36s)]
*  We do have leverage over them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=222.2s)]
*  And I think in the end of the day, they will cooperate. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=223.9s)]
*  We will reduce the amount of these illegal drugs [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=226.98000000000002s)]
*  in the country, and every one of us will be better off. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=229.3s)]
*  So I'm positive about this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=231.74s)]
*  I think it's gonna be very favorable to the United States, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=233.82s)]
*  and we're gonna reduce this scourge [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=236.98s)]
*  of drug overdoses in our country. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=238.74s)]
*  You know, these particular tariffs, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=241.22s)]
*  these specifically to Canada and Mexico, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=243.42s)]
*  are designed to affect policy change, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=246.74s)]
*  and that policy change is a more secure border. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=248.74s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=251.14s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSeA1nHzs04&t=252.02s)]
