# Judge blocks deportation of Boulder suspect's family
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo)
*  The bolder terror suspect, Mohammed Salman, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=0.0s)]
*  is expected in federal court later today [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  on hate crime charges, adding to the 118 state charges [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=5.08s)]
*  against him for that horrific attack on pro-Israel rally. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=8.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, a Biden-appointed judge [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  is temporarily blocking the deportation of Salman's wife [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=14.72s)]
*  and five children, who sources say [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=17.44s)]
*  have all overstayed their visas. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=21.76s)]
*  Jay Towns, joins us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Jay, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=26.36s)]
*  Good morning, Lawrence. How are you? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=29.56s)]
*  Good morning, Ainsley. Brian, good morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=30.88s)]
*  We appreciate it, Jay. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  So I just want to get this statement in from their attorney. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=34.199999999999996s)]
*  I think it's a ridiculous statement. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=37.2s)]
*  This is what they're saying in the statement. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=39.6s)]
*  Punishing individuals for the purportive actions [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=41.8s)]
*  of their relatives is a feature of medieval justice system [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=44.48s)]
*  or police state dictatorships, not democracies. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  The Trump administration's vindictive attack [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=51.2s)]
*  on this young family echoes the methods of Nazi Germany, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=53.08s)]
*  where authorities use kin punishment [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=56.28s)]
*  to intimidate the population. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  One, why would he bring that up [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  when this guy was literally attacking the Jews? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=62.72s)]
*  And number two, it's not like the administration [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=66.2s)]
*  is holding this family responsible criminally, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  but they're saying they overstayed their visas. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=72.44s)]
*  They got to get out of the country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=74.88s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=76.04s)]
*  Yeah, once again, you have lawyers on the left [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=78.08s)]
*  and you have a judge in this case, Judge Gallagher, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=81.36s)]
*  who are substituting their judgment [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  in place of the entire executive branch [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=86.92s)]
*  to include the secretary of state and the president [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  in violation of Article II. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=91.4s)]
*  To invoke Hitler's Germany in an instance [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=94.0s)]
*  of anti-Semitic terrorist attack [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=97.92s)]
*  is really just sort of beyond credulity. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=101.16s)]
*  And when you read this judge's order, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=104.08s)]
*  Lawrence, there's just so much wrong with it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=108.88s)]
*  I've been a lawyer my entire adult life, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  and I can tell you that you always look [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=113.36s)]
*  for some semblance of legal premise, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=114.91999999999999s)]
*  even when you believe that the judge is incorrect. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=117.36s)]
*  And I can tell you that this order is devoid of any. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't have any personal juris- [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=123.08s)]
*  I'm sorry, Jay. Sure. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=125.08s)]
*  Give us an example of that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=126.08s)]
*  Yeah, so there's no personal jurisdiction over this family [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=128.4s)]
*  because they've been removed to Texas. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=131.68s)]
*  So they're not in Colorado. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=134.04s)]
*  We've gone through this with Judge Boasberg. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=135.32s)]
*  The subject matter jurisdiction has been stripped [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=138.84s)]
*  from Colorado because the Immigration [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=142.76s)]
*  and Naturalization Act says that you have to go [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=145.16s)]
*  through every process available before some sort [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=149.92s)]
*  of habeas petition can be filed. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=152.92s)]
*  This judge didn't base his TRO on any law, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=156.44s)]
*  just on sheer panic. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  And then what's most sort of obscure about this filing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=164.16s)]
*  is it's called a next friend petition, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=167.84s)]
*  where the mother and the kids [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=170.04s)]
*  or a guardian ad litem did not even file the petition. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=171.68s)]
*  It was just someone that knew them, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  who had no idea what processes were being afforded, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  this wife and these kids. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=180.52s)]
*  And the judge just bought off on it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  And so it really is, we're seeing it across the country [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=185.0s)]
*  in DC and in Massachusetts and other places [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  where these judges so want to stop the efforts [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=191.84s)]
*  of the Trump administration and substitute their judgment [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=195.28s)]
*  in place of Article II powers. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=199.36s)]
*  It really isn't a front to our justice system altogether. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  Jay, that was actually some interesting information. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  I didn't realize that the family didn't even file [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=205.6s)]
*  that petition themselves. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=208.04s)]
*  It was someone else that did it for them. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=209.56s)]
*  I want to get your reaction on another story. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=211.64s)]
*  So Harvard is filing a legal challenge over Trump's ban [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=213.84s)]
*  on the US entry for incoming foreign students. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  How do you think this is going to play out in court? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=219.28s)]
*  The executive does have some discretion [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=222.0s)]
*  when it comes to visas. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  How is this challenge going to work? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, this is just in a long line of sort of a back and forth [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  between the Trump administration and Harvard. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=238.2s)]
*  You'll recall, Lawrence, that the Trump administration [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=240.12s)]
*  halted billions in funding to Harvard. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=243.92s)]
*  And now they're saying, well, we're not going to let [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=247.92s)]
*  foreign students go to Harvard because of the types [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=249.68s)]
*  of activities that you're allowing these individuals [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  to engage in. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=255.32s)]
*  So President Trump is not going to fund those activities [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  and then staff them with foreign students [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=260.96s)]
*  that have bad intentions. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=263.88s)]
*  And so 27% of Harvard's student body are foreign students. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=265.28s)]
*  They all pay full tuition. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=269.76s)]
*  This is how Harvard meets its overhead, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=271.08s)]
*  because it gives so many scholarships [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=272.88s)]
*  to the other students that are from the United States. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  And again, Trump is invoking, and Secretary Rubio [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=279.84s)]
*  are invoking, national security concerns. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=284.64s)]
*  That is the apex of Article II powers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=288.12s)]
*  And so for Harvard to invoke the First Amendment [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=291.68s)]
*  or just some sort of right on behalf [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=295.12s)]
*  of international students to come here as guests, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=297.52s)]
*  that is never going to trump the national security concerns [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=301.16s)]
*  espoused by this administration. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=304.76s)]
*  Now, I will predict that the district court judge [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=307.76s)]
*  in Massachusetts is going to side with Harvard, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=310.2s)]
*  but eventually at a circuit court [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=312.76s)]
*  or at the Supreme Court level, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=314.56s)]
*  it's all going to come back to reality [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=316.12s)]
*  that national security concerns [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=317.76s)]
*  are in the hands of the president. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=320.12s)]
*  As it always has been until Donald Trump became president [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=322.08s)]
*  and then suddenly these judges went crazy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=325.35999999999996s)]
*  Jay Towns, excellent legal analysis today. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=327.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  Thanks, Lawrence. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOjSYF3UIo&t=333.12s)]
