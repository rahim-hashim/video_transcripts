# Netanyahu responds to Biden's 'red line' remark, hot mic comment
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8)
*  Fox News, President Biden calling on Prime Minister Netanyahu as Israel defends itself [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=0.0s)]
*  from Hamas terrorists who murdered more than 1,200 Israelis and still hold more than 100 [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=4.4s)]
*  hostages. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=10.4s)]
*  What is your red line with Prime Minister Netanyahu? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=11.8s)]
*  For instance, would invasion of Ra'a, would you have urged him not to do? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=15.8s)]
*  There's a red line, but I'm never going to leave Israel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=20.0s)]
*  The defense of Israel is still critical. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=23.0s)]
*  So there's no red line. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=25.0s)]
*  I'm going to cut off all weapons so they don't have the Iron Dome to protect them. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=26.64s)]
*  There's other ways to deal, to get to, to deal with the trauma caused by Hamas. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  But the red line is Ra'a. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=38.24s)]
*  Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joins us live from Jerusalem. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=40.24s)]
*  We don't have to give you the news. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=43.24s)]
*  You follow American news as if you're still here, Prime Minister, Prime Minister. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=45.24s)]
*  His red line is Ra'a. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=49.24s)]
*  Don't go into Ra'a. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=50.24s)]
*  What's your response? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=52.24s)]
*  Look, the president and I have agreed that we have to destroy Hamas. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=53.24s)]
*  We can't leave a quarter of the Hamas terror army in place there, there in Ra'a. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=59.54s)]
*  This would be equivalent to saying, you know, after the allies fought back, gone through [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=66.14s)]
*  Normandy, went through Germany, and you'd say, well, we'll leave a quarter of the Nazi [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=71.64s)]
*  army in place and we won't go into Berlin, the last stronghold. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=76.9s)]
*  So I think that if the president means by that that we should first enable the safe [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=80.62s)]
*  departure of the civilian population from Rafah before we go in, we agree with that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  We don't need any prompting. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=91.7s)]
*  That's not what he said. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=92.7s)]
*  If he means let's make sure that they are... [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=93.7s)]
*  But that's not what he said. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=94.7s)]
*  He doesn't want you to go in. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=95.7s)]
*  Well, you know, I think you have to ask him what he said because he agrees, he said that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=96.7s)]
*  he agrees that we have to destroy Hamas as a fighting organization. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=100.26s)]
*  That's what we intend to do. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=104.38000000000001s)]
*  Look, it's either Israel or Hamas. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=105.62s)]
*  There's no middle way. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=107.38000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we have to have that victory. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=108.38s)]
*  We can't have three quarters of a victory. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=110.86s)]
*  We can't have two thirds of a victory because Hamas will reconstitute itself with these [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  four battalions in Rafah, reconquer the Gaza Strip and do the October 7th massacre over [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=118.06s)]
*  and over and over again. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=123.84s)]
*  And for us in Israel, not merely for me, but for the people of Israel, that's a red line. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=125.38s)]
*  We can't let Hamas survive. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=130.74s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, we don't want to put you in a difficult position because, you know, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=132.62s)]
*  we know that you have to work with the U.S. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=136.5s)]
*  I know we're still strong allies, but there's been multiple comments, whether it was a red [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=138.17999999999998s)]
*  line from the president of the United States or Kamala Harris saying that we need a ceasefire [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=142.61999999999998s)]
*  now. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=147.89999999999998s)]
*  I know there's been conversations in the press about a fractured relationship. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  Can you tell us about what's going on between you and the president? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=153.73999999999998s)]
*  Because right now, what I'm hearing from the IDF and some of my friends that are going [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=156.54s)]
*  out there to battle Hamas is that they don't have the support truly of the United States [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=160.11999999999998s)]
*  right now and that you guys have been pressured to come off the gas a little bit. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=165.9s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=170.18s)]
*  Look, we have our agreements on the basic goals, but we also have disagreements on how [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=173.18s)]
*  to achieve them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=177.86s)]
*  Ultimately, it's Israel that has to decide. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=178.86s)]
*  Our neck is on the line. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=181.38000000000002s)]
*  Are they encouraging you to get off the gas though, Prime Minister? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=182.38000000000002s)]
*  Our women are ready to be headed. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=185.38000000000002s)]
*  Well, I'm telling you that we're not getting off the gas. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=186.38000000000002s)]
*  I'm telling you that we have to take care of Israel's security and our future, and that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=189.66000000000003s)]
*  requires eliminating the terrorist army. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  That's a prerequisite for victory. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=196.14s)]
*  That victory is important not only for us, it's important for the civilized world as [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=198.29999999999998s)]
*  we're fighting these barbarians. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=202.34s)]
*  And let me tell you something. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=203.34s)]
*  I've seen these recent polls where 82 percent of Americans support Israel in its battle [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=205.73999999999998s)]
*  against Hamas. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=211.14s)]
*  82 percent. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=212.14s)]
*  That's been constant over the last five months. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=213.14s)]
*  So they recognize that our battle is your battle and our victory is your victory. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=215.48s)]
*  And I'm sure that deep down, everyone in Washington understands that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=220.8s)]
*  And that's what we're going to do. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=224.08s)]
*  We're going to defeat Hamas. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=225.08s)]
*  We're going to do what is necessary to minimize civilian casualties, do the humanitarian aid, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=226.08s)]
*  something that we believe in. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=232.0s)]
*  But we have to destroy this terrorist Nazi army. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=233.0s)]
*  Otherwise, there's no future for anyone in the Middle East. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=237.52s)]
*  I think everyone, Mr. Prime Minister, is trying to figure out what is meant by President Biden, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  how that defines your relationship. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=245.96s)]
*  We're trying to figure out what it means by a red line, what it means by what Lawrence [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=248.2s)]
*  is articulating and what it means when President Biden says something like this on a hot microphone [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=253.48s)]
*  at the State of the Union. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=258.36s)]
*  Let's listen together. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=259.47999999999996s)]
*  We've got to keep pushing. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=261.24s)]
*  We're going to do it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=263.24s)]
*  I'm the humanitarian stuff. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=264.24s)]
*  I told you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=265.24s)]
*  Maybe someone can say something. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=269.24s)]
*  Just... [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=273.24s)]
*  So what does that mean to you, a Come to Jesus meeting? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=274.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=281.24s)]
*  I'm not familiar with the term, even though Jesus wasn't born that far away from here. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=283.24s)]
*  I can tell you that if it means having a heart-to-heart conversation, we've had that plenty of times [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=287.64s)]
*  over the 40 years that I've known Joe Biden and over the 12 or 13 conversations that we've [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=293.44s)]
*  had since the beginning of the war. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=300.24s)]
*  But ultimately, I'm the Prime Minister of Israel. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=302.24s)]
*  I'm responsible for the security and future of the Jewish state. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=304.64s)]
*  And I'm supported in my policies. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=308.36s)]
*  That's important to understand. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=310.64s)]
*  The overwhelming majority of Israelis support my policies, that we have to eradicate Hamas [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=312.44s)]
*  as a terrorist and governing organization, that we have to get our hostages back, and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=317.92s)]
*  that we have to make sure that Gaza doesn't form a threat to us anymore. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=322.88s)]
*  99 to 9 Knesset members, that's over 90%, supported my policy of opposing a Palestinian [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  state being rammed down Israel's throat. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=336.64s)]
*  That's what we had the other day. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=338.64s)]
*  When people say, well, we have to have this talk with Netanyahu because he's holding back [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=340.48s)]
*  the prospect of this wondrous peace with a Palestinian state, you don't have an issue [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=345.92s)]
*  with me. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=349.88s)]
*  You have an issue with the entire people of Israel. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=350.88s)]
*  They're really united as never before, and united to destroy Hamas and ensure that we [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=353.56s)]
*  don't have another Palestinian terrorist state like the one they had in Gaza that could threaten [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=359.68s)]
*  the state of Israel. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=364.8s)]
*  That's something that the people of Israel are united behind. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=366.2s)]
*  And for what I can see, most Americans support that as well. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=368.96s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Biden's been around a long time. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=372.32s)]
*  It's easy to surmise, at least here in the American press, he knew he was on a hot mic [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=376.79999999999995s)]
*  in that moment. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=380.4s)]
*  It was after the State of the Union after all. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=381.4s)]
*  I'm wondering what that does to negotiations, that that message was communicated to you [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=383.32s)]
*  via the press instead of in the privacy of diplomatic channels. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=388.08s)]
*  What does that do to the ceasefire negotiations? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=391.84s)]
*  What does that do to the more than 100 hostages being held, including one-year-old Kofir [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=394.08s)]
*  Bevis, that sweet little baby, in Hamas hands? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=398.92s)]
*  Well, look, to the extent that the world thinks that America and Israel are united, that helps [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=402.6s)]
*  the war effort and it helps our effort to achieve victory and obviously the release [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=409.12s)]
*  of the hostages. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  To the extent that Hamas believes that there's daylight between us, that doesn't help. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  I appreciated the support that President Biden and the administration have given us since [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=419.92s)]
*  the beginning of the war. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=426.0s)]
*  I can only hope that it will continue to victory because victory is at hand. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=427.08s)]
*  Victory is close. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=432.84s)]
*  I mean, we've destroyed, as I said, three-quarters of those fighting battalions. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=433.84s)]
*  We're very close to victory. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=437.84s)]
*  The best thing we can do for the future of the Middle East, for the future of peace, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=439.24s)]
*  for the future of those hostages is get a speedy victory. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=443.72s)]
*  And the victory will come as soon as, I think will come sooner, the more united we are and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=446.88s)]
*  not divided or at least not given the appearance of division. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=453.2s)]
*  Well, I know what you're saying, but with Kayleigh's point, I did hear that you guys [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=457.47999999999996s)]
*  had virtually something agreed to with Hamas. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=461.8s)]
*  And as soon as they see the fracture with the U.S., they said, we can hold out for a [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  better deal since they're getting all this pressure. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=468.36s)]
*  And that blew up the deal on the hostage for prisoner swap. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=471.18s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure that that's exactly what happened. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=475.88s)]
*  I think Hamas from the start has demanded just outlandish demands that were nowhere [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=480.72s)]
*  in the ballpark. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=486.52000000000004s)]
*  So they weren't there in the first place. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  But again, I repeat it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=489.68s)]
*  We're not fighting just our battle. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  We're fighting the battle of civilization against barbarism. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=493.66s)]
*  We're fighting the battle against the Iran terror axis, which goes against America. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=497.6s)]
*  They say that you are the great Satan and we're the small Satan standing in their way. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=502.0s)]
*  These are the people who are your worst enemies, our common worst enemies. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=506.64000000000004s)]
*  And at this point, the entire international community, at least the civilized community, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=510.36s)]
*  should stand behind Israel, reject the vilifications and the pressures that are brought against [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=515.24s)]
*  Israel that is fighting this just war against these barbarians. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=520.6800000000001s)]
*  That's what I think is required to do. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=524.44s)]
*  Most Americans understand it, and I hope that that's what will also be perceived in the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=526.7s)]
*  Middle East because it'll help us get the job done sooner. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=531.16s)]
*  We're going to win this war. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=534.12s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, and I hope you guys do win the war, but there's a lot of concern, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=537.3199999999999s)]
*  not just with the UN, but we got a little jihadis running around here in the United [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=542.3199999999999s)]
*  States. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=545.78s)]
*  You got people putting pressure on the president of the United States. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=546.78s)]
*  I plan on going to Israel next month to be with you guys before the Holy Week, but are [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=549.7199999999999s)]
*  you concerned about the anti-Semitism here in America and across the globe? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=554.5999999999999s)]
*  You went to school here. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=560.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=561.9599999999999s)]
*  Of course I'm concerned. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=564.5200000000001s)]
*  Who would not be? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=566.6s)]
*  I mean, and I don't think you have to be, it's not only the Jewish people who should [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=567.6s)]
*  be concerned. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=571.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, anti-Semitism is the canary in the coal mine because once you begin with this [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=572.1600000000001s)]
*  anti-Jewish hatred, you know that that erupts into broader violence and disrupts entire [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=578.2800000000001s)]
*  societies. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=583.36s)]
*  I think that this is a real badge of shame for those who are supporting Hamas. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=584.36s)]
*  They're supporting these mass murderers, these rapists, these baby-burners, and they're [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=590.4s)]
*  supporting it against the one democracy that is fighting them with tremendous odds against [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=596.1999999999999s)]
*  a terrorist enemy that implants itself in civilian quarters, that uses civilians as [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=601.36s)]
*  human shields, that uses terror undergrounds as no army has faced. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=606.88s)]
*  General Petraeus was here recently. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=610.64s)]
*  He said, listen, no army is facing what Israel has faced. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=612.16s)]
*  Colonel John Spencer, the head of urban warfare at West Point, says no army has gone to the [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=616.04s)]
*  lengths that Israel has gone to avoid civilian casualties. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=620.32s)]
*  So Israel is fighting this just war against the most unjust of enemies. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=623.48s)]
*  And these people are protesting in the streets supporting these mass murderers, these modern [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=628.12s)]
*  Nazis. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=633.12s)]
*  That's a shame. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=634.12s)]
*  That's, you know, it's disgraceful. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=635.12s)]
*  It's as though you were fighting in World War II and you had people demonstrating in [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=636.12s)]
*  the streets of New York and Washington in support of the Nazis. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=640.44s)]
*  That's basically what you have here. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=644.5200000000001s)]
*  So I think the majority of Americans have it clear. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=646.0s)]
*  Their moral compass is clear. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=649.08s)]
*  They understand that Israel is fighting this battle of civilization. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=650.92s)]
*  They also understand that we're going to undo less to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=654.6s)]
*  They also understand that the future of the Middle East, the future of many Muslims, the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=659.36s)]
*  future of Gazans is dependent on our victory. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=663.96s)]
*  And we don't intend to give up. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=666.86s)]
*  We're going to achieve this victory, I hope, with the solid support of the American government [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=668.2s)]
*  up to now. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=673.84s)]
*  And I hope it continues. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=675.2s)]
*  But one way or the other, we're going to do it. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=676.2s)]
*  You got to finish the, you got to go for the win or else we're going to be back here in [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1wiQw9bL8&t=678.0400000000001s)]
