# Riley Gaines blasts shocking ruling in favor of trans athletes
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU)
*  This morning, the fight for fairness in women's sports as judges in Arizona and New Hampshire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=0.0s)]
*  rule in favor of biological males pushing to play on female sports teams. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=5.32s)]
*  Our next guest has been calling out the unfairness since being forced to compete against trans [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=10.32s)]
*  swimmers in college. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=14.16s)]
*  Host of Gaines for Girls podcast on nowkick.com, Raleigh Gaines joins us now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=16.32s)]
*  Riley, good morning to you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=21.04s)]
*  Two legal victories here on the trans athlete side of the equation here. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=23.8s)]
*  The Ninth Circuit in Arizona allows trans athletes and also this court in New Hampshire [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=29.56s)]
*  is going to allow trans athletes for the time being and to continue to compete against girls. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=36.14s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=42.0s)]
*  This is pretty heartbreaking news is what it is to see courts to see judges ruling in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=43.0s)]
*  favor of males. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=48.68s)]
*  I mean, women's sports were created on the explicit grounds of being exclusive. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=50.8s)]
*  And so when we allow males, regardless of how they identify to compete in women's sports, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=55.12s)]
*  it undermines everything that women's sports were created to protect and to uphold and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=61.04s)]
*  to celebrate. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=66.16s)]
*  I believe these judges, of course, one is an Obama appointee, the judge in Arizona. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=67.44s)]
*  I mean, really, they're acting more like the activists. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=72.0s)]
*  If you look at their statements, they released what they are doing is ruling not only in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=74.44s)]
*  opposition to women, but really in opposition to biological reality. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=79.4s)]
*  Riley, you're out there with this issue, obviously, at the forefront of this issue. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=83.72s)]
*  And as you pointed out, these are judges and judges don't necessarily have their finger [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=87.56s)]
*  on the pulse of society. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=91.28s)]
*  Do you feel like I guess it can feel like, wow, this is a movement who is moving forward, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=93.36s)]
*  like it's gaining ground. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=98.44s)]
*  But what I guess if we set aside the legal system again, which doesn't necessarily reflect [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=100.0s)]
*  public sentiment, where do you think the public is moving on this? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=106.6s)]
*  The public is 110 percent on our side. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=111.32s)]
*  I mean, look at it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=115.32s)]
*  That's why this issue isn't brought up in the same way that it was two years ago on [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=116.32s)]
*  public forums. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=120.0s)]
*  That's why they didn't talk about this issue at the debate earlier this week. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  It's because the Democratic Party knows that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=124.61999999999999s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=127.24s)]
*  Kamala Harris, a Tim Walz ticket, they know that this is not a winning issue, that this [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=128.24s)]
*  issue does not pull in their favor. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=132.24s)]
*  And so they desperately want to run from it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  They do not want to attest to their voting records. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=137.24s)]
*  They do not want to publicly say that they stand against women, that women are not worthy [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=139.72s)]
*  of calling ourselves champions, because that is the message that they're sending. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=144.68s)]
*  That's the message that I've received loud and clear. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=148.68s)]
*  And again, that's what you can expect from a Kamala Harris, Tim Walz ticket. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=151.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris was voted the most progressive senator, I believe, in 2018. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=154.96s)]
*  And so a Harris-Walz ticket would be a Joe Biden presidential candidacy on steroids is [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=160.86s)]
*  what it would be, Will. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=167.86s)]
*  Riley has a new special up at Fox Nation. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=169.02s)]
*  It's called Transfixed. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=172.3s)]
*  Let's take a quick look at Transfixed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=173.3s)]
*  She looked into my eyes and said, you're a boy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=177.78s)]
*  This makes sense. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=180.5s)]
*  It's why you want to die and you're miserable and everything will go away when your brain [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=182.38000000000002s)]
*  and your body are aligned. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  Riley, tell us about that clip. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=189.46s)]
*  That's you interviewing, I assume, someone who's begun the process of transition or has [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=191.26000000000002s)]
*  transitioned. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=195.46s)]
*  And tell us about the show at large. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=196.86s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  In that clip, you see me interviewing a young girl who was coerced at a young age to transitioning. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=201.42000000000002s)]
*  She got involved in these online communities and was manipulated into believing that she [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=207.66000000000003s)]
*  was a boy, began to transition, but ultimately realized one day she still had that maternal [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=212.06s)]
*  instinct. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=217.74s)]
*  She one day wanted to be a mother, but it was unfortunately almost too late at that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=218.74s)]
*  point as doctors had removed healthy body parts, her breasts. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=222.66s)]
*  She began to de-transition. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=226.82s)]
*  Then ultimately she did get pregnant and she gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=228.82s)]
*  But again, she doesn't have breast to breastfeed, but they don't remove the mammary gland. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=233.01999999999998s)]
*  She's still producing milk. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=237.46s)]
*  I mean, really, really tragic, horrible, heartbreaking things. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=238.7s)]
*  But these are the things that the American people, the American voters, your common sense [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=242.7s)]
*  American who intuitively knows that males and females are different. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=249.42s)]
*  These are the kind of stories that they need to hear and that they need to see to understand [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=253.54s)]
*  this isn't a solution in search of a problem. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=258.06s)]
*  This is happening all around us. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=259.97999999999996s)]
*  And they can by watching Trans Fixed on Fox Nation, Riley's News special. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=261.58s)]
*  Thank you, Riley. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NizC-Ch_7AU&t=266.14s)]
