# Israeli dossier alleges nearly 200 UN staffers have ties to Hamas
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE)
*  So you have this Israeli dossier. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's now out, able for all of you to read. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=2.6s)]
*  It's alleging that 190 U.N. employees have ties with Hamas or Islamic Jihad operatives, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=4.84s)]
*  including 12 who they claim were involved in Hamas terrorist attack on October 7th. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=11.0s)]
*  Their alleged crimes include kidnapping an Israeli woman, raiding a kibbutz, and providing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=16.28s)]
*  ammunition to Hamas fighters, two thankfully, maybe three, are actually dead. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  Here to discuss is Oklahoma Senator and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mark [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=25.88s)]
*  Wayne Mowen. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=29.8s)]
*  So Senator, this is a group in charge of getting aid into Gaza because the IDF is on the march [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=30.8s)]
*  looking for Hamas. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=37.04s)]
*  What does this do to our money, to our continuing donations to this organization? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=38.28s)]
*  We should stop it immediately. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=43.96s)]
*  The IDF had been telling us from October 7th that the U.N. employees were involved in this. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=44.96s)]
*  They said we have proof that vehicles and assets were being used by Hamas. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  We didn't want to hear it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=54.86s)]
*  And I mean that as a whole. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=55.86s)]
*  We didn't want to hear it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=56.96s)]
*  You know, proof's in the pudding. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=57.96s)]
*  The IDF said we'll show it to you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  We continue to show. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=60.28s)]
*  And that number that you said, over 119 or whatever the number is, it's actually 49% [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=61.28s)]
*  of the U.N. employees that was working inside of Gaza had direct ties to Hamas. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=66.08s)]
*  Direct ties. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  That is very alarming. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=72.52s)]
*  So when we were having aid going in, I was saying this the whole time, the aid was being [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=74.36s)]
*  auctioned off by Hamas. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=79.6s)]
*  When we were taking aid in for the Gaza citizens, they were actually taking it and selling it [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=81.28s)]
*  to the citizens that they're trying to care about. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=87.76s)]
*  And at the same time, we were actually funding the war. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=91.16s)]
*  So our aid was funding their fight. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=93.5s)]
*  And right now, there's a big push to say, hey, like Norway came out and said, hey, U.S., [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=96.4s)]
*  I understand you're angry and there's other nations that join the U.S., but this is the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=101.8s)]
*  only way to get aid to these people. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=107.28s)]
*  They're funding the fight. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=108.28s)]
*  They are selling the product that's going in. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=109.78s)]
*  There's a systemic issue going on with U.N. inside of Gaza. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=112.52s)]
*  These individuals, they don't care about the citizens. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=117.48s)]
*  They only care about killing Israelis. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=120.52s)]
*  Hands down, that's it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=123.96s)]
*  So if we can't control the money and they're using it to fund the war, then we should have [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=125.3s)]
*  stopped the flow of it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=129.32s)]
*  So Trump stopped it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=130.84s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=131.84s)]
*  He stopped it in the third year and fourth year of his administration. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=132.84s)]
*  So obviously, there was some intelligence out there to let him to do that because you [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=135.64s)]
*  don't really pick up this intelligence when you're working a business or hosting the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=138.88s)]
*  apprentice. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=142.04s)]
*  So they knew about this before the October 7th attack. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=143.04s)]
*  I don't think we knew as far as it was going, but we knew there was a problem and we have [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=145.72s)]
*  known that for quite some time. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=150.48s)]
*  So we also know there's more death and it's the U.S. again. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  Ironically, the odds were this was going to happen when you have over 160 attacks and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=155.32s)]
*  a handful of reprisals. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  Now we find out that three of our Americans are dead. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=162.72s)]
*  Dozens more are wounded after this drone attack over in Jordan. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=167.68s)]
*  The president promises a response. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=171.32s)]
*  He's looking at his options. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=173.28s)]
*  Are you briefed on this? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=175.12s)]
*  What went wrong and what do you think the response should be? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=176.76s)]
*  We haven't got a classified briefing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  We got phone calls on it immediately. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  This happened in Tire 22, which is on the border between Jordan and Syria. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=181.92s)]
*  Sarah, well, you know, Syria. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=185.56s)]
*  Syria. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=188.16s)]
*  It happened in Tire 22 right on the border in Jordan. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=189.16s)]
*  These were a reserve unit that was watching it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=192.44s)]
*  We knew that the drone was coming in. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  We thought it was a U.S. drone. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=197.32s)]
*  We misidentified it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=199.32s)]
*  Obviously, we have now three dead over 30 injured. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=200.72s)]
*  The issue is a response. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  Since we knew that it was it was coming in, we also know where it went. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=206.84s)]
*  The response should be immediate. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=210.2s)]
*  The problem is, is we have a weak leader in the White House. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=211.6s)]
*  This wouldn't happen if Trump would have been put in because we would immediately respond [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  and they would have known it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=217.04s)]
*  But when you try to appease the Iranians, which isn't going to happen, they only believe [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=218.18s)]
*  in peace through strength, not appeasement, then you have an issue. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=224.0s)]
*  And we have 153 attacks that we haven't responded to. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=227.28s)]
*  We've only responded to a handful. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=230.08s)]
*  They're going to continue to fuel this fight. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=232.04s)]
*  And now they went too far by killing Americans and attacking our base directly. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=234.36s)]
*  So we should have already responded. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=239.32s)]
*  But this administration is not geared up for that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=242.12s)]
*  So right now, nobody wants a war in the Middle East. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=244.44s)]
*  But the enemy has a vote. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=246.44s)]
*  And what Mike Pompeo said yesterday is we might not want a war with Iran, but they're [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=248.16s)]
*  at war with us. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=251.94s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=252.94s)]
*  Mike's 100 percent right. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=253.94s)]
*  But we don't have to go to war with them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=255.6s)]
*  If we are being more aggressive and step up, they believe in strength and they will [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=257.16s)]
*  cower down. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=261.32000000000005s)]
*  They do not want to fight the United States. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=262.32000000000005s)]
*  They're not looking for a fight. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=264.16s)]
*  If they wanted a fight, they would do it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=266.04s)]
*  But they're funding terrorist organizations, Brian. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=267.76000000000005s)]
*  If they wanted a fight, they would use their army, not these terrorist organizations, not [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=269.88000000000005s)]
*  these proxy wars. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=273.36s)]
*  They're not looking for this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=275.08000000000004s)]
*  They're just trying to disrupt. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  It's propaganda for them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  It's the way to say, hey, listen, look at us. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  We're going after the Great Snake, which they consider the United States that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=281.92s)]
*  And you can't simply go after the Houthis. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=285.24s)]
*  You can't go after Hamas. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=287.0s)]
*  You can't go over these terrorist organizations. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=288.16s)]
*  If you're going to take out the snake, you need to go after the head of it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=290.4s)]
*  And the head is Iran. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=292.88s)]
*  As you know, real quick, Senator Lankford is working, been working very hard and diligently. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=293.92s)]
*  And I think it's so wrong to attack him personally if you don't like this border bill. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=297.76s)]
*  He's a great job. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=301.48s)]
*  Everybody knows it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=302.48s)]
*  So he's working with Murphy and Sinema to get something done. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=303.68s)]
*  They brief you regularly. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=306.2s)]
*  Your job is to go tell the House how it's going. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=307.8s)]
*  You think there's anything about this bill that has a future in the Republican House? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=310.76s)]
*  It's going to be tough. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=315.08s)]
*  Before Speaker Johnson can bring it to the floor, he has to have the majority of the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=317.0s)]
*  majority. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=320.23999999999995s)]
*  And right now, I don't believe he has the majority of the majority to even bring the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=321.23999999999995s)]
*  bill to the floor. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=323.96s)]
*  Even in this sad because decisions have been made and the bill hasn't been released. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=325.52s)]
*  You don't even how can you say you don't like something if you haven't read it? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpO2D7QO3KE&t=330.59999999999997s)]
