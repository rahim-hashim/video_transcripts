# Karoline Leavitt sends message to Dems planning to disrupt Trump address
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI)
*  Americans can expect Donald Trump to say many things that are false, including perhaps Russian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=0.0s)]
*  information. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=9.28s)]
*  What we will not hear from Donald Trump, however, is the truth. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=11.08s)]
*  We know that he's going to lie, that he's going to be completely divorced from reality [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=14.88s)]
*  in terms of what he describes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=19.56s)]
*  That State of the Union speech is going to be a farce. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=21.8s)]
*  I think it's going to be a MAGA pep rally. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=23.8s)]
*  We can make sure the American people understand that this man is not keeping the promises [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=26.06s)]
*  that have a real impact in their lives. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=36.06s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=39.06s)]
*  We always take our cues from them. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  Ilan Omar, tonight, President Trump said to address a joint session of Congress and Democrats [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=42.379999999999995s)]
*  are plotting their resistance with plans to disrupt it, I guess. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=46.86s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt joins us right now in studio. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=50.739999999999995s)]
*  Caroline, first off, your first mini State of the Union speech to the joint session of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=54.14s)]
*  Congress. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  What's the mindset of the staff and the president? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=59.660000000000004s)]
*  We're so excited. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=62.18s)]
*  It's a big day and it's a big night for President Trump. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=63.18s)]
*  And we know he's going to give a fantastic speech. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=66.22s)]
*  The theme is the renewal of the American dream. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  And the renewal of the American dream is underway already. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=71.94s)]
*  Look at all that President Trump has accomplished in his first month as president. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=74.62s)]
*  He's going to highlight some of those accomplishments. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=79.32s)]
*  He's also going to talk about his plans to fix the economic mess that was created and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=82.06s)]
*  left for him by Joe Biden in his administration. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=85.98s)]
*  He's going to dive into foreign policy, talk about his intention to end the war in Ukraine, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=89.34s)]
*  talk about his plan to bring all of the hostages out of Gaza home. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=94.12s)]
*  And he's also going to make an ask of Congress tonight. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=97.78s)]
*  We need more border funding to continue with these deportations that have been incredibly [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=100.12s)]
*  successful because of the efforts of this administration, but we need more resources. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=104.68s)]
*  Is there any support from the bills that they're working on in the House and Senate? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=109.22s)]
*  Look, the president has been engaged in those negotiations, as you know, with both members [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=112.22s)]
*  of the House and also on the Senate side too. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=115.74000000000001s)]
*  He's expressed his intention is one big, beautiful bill, but he wants to get the deal done. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=118.34s)]
*  And you will hear him talk about how border patrol and DHS need more funding. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=125.5s)]
*  We need to deport the tens of millions of illegal criminals who the previous administration [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=130.22s)]
*  led into our country. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=134.98000000000002s)]
*  The administration is doing everything they can and those deportation efforts are underway, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=136.44s)]
*  but certainly we need more resources and we need more men and women who want to join this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=140.26s)]
*  historic effort. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=144.66s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=145.66s)]
*  So also you have recruiting up. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=146.66s)]
*  We get those numbers in December and January. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=148.38s)]
*  That's got to be encouraging. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=150.92s)]
*  But tonight at the speech itself, there's going to be some special guests, some of which [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=152.26s)]
*  you can reveal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=155.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=156.82s)]
*  Looks like the first lady will have a big roster, including Stephanie Diller. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=157.82s)]
*  And that is one of the themes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  Also law enforcement who lost their, whose spouses lost their lives in the line of duty. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=164.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=168.88s)]
*  The first lady will be in attendance tonight and the guest list that she put together and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=169.88s)]
*  President Trump put together is phenomenal. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=173.45999999999998s)]
*  There will be everyday American heroes in attendance. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=175.56s)]
*  Stephanie Diller, whom you mentioned, who lost her husband in the line of duty at the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=178.6s)]
*  hands of an illegal immigrant. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=182.28s)]
*  You have Mark Fogel, who of course, because of President Trump's peace through strength [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=183.68s)]
*  efforts, returned from Russian captivity. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  who lost his life protecting his family in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=191.84s)]
*  You'll also have an auto worker. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=195.4s)]
*  You'll have a steel worker and you will see exceptional Americans with great stories. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=197.04s)]
*  President Trump will be telling their story. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=201.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  I know you mentioned Elon Musk will be there. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=205.32s)]
*  The advisor will be there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=206.32s)]
*  The secretaries will be there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=207.32s)]
*  You also mentioned there's special guests and you gave me the idea that perhaps you [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=208.32s)]
*  might weaken and tell me who the surprise guests are. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=213.56s)]
*  Have you decided if you're going to tell me? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=217.16s)]
*  I have decided. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=219.32s)]
*  I am not going to tell you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=220.32s)]
*  I will let President Trump tell the country later. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=221.6s)]
*  But there are going to be some very special guests that the president will reveal in his [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=224.32s)]
*  speech. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=228.56s)]
*  And I also want to mention there will be the mothers of Jocelyn Nungare and Lakin Riley, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=229.56s)]
*  who will be in attendance tonight, who of course lost their daughters at the hands of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=233.92s)]
*  illegal migrant immigrants. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=237.4s)]
*  And that's what part of the reason President Trump is working so hard on these deportations [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=239.24s)]
*  and why Congress and Democrats need to get on board with this effort because the vast [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=243.44s)]
*  majority of Americans are supportive of it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=247.6s)]
*  The border is almost virtually shut down. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=250.0s)]
*  No one expected this type of success even better than the first time. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=252.08s)]
*  So now, yesterday the president announced a pause in Ukraine aid. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=255.6s)]
*  Could a call from President Zelensky today change that? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=260.44s)]
*  Well, that's up to President Trump to decide. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=263.64s)]
*  What I do know is that President Trump wants to make a deal. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=266.38s)]
*  And unfortunately, it has appeared thus far that President Zelensky is unwilling to talk [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=269.2s)]
*  about a real peace agreement. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=274.0s)]
*  And in order to negotiate peace, you've got to bring both sides to the table. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=276.72s)]
*  And in any good deal, in business, in politics, usually both sides leave a little bit unhappy. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=279.92s)]
*  And I think President Zelensky unfortunately is failing to realize that at this moment [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=284.6s)]
*  in time. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=288.04s)]
*  But look, the president is a dealmaker and that's what he wants to do. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=289.04s)]
*  He wants this war to end. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=292.04s)]
*  He wants to stop the killing. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=293.48s)]
*  He wants to see a ceasefire. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=294.88s)]
*  And he had an economic agreement on the table, on a silver platter for President Zelensky [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  to sign at the White House last Friday, which wouldn't have just been an economic agreement. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=302.24s)]
*  It would have been a lifeline for President Zelensky and his country. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=306.5s)]
*  If you have, you know, American companies and American miners exploring for those rare [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=310.14s)]
*  earth minerals in Ukraine, that serves as an incredible deterrent to Putin and to Russia. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=314.98s)]
*  And unfortunately, that deal wasn't signed because President Zelensky did not come into [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=319.62s)]
*  the Oval Office with the right mindset. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=323.5s)]
*  But he has said he would sign it now. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=324.74s)]
*  Well, we'll have to see. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=326.78s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=328.46s)]
*  Carolyn, I don't know when you rest because I saw you last night and then I'm watching [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=329.46s)]
*  you today, but you look wide awake and you're ready to go. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=332.7s)]
*  Are you liking the job? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=335.46s)]
*  I love the job. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=337.41999999999996s)]
*  And I'm looking forward to the speech tonight. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=338.41999999999996s)]
*  Everybody should tune in. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=339.41999999999996s)]
*  It will be must. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=340.41999999999996s)]
*  How long will it be? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=341.41999999999996s)]
*  About an hour. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=342.41999999999996s)]
*  But who knows? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=343.41999999999996s)]
*  It could always go a little bit longer. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=344.41999999999996s)]
*  We have great guests with great stories to tell. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=345.41999999999996s)]
*  Does the president worried about disruptions? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=347.58s)]
*  No, I don't think we're worried about that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=349.21999999999997s)]
*  I think, frankly, the Democrats should think about if they should stand up and applause [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=351.46s)]
*  for some of the things President Trump will be talking about. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=355.62s)]
*  He's bringing common sense back to this country. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=358.17999999999995s)]
*  Look at Democrats yesterday. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH-hLkiiWI&t=360.46s)]
