# Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire begins
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno)
*  All right, a Fox News order, a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah going into effect overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=0.0s)]
*  Benjamin Hall joins us live with more. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=6.0s)]
*  Benjamin, is it holding? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=8.0s)]
*  Well, so far, yes, it is, Brian. There have been a couple of firing, Israeli firings on Hezbollah cars, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=12.0s)]
*  but they say that that has been controlled at the moment. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=17.0s)]
*  But look, the ceasefire has been talked about for a few months now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=20.0s)]
*  It's been negotiated for a few months, and it should bring a 60-day ceasefire to the war against Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=22.0s)]
*  We saw celebrations across Lebanon yesterday, and not least because the day before was saw the heaviest Israeli bombing of Beirut since this war began. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=29.0s)]
*  The terms of the ceasefire as follows. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=38.0s)]
*  It will take place over 60 days. Israeli troops will withdraw, and Lebanese troops will replace Hezbollah. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=40.0s)]
*  The U.S. and France will monitor for violations, as well as the U.N., and Israel can defend itself in case of violations. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=47.0s)]
*  Hezbollah have agreed to withdraw north of the Laitani River. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=54.0s)]
*  That's 18 miles from Israel. And that is the same agreement they reached in 2006, with some critics now saying, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=57.0s)]
*  Hezbollah didn't abide back then, so why give them the breathing space now? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=63.0s)]
*  Many others, however, are supporting it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=67.0s)]
*  This product of hard work put by the U.S. government and our government and the Lebanese government, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=70.0s)]
*  I think the essential point to understand is that this deal was enabled by the fact that Israel [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=77.0s)]
*  significantly degraded Hezbollah over the last few months. Hezbollah is much weaker than it used to be. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=84.0s)]
*  Yeah, and look, there are benefits to both sides here. As you just heard, Hezbollah has indeed been totally degraded. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=92.0s)]
*  Their leadership, including Nasrallah, has been killed. You remember the pages exploding, wounding thousands of them. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=97.0s)]
*  And Iran supports this as well. They've said they don't want to lose, really, their most important proxy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=102.0s)]
*  On the Israeli side, the Israeli aim was to get the 60,000 displaced Israelis back home, and this allows that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=107.0s)]
*  But also remember that they are fighting on four fronts, and keeping a large scale operation inside Lebanon is going to be tough for them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=113.0s)]
*  And Benjamin Netanyahu said that this was an opportunity for them to set back and almost rearm. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=119.0s)]
*  Whether this leads to a negotiation and a ceasefire with Hamas is another question. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=123.0s)]
*  President Biden said yesterday he hoped and prayed, and he said he thought there would be one before the end of his term. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=127.0s)]
*  Hamas also opened to it as well, a leadership saying today they were open to a ceasefire. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=132.0s)]
*  So good news inside Lebanon at the moment, certainly for Hezbollah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=138.0s)]
*  It remains to be seen if Hamas can also reach a ceasefire as well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=141.0s)]
*  Fascinating time, Benjamin. Thanks so much. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=145.0s)]
*  It shows you what strength can do to bring peace. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=148.0s)]
*  Jim Hansen is chief editor of Middle East Four Army, served in the US Army Special Forces. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=150.0s)]
*  Who does the ceasefire work for? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=154.0s)]
*  It works best for Iran and Hezbollah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=158.0s)]
*  And Hamas may be the odd man out here because Israel is going to go back hard at them to try and finish that war. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=161.0s)]
*  I mean, ceasefires are good. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=168.0s)]
*  And this was a result of the Biden administration putting a soft embargo on some of the munitions and other supplies that Israel needed so they couldn't fight a two front war. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=170.0s)]
*  I think it's a sign of how desperate they are to have some sort of accomplishment in an otherwise dismal set of failures that's been their foreign policy. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=180.0s)]
*  But I understand too, Hamas has never been been they immediately the day of the October 7th attack, immediately Israel starts thinking we're going to go into Gaza. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=190.0s)]
*  October 8th Hezbollah shelling starts. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=201.0s)]
*  So the 60,000 people eventually have to evacuate from the north of their country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=204.0s)]
*  If those 60,000 can go back and they can get the IDF a break. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=209.0s)]
*  What do you think to studs for the hostages, the pursuit? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=215.0s)]
*  And what do you think it means for Iran, who's had their nuclear program damage and then missile defense destroyed? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=218.0s)]
*  I think the biggest win for Israel is if their people can return to their homes in northern Israel. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=224.0s)]
*  If Hezbollah withdraws north of the Latani River, which there was a UN resolution 1701 requiring that and the Lebanese government and army actually enforce that, which the US can make them do. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=231.0s)]
*  We pay them a lot of money. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=243.0s)]
*  So if we use that money as leverage and force them to stay up there, then Israel gets those those 100,000 plus people returning home. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=245.0s)]
*  That's great. Then they can go ahead. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=252.0s)]
*  And as I mentioned, finish the war against Hamas and then start figuring out what the end game is with Iran. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=254.0s)]
*  Ideally, the people of Iran decide they need a better government and go ahead and remove the mullahs themselves. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=261.0s)]
*  Then everyone can go ahead and breathe a little easier. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=268.0s)]
*  Jim, it's not a good time to be the grand ayatollah. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=271.0s)]
*  Trump's coming to town. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=273.0s)]
*  Maximum pressure is about to come back. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=274.0s)]
*  Their air defense has been destroyed. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=276.0s)]
*  Their radar has been destroyed. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=277.0s)]
*  The nuclear program has been damaged and they're out of their two big bodyguards Hamas and Hezbollah are flat on their backs. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=279.0s)]
*  Not a good time for Iran that Iranian government. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=285.0s)]
*  You're you're giving me all that joyous vibe there, Brian. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=289.0s)]
*  I like the way that sounds. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=293.0s)]
*  And the grand ayatollah and the rest of the leadership of the Islamic Republic should be worried. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=294.0s)]
*  They failed. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=299.0s)]
*  They put all of their chess pieces into play against Israel in a seven plus front war and they have failed miserably. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=300.0s)]
*  They've been you know, Hezbollah got wiped out essentially their entire leadership taken off the board. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=308.0s)]
*  Hamas is on its last legs. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=313.0s)]
*  The Houthis will will catch their trouble later. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=315.0s)]
*  So I think they're the ones now who have to be wondering how much time they've got left. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=317.0s)]
*  And, you know, Israel was was light on the places they hit. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=322.0s)]
*  They hit one new site that wasn't declared. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=326.0s)]
*  But I think they need to be worried about the rest of their toys in the homeland there. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=328.0s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes you have to have war to get peace. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=333.0s)]
*  Jim Hansen, thanks so much. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvGX-m6bno&t=335.0s)]
