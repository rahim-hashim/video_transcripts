# Musk reveals staggering DOGE numbers in closed-door GOP meeting
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs)
*  All right, Elon Musk is chipping away at his goal of $1 trillion in government spending cuts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=0.0s)]
*  And he laid out Doge's strategies during closed-door meetings in Washington yesterday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Ty Pyro joins us with the details. Good morning, Ty. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=10.56s)]
*  Hey guys, good morning to all of you. The CEO gathered with dozens of GOP leaders [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=12.8s)]
*  for back-to-back meetings at the Capitol on Wednesday where he shared updates on the progress [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=16.64s)]
*  of the Department of Government Efficiency, also known by Doge. You know that by now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=21.36s)]
*  Musk telling the roughly 40 senators that Doge's efforts are saving about $4 million per day. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=25.76s)]
*  He says they've already cut $105 billion in wasteful spending. That breaks down to over [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  $650 per taxpayer. The CEO telling lawmakers there's more to come. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=38.64s)]
*  Mr. Musk, what was your message in there to House Republicans? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=44.72s)]
*  What was your message in there? You know, there's a lot of opportunity to improve [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=48.160000000000004s)]
*  expenditures in the government and then we're making good progress. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=54.720000000000006s)]
*  This all comes after Democrat lawmakers join protesters opposing the spending cuts, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  while House Speaker Mike Johnson says Doge is making much-needed progress. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  This extraordinary work that Elon Musk is doing with Doge that he's explaining to our [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=68.64s)]
*  House Republicans tonight is transformative. It's really revolutionary in the way that we'll do [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=73.04s)]
*  budgeting. We'll limit the size and scope of the federal government and we'll be much more [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=77.36s)]
*  accountable to taxpayers in this country and that is long overdue. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=81.52s)]
*  Musk says he's looking to cut around $1 trillion in government waste. A lawmaker close to the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  department tells Fox News Digital, quote, the executive Doge team is confident they think they [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  can get $1 trillion. He acknowledged that. We're going to make some mistakes, but we're going to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  correct them very quickly. Back over to you. All right. Thanks so much, Todd. So right away, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=99.6s)]
*  if you asked Elon Musk, he wants to get rid of a whole department, National Environmental Policy [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=105.12s)]
*  Act. He goes, I'd get rid of the whole thing. Yesterday, Doug Collins came out and said, I'm [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=109.68s)]
*  looking at the VA. We could fire 80,000 employees. It's going through the secretary. And that to me [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=113.36000000000001s)]
*  shows it's some research. They're doing a fantastic job, but there is a sense inside that meeting [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=119.36000000000001s)]
*  that they want Elon Musk to start coordinating with a legal must group to coordinating with the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=124.72000000000001s)]
*  cabinet secretaries so they don't have the inevitable missteps that happen when you're [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=129.76000000000002s)]
*  trying to do this transformation that they're doing. The reason he wants, sorry, Lawrence, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  the reason he wants to get rid of NEPA, which is the National Environmental Policy Act that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=138.32s)]
*  you're talking about, Brian, he says it allows climate advocacy groups to challenge infrastructure [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=142.16s)]
*  and energy projects in court, which delays them. Scrapping NEPA would be a win for Republicans who [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=146.64s)]
*  want to develop and process energy faster, particularly from sources here in the United [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  States. And Brian, to your point of coordinating with the cabinet members as well as the members [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=157.6s)]
*  of Congress, I have no problem with that. The problem is going to come in is when the particular [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=164.4s)]
*  members of Congress starts calling Elon Musk and saying they want to sell programs, not be, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=169.36s)]
*  save programs, not because they're effective, but because it impacts their district. It has to be [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=174.24s)]
*  either the program is good or it's bad. If the program is bad, I don't care if it impacts your [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=179.6s)]
*  district. It's about the country right now. And they got to keep that message aligned. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=184.56s)]
*  Well, he talked about how easy it is to find the fraud and the waste. He said you don't have to be [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=190.88s)]
*  a detective. You don't have to be Sherlock. But to keep it out and to change the systems, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=194.64s)]
*  they talked about maybe having to codify it into law. But that brings lawmakers in. Everyone's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  going to act in their self-interest. But if you just work through the cabinet secretaries, at least [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=203.92s)]
*  all hands are on deck. And that's what was brought up yesterday. Everyone's for it. They just want to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=208.0s)]
*  be communicated to. And now that people are confirmed, they got about 18 cabinet members. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  Now they go to the deputy level and the assistant level. They're starting to build out so they really [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=216.72s)]
*  can make some progress. And they're talking about saving what? Four million a day. Imagine if you [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=221.11999999999998s)]
*  could save that much money. Pay off the debt. Yeah, pay off the debt and maybe give us all a little bit of a back. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61TOqYGwMUs&t=227.44s)]
