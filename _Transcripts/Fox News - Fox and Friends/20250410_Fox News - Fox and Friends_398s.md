# Kevin Hassett: This was Trump's plan all along
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg)
*  All right, stocks soaring after President Trump announcing a tariff pause for most nations for the, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=0.0s)]
*  those are for the reciprocal tariffs. Yesterday, the S&P 500 surging 9.5 percent, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=6.08s)]
*  its third best day since 1940. The president, however, is still pushing aggressively against [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=11.6s)]
*  China, raising tariffs even more against the communist nation to 125 percent. Meanwhile, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=17.68s)]
*  for the other nations, the reciprocal tariff have been paused for 90 days, but a 10 percent baseline [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=24.0s)]
*  will still be in place. We've got the best guest to talk about this. He is the director of the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=29.52s)]
*  National Economic Council. Kevin Hassett joins us from the North Lawn. Good morning to you, Kevin. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=34.64s)]
*  Good morning. Hey, guys. I see that shortly after they paused, you went into the Oval Office with [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=38.16s)]
*  some other high-ranking officials and you talked about, among other things, the fact that one of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=45.36s)]
*  the things that was freaking people out is there was a gigantic sell-off in the U.S. bond market. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=50.4s)]
*  And U.S. bonds, treasuries, have always been seen as the gold standard around the world, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=56.8s)]
*  and if there are cracks in that, we're all kind of screwed. Well, as an economist, I can say that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=60.8s)]
*  my judgment yesterday morning as I was watching interest rates climb up quite a bit, that a lot of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=66.16s)]
*  the people who normally buy U.S. treasuries were wondering whether the president was really serious [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=72.32s)]
*  about what he was saying when he was saying that we're going to renegotiate better deals for the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=77.28s)]
*  American people. And I knew he was serious, and he knew he was serious, and we had been working on [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=81.28s)]
*  plans for the negotiations for weeks, and even had a couple of deals lined up that maybe were close [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=87.44s)]
*  to being announced, and we're getting ready to talk about, well, what's the next stage? What's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=92.56s)]
*  the next step for the negotiations? I even, yesterday morning, was on a call with the president, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=97.44s)]
*  with the Swiss president, talking about a Swiss trade deal. And so the point is, everything was [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  moving, but then when the bond market started to say, hey, we don't believe these guys, I think the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=107.76s)]
*  president decided, on his own, really, that, well, we're going to announce this anyway, we might as [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=112.64s)]
*  well do it today. There's a little bit of an extra push for the bond market. But this is the plan that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=117.36s)]
*  he was pursuing all along. Oh, so did you know about that? Thank you, Lawrence. Did you know [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=121.92s)]
*  this was part of his plan? He was going to do this on Thursday? I knew that he had options that he [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  wanted us to prepare in a very orderly fashion, unanimity between everybody from Peter DeVaro [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=130.24s)]
*  to Howard Letnick to Scott Bessett to me, and vice president, he was also in on it. And the fact is, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=135.84s)]
*  that there were options for the president. That's always what he likes to see. And then he had the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=142.72s)]
*  options, and he was thinking about them. And then he made, I think, the absolutely right decisive call [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=146.88s)]
*  to go with really the bigger move, rather than announce one or two trade deals. We would go with [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=151.2s)]
*  the bigger move so that everybody in the world understands that he means what he says, that he [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=155.04s)]
*  wants people to be fair to American workers. And we saw so much progress, so much progress, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  in the last few weeks, once we started to announce that we're going to do this and then actually do it, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=165.2s)]
*  that the president was sure that the process was being successful, and so he could move ahead to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  the next step. So Kevin, let's talk China. And when you look at some of the numbers, it's pretty [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=173.04s)]
*  stunning. When you talk about the US exports to China, it's $143 billion, the imports from China [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=177.28s)]
*  are $438 billion. When you look at the deficit with China, it's negative $295 billion. So what's the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  goal, Kevin? Always to isolate China and push them to the negotiating table? It doesn't look like [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=194.16s)]
*  they're caving yet, but it looks like that's the president's goal, right? Well, I think his first [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=200.88s)]
*  goal always was to advantage American workers. Remember, when China entered the WTO, then for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=206.0s)]
*  the next 15 years, real wages in the United States went down by about $1,200 cubitably. So all those [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=212.4s)]
*  cheap products didn't make welfare better off for American citizens, because wages went down by more [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=218.88s)]
*  than prices because of the low demand for American workers. And so what President Trump's been doing [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=224.0s)]
*  is he's been trying to drive up demand for workers, drive up wages so that real welfare [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=228.8s)]
*  improves, and he's highly confident that this policy will accomplish it. There's going to be [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=233.68s)]
*  a lot of disruption for China right now because they've been dumping cheap goods into the US, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=237.6s)]
*  and doing so, I think, as a strategy that has national defense implications. And so what's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=242.88s)]
*  going on right now with China is that the ships that are filled with Chinese products don't know [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=249.36s)]
*  where to go. They're stuck in port. The factories that are making the Chinese goods are going to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=253.52s)]
*  have to slow down because they don't have ships to load the stuff into, and that's going to put a lot [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=258.64s)]
*  of pressure on China to stop its bad acting and to come to the table. Yeah. And Kevin, before the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=263.68s)]
*  president paused the tariffs, the Wall Street Journal says, and they talked to a couple of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=270.16s)]
*  people who were close to the president's thinking, the president knew, and he talked about how, you [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=276.0s)]
*  know, we're all going to feel some pain. You're going to feel some pain. He knew there was pain. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=282.32s)]
*  He knew tariffs could trigger a recession. His worry was that it would cause a depression. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=285.76s)]
*  Did you know that the president was concerned with a depression? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=294.56s)]
*  I think that you have to think about what the scenarios were that we were playing out for the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=300.0s)]
*  president. One scenario is that we come out with tariffs and non-tariff barriers that are at the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=304.56s)]
*  level of our trading partners, and they don't respond. And in that scenario, it's going to be [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=310.48s)]
*  pretty bad for the global economy. But the good news is that we're making America great again with [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=316.0s)]
*  Trump policies, but we're also rebuilding the global order because the other countries that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  are coming to the table are more or less going to be adopting Trump, you know, anti-globalist [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=325.68s)]
*  policies as well. And it's going to be great for their workers. It's going to be great for our [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=330.48s)]
*  workers. Kevin, what about the deals? What? We want to see deals. We want to see win after win [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=333.92s)]
*  after win. We want to see countries coming into the White House signing deals. When will that happen? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=338.24s)]
*  And which countries? Yeah, well, I'm not going to name the countries yet. In fact, we have a meeting [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=343.2s)]
*  today with all the top principals where we're going to present to the president a list of what [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=347.44s)]
*  we think his priorities might look like. And I'm sure he's going to have his own ideas about where [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=351.36s)]
*  to move things. But I could tell you that we've already got offers on the table for more than 15 [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=356.08s)]
*  countries. 15 countries. Now, that doesn't mean there's a deal, but it means that you've heard [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=361.2s)]
*  the much larger number for people who call and they want to talk. But there are specific offers [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=365.36s)]
*  on the table. I've been informed from USTR of about 15 countries right now. And so this is moving fast. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=369.68s)]
*  The thing that I joked about when we said the 90-day pause is that we're going to go around [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=375.68s)]
*  the world in 80 days and have 10 days of rest. That's our plan. Kevin, thanks for joining the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNvAdyTSowg&t=379.36s)]
