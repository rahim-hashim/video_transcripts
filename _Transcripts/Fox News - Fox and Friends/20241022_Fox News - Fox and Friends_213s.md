# Black voters, vulnerable Dems ‘running away’ from Harris in final weeks of campaign
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA)
*  So just two weeks to the election day and new polls show Vice President Kamala Harris losing ground with crucial blocks in her party. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=0.0s)]
*  They have always counted on the Latino voters, but they're now voting for Donald Trump by double digits. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=8.0s)]
*  The same poll showing her support among black voters hitting a record low with just 72 percent of them backing her. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=14.0s)]
*  To put it in that, in perspective, that's down 92 percent. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=22.0s)]
*  That's down from 92 percent from black voter support of the Democratic candidate back in 2016. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=26.0s)]
*  Fox News contributor and former Democrat Leo Terrell joins us now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=32.0s)]
*  So I found this poll just fascinating, Leo. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=35.0s)]
*  When you look at the support for Hillary Clinton, it was 92 percent of black support. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=39.0s)]
*  When you look for Joe Biden, it was 90 percent. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=42.0s)]
*  You got Kamala Harris at 78 percent. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=45.0s)]
*  The question is why? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=49.0s)]
*  Oh, it's very simple. Thanks for having me, Lawrence. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=52.0s)]
*  It's not in their best interest. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=54.0s)]
*  It's not in the interest of blacks and Hispanics to vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=57.0s)]
*  She hurts them economically. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=61.0s)]
*  They have seen nothing in progress over the last four years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=63.0s)]
*  And I want to be very clear. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=67.0s)]
*  The whole notion of the race card that Trump is racist is dead. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=68.0s)]
*  It no longer works. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=72.0s)]
*  And if he is a racist, why are Hispanics and blacks drifting towards him? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=73.0s)]
*  Because of situations like the barbershop yesterday where you were with him at the barbershop. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=78.0s)]
*  And blacks and Hispanics resonate with him and he resonates with them. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=83.0s)]
*  And I'll sit here and tell you, I left the Democrats in 2020, voted for Trump, and I voted for him already. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=88.0s)]
*  That is what's happening. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=94.0s)]
*  A shift economically is in blacks and Latinos' interest to vote for Donald J. Trump. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=95.0s)]
*  Well, it's strange, too, because she's not speaking to that issue. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=101.0s)]
*  Even with her plan for black males, she doesn't address the reason why black folks are turning to Donald Trump, especially the black males. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=105.0s)]
*  But I want to get to this because I find it very interesting that Democrats in these tough races are now crediting Donald Trump, trying to link themselves to it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=112.0s)]
*  Here's a montage. Watch. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=121.0s)]
*  Casey bucked Biden to protect fracking, and he sided with Trump to end NAFTA and put tariffs on China to stop them from cheating. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=124.0s)]
*  Tammy Baldwin got President Trump to sign her Made in America bill. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=132.0s)]
*  And then she got President Biden to make it permanent. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=136.0s)]
*  That's why I wrote a law signed by President Trump, forcing drug companies to show their actual prices. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=139.0s)]
*  This is wild to me. I don't see Republicans trying to link themselves to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=145.0s)]
*  Lawrence, I thought Donald Trump was a threat to democracy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=151.0s)]
*  I thought he was a danger to this country. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=155.0s)]
*  What you did, and Bob Casey voted to impeach him twice. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=158.0s)]
*  What you saw here was an admission from Democrats that Trump policies work for America, and they're running away from Kamala Harris. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=161.0s)]
*  They're running away from Joe Biden. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=171.0s)]
*  They're running away from the Democrat policy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=173.0s)]
*  This is an outright admission that Donald Trump has a policy that will make all Americans great, regardless of skin color or ethnicity. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=176.0s)]
*  People keep asking me, do you believe the polls that Donald Trump is taking advantage? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=186.0s)]
*  I say, I don't have to look at the polls. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=190.0s)]
*  I'm looking at the Democrats change their messaging. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=193.0s)]
*  That tells me everything I need to know. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=195.0s)]
*  Leo, thanks so much for joining the program this morning. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=197.0s)]
*  Thank you, Lawrence. Thanks for having me. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=201.0s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA&t=202.0s)]
