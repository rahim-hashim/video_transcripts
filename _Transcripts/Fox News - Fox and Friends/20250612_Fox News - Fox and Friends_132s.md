# 'ABSOLUTE MORON': Far-left mayor makes SHOCKING ICE comparison
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY)
*  Well, Chicago is bracing for an influx of federal agents to be deployed for more immigration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=0.0s)]
*  raids and the mayor, Brandon Johnson, is encouraging the residents to resist and compares [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=6.0s)]
*  these ICE raids to the Confederacy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=12.0s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=14.0s)]
*  I remember a few standups ago when I talked about what terrorism looks like. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=15.0s)]
*  This is it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=22.66s)]
*  There should be no question to what our country would look like had the Confederacy won. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=23.66s)]
*  We're seeing it on full display. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=29.98s)]
*  What an absolute moron. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=32.46s)]
*  Do you realize that the black slaves that came to this country had to experience three [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=36.06s)]
*  constitutional amendments? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=40.3s)]
*  There was a legal process even after coming to the country, unwillingly, and now he wants [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=42.34s)]
*  to just allow people to come across the border with no consequences at all? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=48.66s)]
*  Meanwhile, what about all the black residents that are going to his city council meeting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=53.14s)]
*  We don't want them here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=58.02s)]
*  They're taking over our services, kicking people out of schools. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=59.02s)]
*  Some of the senior housing has been taken over. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=62.78s)]
*  Do they feel like it's the Confederacy as well? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=65.14s)]
*  It's such an emotional argument that lacks any historical real analysis. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=67.5s)]
*  And causing more crime in Chicago. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=73.02000000000001s)]
*  And their governor is going to be grilled. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=74.78s)]
*  I hope grilled today. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=76.62s)]
*  Some saluted like Crockett's on this panel, too. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=77.82000000000001s)]
*  Illinois Governor Pritzker, Hokel and Walz, look at how much money they've spent. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=80.10000000000001s)]
*  Instead of putting it to the people who legitimately belong in Chicago, New York, and Minneapolis, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=83.86s)]
*  Illinois spent $2.5 billion on migrant care by the end of this year. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=90.86s)]
*  New York, $4.3 billion over the course of two years. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=95.06s)]
*  So that money is going to the people that Mayor Brandon Johnson wants to support. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=100.14s)]
*  There's people here, let alone the criminals amongst them. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=105.42s)]
*  He was a teacher. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=107.82s)]
*  Can you imagine this guy teaching your kids this type of nonsense? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=108.82s)]
*  It's scary. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=112.02000000000001s)]
*  It reminds me of exactly why everyone's alarmed about public schools. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=113.02000000000001s)]
*  And they're having a Mark Trenor rally on Saturday from 12 to 2 in Chicago to resist [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=116.22s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ye1y5P-hY&t=120.66s)]
