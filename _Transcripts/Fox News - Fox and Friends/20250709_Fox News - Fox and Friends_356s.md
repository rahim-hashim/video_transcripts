# NY man arrested for threatening to shoot, kill ICE agents
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU)
*  Meanwhile, the assaults and threat environment that our ICE and Border Patrol agents are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=0.0s)]
*  facing is unprecedented and we have the latest incident coming now, we learned yesterday, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=5.68s)]
*  out of Buffalo, New York, upstate New York, a man has been charged, arrested and charged [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=12.16s)]
*  with threatening to kill ICE agents. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=18.2s)]
*  His name is James White, he's 43 years old and what he was put, Matthew White, excuse [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  me, was putting just unbelievable threats on X. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=28.0s)]
*  We can show them to you here, you see just three examples, April 18th, kill them all, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=31.28s)]
*  ICE is the new age, Gestapo stopped them, April 29th, then understand that if your ICE [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=36.04s)]
*  agents don't show proof of identity and a signed warrant, we will kill them. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=41.84s)]
*  That by the way was a threat, responding to a video of Tom Homan and then also in April, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  this one, I can't wait to put a bullet into this guy's brain, but first, his children. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=52.82s)]
*  You know there's no excuse for any of this and that guy belongs in jail, but you know [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=59.86s)]
*  it is sort of a, almost, it's an illogical progression, but it is a progression from [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=66.18s)]
*  when you have all of these politicians saying, minus the threats of violence, but saying [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=70.9s)]
*  about ICE agents and the Trump administration, but specifically ICE agents who are sent out [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=77.96s)]
*  in terms of calling them the Gestapo, calling them Nazis, calling them terrorists, the idea [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  that you are sending these ICE agents out to enforce the law that politicians put on [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  the books and you can't be surprised that you wind up with a wacko who takes it a step [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=96.88s)]
*  further and starts calling for violence. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=104.36s)]
*  Yeah, and even though we're seeing the increase in attacks and the calls for violence, this [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=105.84s)]
*  is where Democrats are focusing their energy on calling to unmask these ICE agents. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  The bill is actually pretty straightforward. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  No face coverings, no masks, whether you're a citizen, a legal resident or an undocumented [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  immigrant and somebody without these identifiers is approaching you, masked up, coming out [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=126.56s)]
*  of a marked car. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=133.16s)]
*  You have no idea what's going on. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=134.16s)]
*  Every single ICE agent who's engaged in this aggressive overreach and are trying to hide [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  their identities from the American people, every single one of them, no matter what it [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=145.16s)]
*  takes, no matter how long it takes, will of course be identified. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=150.76s)]
*  If everything is legitimate and proper, why are you wearing masks? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  Folks getting snatched off the street by secret police who are wearing masks. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to introduce legislation that essentially says no more masked federal agents in our [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=163.56s)]
*  community. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=169.16s)]
*  Only the bad guys wear masks. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=169.76s)]
*  So you want to know who's focusing their energy on that, the Visible Act. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=172.36s)]
*  These are just some of the Senate co-sponsors, including Cory Booker, Alex Padilla, Richard [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=176.16s)]
*  Blumenthal and others. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=181.36s)]
*  And the condemnation of the violence and the attacks would be appreciated for all who are [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=183.76s)]
*  seeing this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=188.96s)]
*  But again, this is where they're choosing to focus their time and energy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=189.56s)]
*  It's just unfathomable as you see these ICE agents, you know, every single day you have ICE, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=193.56s)]
*  DHS, CBP, Border Patrol putting out incidences of child rapists, people who have been convicted [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=201.16s)]
*  of homicide, people that have assaulted others. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=208.36s)]
*  These are the criminals, the more than 500, 600,000 illegal criminal aliens in this country [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=211.36s)]
*  that the American people voted to not only shut down the border but remove them from the country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=217.16s)]
*  All these agents are doing are carrying out federal immigration law and it is the acquiescence [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=222.16s)]
*  of lawmakers in Washington that are giving a green light. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=228.76s)]
*  Whether you see it directly or not, it seems it's pretty direct when you have Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=232.16s)]
*  the leader of House Democrats, calling ICE agents Gestapo saying, we want you to resist this [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=238.16s)]
*  for a political end, not for the safety of communities from coast to coast. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=244.56s)]
*  And I think it's kind of interesting that they've come up with this idea of a mask ban for [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=249.56s)]
*  federal agents. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=254.56s)]
*  Where was this idea of a mask ban when we had all of the riots and all of the mayhem caused in, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=255.56s)]
*  you know, among private citizens, their homes were burned, their businesses were burned, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=264.56s)]
*  people, the violence on the streets by masked marauders, of course, they never mentioned [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=270.56s)]
*  the idea of face mask bans for that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=276.56s)]
*  But then as soon as you start trying to bring order to the streets and as you point out, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=280.56s)]
*  Griff, enforce the laws that are on the books as voters asked them to do in the last election, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=285.56s)]
*  then they suddenly want to ban masks for ICE agents. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=294.56s)]
*  Yeah, and there's a real problem with morale right now as they're trying to carry out their job. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=298.56s)]
*  Griff, you know this. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=302.56s)]
*  We talked to officials all the time who say suffer them show up and go to do their job every day. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=303.56s)]
*  These ICE agents, they leave their families, they leave their spouses, they leave their homes to go do their [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=308.56s)]
*  jobs with this risk of attack every day and knowing that there are lawmakers OK with the calls for violence against them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=314.56s)]
*  Why aren't they calling for these protesters that in many instances we saw a guy with a skateboard [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=323.56s)]
*  smashing ICE facility windows. Have they been arrested? Have they been prosecuted? Are they being held to account? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=329.56s)]
*  I mean, free speech is a cornerstone of our democracy. But when you're violently attacking federal law enforcement officers, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=335.56s)]
*  that ain't free speech. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDV0D8lBrU&t=343.56s)]
