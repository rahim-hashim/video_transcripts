# ‘SENSELESS’: The Democrats’ policy reality is ‘ugly’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A)
*  Education Secretary Miguel Cardona announces a back to school bus tour in early September, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=0.0s)]
*  which just happens to go across battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  to on the taxpayer dime, remind Americans of the Biden Harris record on schools. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=16.2s)]
*  While the Democrat nominee Kamala Harris only mentioned education one time in her DNC speech, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=23.36s)]
*  it wasn't exactly a policy outline. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=28.6s)]
*  We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  schools. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=37.800000000000004s)]
*  We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and childcare [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=38.800000000000004s)]
*  for our children. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  We're not going to fund anything. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  Joining us now is Fox News contributor and former education secretary under Ronald Reagan, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=49.16s)]
*  Bill Bennett. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=54.32s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, it's great to see you as always. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=55.32s)]
*  She hasn't not only did she say much there about education, she hasn't said much at [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=57.68s)]
*  all. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=62.4s)]
*  And her speech was full of platitude, very thin on any particular policy. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=63.4s)]
*  Is she going to get away with this? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=67.2s)]
*  No, she can't. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=69.48s)]
*  Look, the Democrat convention, the appearance is attractive, but the reality is ugly and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=71.56s)]
*  bad and awful and senseless. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=81.48s)]
*  Whether you're talking about the border, whether you're talking about the economy, or here, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=85.96s)]
*  whether you're talking about education, he's going to do a tour. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  What's he going to do? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=91.08s)]
*  A tour of empty classrooms, which was, remember Randy Weingarten, the head of the teachers [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=92.08s)]
*  union? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  We can't open the schools, we can't open the schools. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=99.96s)]
*  Maybe he'll tour empty schools or schools with seven-year-olds with masks on because [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=102.44s)]
*  that was their policy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=108.16s)]
*  They certainly didn't increase math and reading scores. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=109.61999999999999s)]
*  We have an expression called the joy of learning. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=113.36s)]
*  My wife, who is in the schools, tells me, and she's been in more recently than I have, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=116.36s)]
*  the learning's not there and the joy's not there. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  They have not been good for American education. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=124.36s)]
*  No doubt at all. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=126.83999999999999s)]
*  If we have to get a stance from her on education, Mr. Secretary, we need to go back to her 2020 [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=128.44s)]
*  platform, because she hasn't laid anything out recently. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=133.44s)]
*  She was for universal preschool, of course teacher pay raises, targeted student loan [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=137.56s)]
*  forgiveness in the California when she was a senator, grants for school diversity initiative, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=141.88s)]
*  education for girls and minorities when she was the D.A., again, more debt forgiveness. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=148.24s)]
*  So there was a lot of us had to do with more money. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=153.68s)]
*  And you've seen as the education secretary, does more money equal better outcomes? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=156.76s)]
*  And you talk about that joy, have these diversity and equity inclusion programs they pushed [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  into all across our classrooms, has that increased the educational benefit for kids? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=165.4s)]
*  No, the joy has increased. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=171.12s)]
*  The tension has increased because of D.A. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=172.88s)]
*  I. But you smartly point out that list of hers. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=175.92s)]
*  It's money, money, money, money. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=180.76s)]
*  And I expect to feed does a tour of the current education secretary of those battleground [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  states, it'll he'll have his checkbook. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=188.6s)]
*  And that's what they'll talk about. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=191.44s)]
*  They have given a ton of money. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=193.76s)]
*  Of course, that's their that's their constituency. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=196.0s)]
*  What Pete, maybe 30, 40 percent of the people at that convention were members of a union, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=198.88s)]
*  teachers union or married to a member of the teachers union. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=203.88s)]
*  Huge representation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=206.84s)]
*  And it's you know, it's a bribe basically. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  And we know that more money doesn't mean better schools. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=211.88s)]
*  Can you think of an issue that's more clarifying between the left and the right these days [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=216.08s)]
*  than education? I mean, you're right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=219.68s)]
*  The left is totally captured by public school interests and money, whereas you've seen a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=221.28s)]
*  renaissance in school choice from conservatives and red states that want to give parents [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=227.56s)]
*  more choice. Also, you know, they define freedom as freedom to have these smutty books in the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=232.04s)]
*  classroom for minors. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=237.0s)]
*  I mean, education is a really clear fault line. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=239.8s)]
*  Yeah, I know I'm a part of the Education Freedom Alliance for school choice and obviously [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  choice matters. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=249.24s)]
*  Content matters as well. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=251.2s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=253.6s)]
*  Maybe the only more clarifying issue would be the border, you know, in favor of opening [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=254.2s)]
*  the border or having restrictions at the border. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=259.84s)]
*  And my God, once again, back to my theme, they have this attractive presentation, but [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=263.24s)]
*  the reality that they want has to be avoided. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=270.36s)]
*  So policy, policy, policy. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=274.24s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump has to keep pushing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=276.44s)]
*  Got to draw her out. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  She's got to do some interviews. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=279.76s)]
*  So as the days go on, days go on, Pete, I doubt that she's going to do a lot of interviews, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=281.6s)]
*  maybe none, except with very friendly press. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=287.88s)]
*  You're right. Why would she when they'll cover for her in the process? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=290.64s)]
*  Bill Bennett, as always, wise words. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=294.04s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=295.48s)]
*  Thank you, Pete. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV89SXWPM0A&t=297.6s)]
