# A 'F--- UP': Shocking new video from Trump assassination attempt reveals officers' confusion
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo)
*  So to another possible brand new body cam footage from the Trump assassination [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=0.0s)]
*  attempt showing an officer's brief encounter with the shooter. Shelly [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=4.12s)]
*  painter has the story. Hey, generally good morning, Lawrence. So this new [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=7.92s)]
*  body cam is a shocking look at the chaos, confusion and disorganized nature [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  of the security response among and between local police and Secret [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=16.0s)]
*  Service agents just before and after a gunman opened fire at the Trump rally [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=19.56s)]
*  in Butler last month, including this Butler Township officer who had a [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=24.44s)]
*  chance to stop the whole thing, spotting the gunman on the roof about 30 [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=28.96s)]
*  seconds before the shooting. You can see him here being hoisted up some 12 [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  ft to the roof of the A. G. R. Building by a fellow officer before quickly [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=36.64s)]
*  dropping back down to the ground. Seconds later, shots rang out when 20 [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=40.88s)]
*  year old Thomas Crooks opened fire, striking Trump and two other rally [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=45.160000000000004s)]
*  goers and killing another. This officer later on body cam is heard saying he [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=48.8s)]
*  saw the armed man up there on the rooftop with an air rifle laying next [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  to a backpack. And in the aftermath, other videos show officers desperately [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=58.4s)]
*  racing towards that building, trying to access the roof and make not not the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=63.2s)]
*  gunman. Um, and they make out that the gunman could have used a wood pile [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=68.76s)]
*  leaning onto the building. That's maybe how he accessed the roof. And in this [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=73.84s)]
*  video, officers can be heard clearly confused as to why that roof was [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=77.8s)]
*  unmanned in the first place here. Butler Township police officer telling a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=81.2s)]
*  Secret Service agent he believed they were supposed to be protecting the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=84.28s)]
*  roof of the A. G. R. Building. Listen to this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=87.96s)]
*  I don't want to spread. No, no, no. He's a shooter. Did he have a weapon? Is [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=91.16s)]
*  he? That was that was the report. I thought you were on the roof. I thought [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=93.91999999999999s)]
*  it was you. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=97.63999999999999s)]
*  I thought you guys were on the roof. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=99.55999999999999s)]
*  Why are we not on the roof? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=103.05999999999999s)]
*  You guys somewhere over the left. Why? Why weren't we? I'd say this is a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=106.16s)]
*  up. Sorry. Not your wish. Gas company. Somebody [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  job. And even further, more video shows one local officer livid as he keeps [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=113.08s)]
*  repeating on video that he told the Secret Service to secure that building [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  days before, but they didn't listen to him. Lawrence. It's unbelievable. I [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=122.78s)]
*  think when the officer said it was an F up, I think that's the officer that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=126.92s)]
*  got it right. Chandler. Thanks so much. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=130.3s)]
*  Let's bring in Tim Clemente, former FBI special agent who's living in Montana [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=133.57999999999998s)]
*  and he's going to the Trump rally tonight. So when you have local officers [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=137.88s)]
*  saying, Look, we told the Secret Service to get on top of the roof and then [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  you got Secret Service days after the shooting blaming the locals. What do [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=146.48s)]
*  you make of all of this nonsense? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, Lawrence, if the local police were responsible for the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=154.56s)]
*  security of this protect the you might be able to point the finger at them, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=157.84s)]
*  but they weren't. Responsibility lies completely and totally with the Secret [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=161.34s)]
*  Service. The shift leader is responsible for the immediate personnel right [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  around the the protect the in this case, Donald Trump. And then there is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=170.12s)]
*  other layers and perimeter layers that are built in by the Secret Service [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=174.36s)]
*  that involve local state and other federal authorities, and they are [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  responsible. They're the ultimate arbiter of what is to be secured and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=183.44s)]
*  how it should be secured. There was no communication obviously between the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  Secret Service and these officers and there was no communication on that day [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=191.36s)]
*  when the officers and the bystander saw things and that never got to Trump's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  detail, never got to the counter sniper teams. It was just I think an F up is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  the minimum you could call this. Tim, I'm still puzzled by all of them. This [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=205.72s)]
*  is clearly malpractice was going on gross incompetence. What was the command [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=210.11999999999998s)]
*  station? What was the post where they could have comms going back? You have [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=215.66s)]
*  no comms with the locals that are on the outside. Someone was supposed to be on [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  the roof and they decided according to some reports did not show up that day. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=223.4s)]
*  You got Secret Service agents and other counter snipers that are confused if [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=228.16s)]
*  it was their guy that was on the top of the roof and they're saying, Look, we [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=232.8s)]
*  were actually inside of the building, not on top of the building. There was no [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=235.88s)]
*  communication at all. Tim, it's incomprehensible. You know, let's go [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  back a couple of decades to 9 11. There was a tragedy in New York because the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=244.8s)]
*  fire department and the police department were not communicating on [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=248.96s)]
*  that day in New York at the World Trade Center. And so the police department [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=252.12s)]
*  helicopter sees the buildings are coming down, warns other law enforcement [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  doesn't warn the fire department. That lack of communication led to a lot of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=259.36s)]
*  changes in incident command. An incident command is what is used by the federal [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=263.48s)]
*  government, local state authorities in almost any type of incident to make sure [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=267.6s)]
*  that communication is the paramount thing because it's the first thing that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  falls through in any operation. And in this case, you know, this I could see [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  this may be happening in the 19 fifties or sixties, but not today. It's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=280.76s)]
*  it's completely unacceptable. It's unacceptable. And you speak of 9 11 [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=284.96s)]
*  part of what took place then is creating homeland security. So agencies [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  could start talking to each other, secret services on the homeland, and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=294.2s)]
*  they weren't able to get this right. I hope to get to some type of answers [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=297.36s)]
*  through Congress. Tim, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwGxiwsu7Fo&t=301.71999999999997s)]
