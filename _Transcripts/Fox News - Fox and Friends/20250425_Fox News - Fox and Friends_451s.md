*  magazine. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=16.64s)]
*  The president claims that he's made 200 trade deals that we haven't heard anything announced [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=17.64s)]
*  yet and he's also expressing optimism. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=21.68s)]
*  He says that these trade deal processes will all finish up in the next three to four weeks. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  The president likened these trade deals and his role in it is almost like a store manager. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=29.72s)]
*  This is what he told Time quote, it's a giant beautiful store and everybody wants to go [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=34.44s)]
*  shopping there and on behalf of the American people I own the store. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=39.019999999999996s)]
*  I set the prices and I'll say if you want to shop here this is what you have to pay. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=43.519999999999996s)]

*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson says the administration's had very successful talks with South Korea [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=55.04s)]
*  that the two countries will be talking technical terms as early next week. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  President also says the U.S. and China are actively talking though Chinese officials [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=63.48s)]
*  say there have been no productive negotiations. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  Now this interview touched on a number of different subjects. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=70.44s)]
*  The reporter asked President Trump if he'd be willing to meet with Iran's supreme leader. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=73.24s)]
*  Trump said sure. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=77.36s)]
*  This has the two countries are in the middle of negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=78.92s)]
*  They've had a couple of meetings so far. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=82.6s)]
*  The next session is scheduled for tomorrow. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=87.72s)]
*  Rich. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=89.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=90.28s)]
*  Rich a really long interview with Time magazine many of which are some of the questions that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=91.28s)]
*  they ask. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=94.16s)]
*  One of the questions about Doge you have a godlike approach to the budget. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=95.16s)]
*  He goes what a crazy question. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=98.32s)]
*  He goes why you why you ask that question. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=100.68s)]
*  It's about finding fraud and abuse. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=102.28s)]
*  Why wouldn't you want to find that out. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=103.68s)]
*  But Trump is listening to he's interviewing with the Atlantic and he's interviewing with [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  Time magazine and no holes barred 100 days in. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=109.36s)]
*  He talked they talked about the first 100 days and talked about a wide variety of issues [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=112.6s)]
*  but he said the reporter says it seems like you're expanding your power as president. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=116.6s)]
*  He said I'm not expanding my power. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=120.64s)]
*  I'm just using it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=122.48s)]
*  We are resetting the table. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=124.0s)]
*  He said we lost two trillion dollars per year on trade during the last administration. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=125.08s)]
*  He said at some point we have to stop this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=130.16s)]
*  And he said we are earning now 25 percent more on cars 25 percent more on steel and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=132.64s)]
*  aluminum. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=137.48s)]
*  He said we're going to have an explosion upward in the not too distant future. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=138.48s)]
*  This is what we call radical transparency. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean the guy is willing to talk to absolutely anybody anybody that he doesn't care what [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=145.44s)]
*  you've written about him in the past. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=150.24s)]
*  And you know obviously it creates real problems sometimes for people who work for him. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=151.8s)]
*  But it's what I think that we you know it's what you expect what you should expect out [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  of a free country. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=163.76s)]
*  Your leader actually answers questions and talks to people. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=164.88s)]
*  He said this is what I ran on. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  They asked him about Doge and the courts challenging him and they said weakening law firms and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  universities. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  He said this is what I campaigned on. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=176.68s)]
*  I'm using my power as as per the election. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=178.28s)]
*  So we know this when it comes to the tariff talk. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=181.72000000000003s)]
*  He said I got 200 deals ready to go. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  When are you going to announce him in the next few weeks. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=186.56s)]
*  Yesterday. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=188.24s)]
*  Well two days ago we heard that maybe 18 deals are ready to go. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  And then we hear in principle some things. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=193.28000000000003s)]
*  South Korea we saw the secretary of treasury yesterday say South Korea is moving really [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=196.28000000000003s)]
*  quick quicker than we thought we might be. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  We're moving them up in terms of that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  But one thing about China they have stopped buying our pork. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=204.64s)]
*  So that's going to hurt farmers. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  So I think pork imports are now facing 172 percent tariff. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=211.28s)]
*  So China is going to not buy 12000 metric tons of US pork shipments. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=215.88s)]
*  So they also have turned around the Boeing planes and said we no longer want them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  Your only other choice is Airbus. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=225.56s)]
*  You have to go order them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  Either you need nine planes or you don't. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=228.32s)]
*  You got to make them. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=230.16s)]
*  So Trump President Trump ripped China yesterday and said Are you kidding me. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=230.92s)]
*  You're actually sending Boeing planes back. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=234.88s)]
*  So I get the sense that both sides are staring each other down and not budging. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=236.96s)]
*  And I do know that it looks like China is backing off something else. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=242.76s)]
*  They are the China has quietly rolled back retaliatory tariffs on some some US made [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=249.84s)]
*  semiconductors because there's no substitute for the semiconductors that we make. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=255.92s)]
*  So I get the sense and the markets are waiting for this. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=261.0s)]
*  And I watched Brian Moynihan last night. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  Citibank CEO Citibank or he's with the big banks one of the big banks. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=266.08s)]
*  And he says we're just waiting. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=273.04s)]
*  We're waiting to see what's going to happen with these deals. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=274.2s)]
*  But especially China not even saying what the deals are going to be. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=277.04s)]
*  But just maybe this is the deal. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=280.8s)]
*  Maybe they say OK pork's too expensive. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=282.2s)]
*  We're not going to buy it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  But we need your semiconductors and we still need that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=285.16s)]
*  So we're going to lower the tariffs on that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=287.8s)]
*  Maybe this is part of the negotiation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=289.12s)]
*  Do we have to write a check to the farmers. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=290.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  Because you know this all of a sudden you're not able to sell or the president Trump finds [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=292.88s)]
*  other countries that need pork and say don't buy it from X Y and Z. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=298.04s)]
*  Buy it from us. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=302.88s)]
*  Right. And in Spain is now they're going to China is going to go buy it from Spain. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=303.68s)]
*  And the sticking point is that you know Trump talks about how America is this great big [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=307.32s)]
*  giant beautiful store and it is and there's lots of great products here. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=311.88s)]
*  But we're also the biggest customers for a place like China and they need consumers. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=316.0s)]
*  Yeah. We're the best consumers. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=322.32s)]
*  They and they need us. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=323.44s)]
*  And the question is who needs who more. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=324.76s)]
*  And I think the Trump administration is banking that China ultimately needs us more than we [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  need their plastic. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=332.32s)]
*  Donald Trump in the article he talked about meeting with the CEOs of Wal-Mart and Target [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=333.32s)]
*  and Home Depot and he said they are for these tariffs. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  Wal-Mart they reported their first quarter revenue or what do you call that the first [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=340.44s)]
*  quarter whatever how much they've made. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=345.96s)]
*  And they said they have not seen. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=347.96s)]
*  Yeah. They have. Thank you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  They have done better and said that they have not lost business because of this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=351.4s)]
*  And they said it was either 70 or 80 percent of all their products in their store made [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  in America. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=359.88s)]
*  This is by analogy and I think it's brilliant. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  Before I just kind of warn you if you're an archer you pull you pull the bow back. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=362.4s)]
*  And what he's doing it with interior they're drilling they're going to have they're [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  starting to drill in the Gulf of America massively. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzNuSS0eOY&t=372.72s)]
