# Fox News’ hosts crack up over 'The View's' Trump meltdown
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc)
*  More fun that's happening, more fun than is happening on The View. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was appointment viewing all week actually. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=4.0s)]
*  It really was. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=6.0s)]
*  I actually had a lot of fun watching these clips. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=7.0s)]
*  I mean, it was the first time on Wednesday that I knew it was 11 o'clock. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=9.0s)]
*  I watched a lot of another number. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=12.0s)]
*  I needed to see. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=14.0s)]
*  I needed to see. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=15.0s)]
*  And The View delivered. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=17.0s)]
*  And The View delivered though. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=18.0s)]
*  It did. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=19.0s)]
*  Yeah, The View did. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=20.0s)]
*  They always do with their books. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=21.0s)]
*  It was Bitterness and Condescension brought to you by Botox and Ozempic. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=22.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=24.0s)]
*  It was so good. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=25.0s)]
*  It was so, I saw that tweet. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=26.0s)]
*  I saw that tweet. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=27.0s)]
*  I saw it and I almost retreated you back. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=28.0s)]
*  Best tweet ever from Will Cade. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=31.0s)]
*  I'll let you here just enjoy the schadenfreude. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=33.0s)]
*  The way that the left speaks to its voters, it really is. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=38.0s)]
*  Give me a message of joy and inclusiveness. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=43.0s)]
*  No, the message of not being educated, being dumb, and what's wrong with America. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=45.0s)]
*  Who said that? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=49.0s)]
*  Sonny just did. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=50.0s)]
*  What is wrong with America? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=51.0s)]
*  My point here is that... [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=52.0s)]
*  That's not what Kamala Harris said. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=53.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=55.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=56.0s)]
*  My point is, I don't blame Joe Biden. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=57.0s)]
*  I don't blame Kamala Harris. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=59.0s)]
*  Go back as far as you want. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=60.0s)]
*  I believe, I blame a messaging within the Democratic Party. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=61.0s)]
*  You don't blame the Republican Party at all? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=65.0s)]
*  Can I just finish my point please? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=66.0s)]
*  I obviously have a problem, anyone has a problem with Donald Trump. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=67.0s)]
*  The bigger question should be, yes Sonny, why did they vote for him? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=70.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=73.0s)]
*  In sweeping... [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=74.0s)]
*  So they need to be introspective. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=75.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=76.0s)]
*  We need to be introspective. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=77.0s)]
*  If we voted for Kamala Harris, we need to say what didn't resonate with the voters. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=78.0s)]
*  So good. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=83.0s)]
*  The winners need to be introspective. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=84.0s)]
*  They need to be introspective. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=85.0s)]
*  I don't need to do anything. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=86.0s)]
*  You know, I saw you like, speaking of tweets, I saw you like this one. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=88.0s)]
*  I said, I'm headed to New York City. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=93.0s)]
*  I can't wait to show up to my Upper West Side social engagements. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=95.0s)]
*  I'm going to walk in and just pimp walk. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=98.0s)]
*  So I was pimp walking into some of these social engagements last night. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=101.0s)]
*  And one of my buddies did go, at some point, do you ever look up and go, could I be wrong? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=106.0s)]
*  Not me. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=111.0s)]
*  Like the side that just got... [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=112.0s)]
*  You said that to your friend. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=113.0s)]
*  No, he said it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=114.0s)]
*  You know, even talking about his friends. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=115.0s)]
*  Talking about like, rest of the world. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=116.0s)]
*  Because people like Sonny Hosten have tripled down on like, it's your fault. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=118.0s)]
*  Your sexism. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=122.0s)]
*  America's misogynistic. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=123.0s)]
*  Right, okay. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=124.0s)]
*  America's racist. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=125.0s)]
*  It's the patriarchy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=126.0s)]
*  It's misogyny. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=127.0s)]
*  It's racism. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=128.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=129.0s)]
*  Could it be me? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=130.0s)]
*  No, it's a great question. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=131.0s)]
*  You know what's happening here guys, this meltdown, is of course they live in their [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=132.0s)]
*  Manhattan bubbles. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=137.0s)]
*  All of them, even though it's a multiracial group of ladies right there, they live in [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=138.0s)]
*  this Manhattan bubble. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=141.0s)]
*  And I'll tell you what it's indicative of. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=142.0s)]
*  It's indicative of the fact that as much as, you know, Democrats love their identity politics [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=144.0s)]
*  and their intersectionality. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=149.0s)]
*  They're so tied to it because they've been able to control people through that politically [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=150.0s)]
*  and culturally. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=155.0s)]
*  But it's all collapsing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=156.0s)]
*  And it's not working anymore. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=157.0s)]
*  And everybody is so multiracial anyway. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=159.0s)]
*  I mean, everyone's intermarrying. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=162.0s)]
*  And the real indicators of who you're going to vote for and who you're loyal to is your [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=163.0s)]
*  race. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=168.0s)]
*  I mean, it's not your race. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=169.0s)]
*  It's your income level. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=170.0s)]
*  It's your marital status. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=171.0s)]
*  It's your religion. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=173.0s)]
*  I mean, look, just look at us. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=174.0s)]
*  We're not, I'm Hispanic. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=176.0s)]
*  You guys are not. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=178.0s)]
*  But we have a lot in common. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=179.0s)]
*  We have a lot in common and it's really about those other things. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=182.0s)]
*  That's what America used to be about, the common values that we shared. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=185.0s)]
*  And then they put us in all these silos. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=188.0s)]
*  Then the silos have collapsed. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=190.0s)]
*  We'll look surprised. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=191.0s)]
*  He thinks you're Latino. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=192.0s)]
*  To your point, no, to your point, they're all on that table and they're different, but [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=193.0s)]
*  they're all the same. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=198.0s)]
*  They're the same in that they look down their nose at America. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=199.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=203.0s)]
*  And that's why there's so much confusion because when things collapse, you look around and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=204.0s)]
*  you don't want to blame yourself. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=207.0s)]
*  You want to say it's somebody else's fault. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=209.0s)]
*  Maybe you have grown completely out of touch with the way average people live. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=211.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're snobs, you guys. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=215.0s)]
*  Those ladies are snobs. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=217.0s)]
*  Do you see the way Sunny talked about people who don't have college degrees? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=218.0s)]
*  She called them the uneducated. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=222.0s)]
*  No, uneducated women specifically. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=223.0s)]
*  He said uneducated women. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=225.0s)]
*  White women. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=227.0s)]
*  White women. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=228.0s)]
*  I don't get why they're naming white women again. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=229.0s)]
*  Dripping in condescension and yeah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=231.0s)]
*  Just brains are broken. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=233.0s)]
*  They're just broken. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=235.0s)]
*  Can I hit one last thing? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=236.0s)]
*  They were saying Hispanics are misogynistic. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=237.0s)]
*  Hispanic men are misogynistic. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=241.0s)]
*  Just for the record here, there have been 14 presidents who were females in Latin America. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=243.0s)]
*  So I don't think Latin American culture is misogynistic. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=250.0s)]
*  What it is is that they just are looking out to pay. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=254.0s)]
*  How do I pay for my family? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=258.0s)]
*  How do I support my family? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=260.0s)]
*  Or they believe that men can be men and women can be women in a traditional sense. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=261.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=264.0s)]
*  If that's misogynistic, then we got problems. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=265.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=268.0s)]
*  I do want to say this really quickly. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=269.0s)]
*  We got to go, but this is fascinating. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=271.0s)]
*  There are calls on the left for Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor to resign, to step down. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=272.0s)]
*  This has been great to see too. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=277.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=279.0s)]
*  Because. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=280.0s)]
*  How old is she? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=281.0s)]
*  She's 70. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=282.0s)]
*  70. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=283.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=284.0s)]
*  So that Joe Biden can appoint a Supreme Court Justice and the suggestion is Kamala Harris. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=285.0s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=289.0s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=290.0s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=291.0s)]
*  So there is no introspection. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=292.0s)]
*  If the result is she lost, but she should be. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=294.0s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=297.0s)]
*  No, that's, Steph, I don't think we're going to see much Kamala ever again. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=298.0s)]
*  No, I think Kamala's gone. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=302.0s)]
*  Only more, the only person more gone than Kamala is Tim Walz. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=304.0s)]
*  Tim Walz. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=308.0s)]
*  I was going to say Obama. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=309.0s)]
*  Obama has lost his mojo. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=310.0s)]
*  He's Barack Obama. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=312.0s)]
*  Tim Walz is the forgotten answer to a trivia question you will be asked in five years. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=313.0s)]
*  You will not be able to remember who was the running mate of Donald Trump's opponent in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=318.0s)]
*  2024. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=322.0s)]
*  But he was always a laughable, ridiculous figure. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=323.0s)]
*  Obama has truly lost. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=326.0s)]
*  He is eating so much crow. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=328.0s)]
*  He has destroyed his kingmaker powers. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=330.0s)]
*  He's done for. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=334.0s)]
*  He's going to just go off into the sunset with the other guy they're blaming, which is George Clooney. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=335.0s)]
*  The two of them will be off on a yacht somewhere. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK0RLC8jlc&t=340.0s)]
