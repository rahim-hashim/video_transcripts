# Democrats fed up with own party after Trump win: 'Afraid' to speak out
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM)
*  Yeah, I think that if the president's gonna get anything done, he's gonna need both chambers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=0.0s)]
*  And if he loses a house, which he doesn't look at it like, nobody thinks he's gonna [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=6.0s)]
*  lose a house except for King Jeffries. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  But if they lose the house, they're just gonna just look to impeach. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=11.28s)]
*  Well, Ari Fleischer this morning was interviewing with Brian, talking to Brian, and he said, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=16.0s)]
*  we've learned in this election that who voted for Kamala, the uber wealthy, the college [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=20.32s)]
*  educated and the ones without religion. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=24.68s)]
*  And so you have to take a step back and say, okay, that's not everyone in our country. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=27.3s)]
*  Middle America does like God. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=32.54s)]
*  Middle America might not have gone to college, but they are wonderful people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=34.3s)]
*  They're God fearing people. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=38.66s)]
*  They're not deplorables. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=39.82s)]
*  They're not, what was the word, they're not garbage. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=41.14s)]
*  They're hardworking people that are trying to put food on the table for their family [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  and they can't afford the food in the grocery store. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=46.38s)]
*  So Democrats are now saying some of them are flipping out, losing their minds, cutting [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=48.7s)]
*  their hair, having like, you know, protests. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=53.86s)]
*  But you have a few Democrats like Congressman Seth Moulton, Democrat from Massachusetts [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=57.42s)]
*  or Maine, MA is Maine, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=62.42s)]
*  And he says this to the New York Times, Democrats spend way too much time trying not to offend [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=64.58s)]
*  anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=69.58s)]
*  I have two little girls. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=74.42s)]
*  I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formally male athlete. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=75.66s)]
*  As a Democrat, I'm supposed to be afraid to say that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=81.58s)]
*  Well the thing is, Angel, you talked about what they say the college educated and all [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=84.54s)]
*  these groups. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=90.14s)]
*  That's the lecture crowd. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=91.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=92.14s)]
*  If you notice, Obama, whether he was talking to black males or all the sargots they put [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=93.14s)]
*  on his head, it was all the people lecturing the American people instead of listening to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=97.9s)]
*  the concerns. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=103.26s)]
*  He was lecturing the black men. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=104.26s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=105.26s)]
*  And they said, you know what, we're going to do what we want to do. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=106.26s)]
*  But there were two seats in New York that flipped and we saw the commercials. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=107.62s)]
*  They ran as Donald Trump. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=111.46s)]
*  They both ran as strong on the border. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=112.61999999999999s)]
*  Tom Schuazi kept a seat that Santos screwed up. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=113.97999999999999s)]
*  And then you have, DS Pezzito was a strong candidate but he loses to Laura Gillan. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=117.46s)]
*  She ran as I'm strong on the border. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=121.69999999999999s)]
*  I'm for cutting taxes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=123.61999999999999s)]
*  I'm for small business. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=125.13999999999999s)]
*  And the same thing Casey tried to gain on McCormick the same way. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=126.66s)]
*  Look what Tom Schuazi said. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=129.7s)]
*  He said instead of saying how can people vote for Donald Trump, we should be asking why [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=132.14s)]
*  do people vote for Donald Trump? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=136.1s)]
*  What did he do right? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=138.06s)]
*  And what did we do wrong? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=139.45999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's a guy that wants to keep his seat. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=140.98s)]
*  And that's a guy that just wants to govern. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=143.3s)]
*  I mean, if I'm the Trump camp, I'm calling this guy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=144.66s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=147.02s)]
*  I need people to work with because I'm only going to have a five vote margin. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=148.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=151.06s)]
*  Because you're not going to vote for someone who doesn't represent you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=152.06s)]
*  You're the constituent. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=155.1s)]
*  They need to know who you are and what you like and what you're interested in. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=156.1s)]
*  The most under reported thing about Donald Trump is he's not a partisan. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=158.34s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=162.02s)]
*  He clashes with the party and the party establishment all the time about issues. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=163.02s)]
*  I mean, you think about during the campaign, there was a huge battle between him and some [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=168.14s)]
*  in the pro-life community because he said that he didn't want to do a national bend, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=172.78s)]
*  that he wanted to stay with the states. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=176.5s)]
*  And so there is room to compromise with the Democrats if they're willing to have the conversation. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=178.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=184.5s)]
*  Here's Dean Phillips yesterday. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=185.5s)]
*  Remember, he ran against President Biden, was vilified by his own party. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=186.5s)]
*  He did us in, he just did our show in New Hampshire. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=191.34s)]
*  He joined us yesterday. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=193.9s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=194.9s)]
*  I don't blame people for being frustrated. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=195.9s)]
*  A lot of my colleagues are wondering what the heck happened. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=197.78s)]
*  I get it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=200.06s)]
*  I've been around this country. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=201.06s)]
*  I've been listening to people for years share with me their concerns and their challenges. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=202.06s)]
*  And I don't know why Democrats have not learned the lesson of what really matters. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=207.38s)]
*  We got to listen. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=210.86s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, I think, hit it on the head. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=211.86s)]
*  We have lost touch with the core of America. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=214.06s)]
*  And that is showing through in a lot of our elections right now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=217.3s)]
*  And the next candidates that recognize that, that are willing to listen, ingratiate themselves [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=221.22s)]
*  with everyday people and are authentic, they're going to win. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=226.0s)]
*  And it doesn't matter their politics as much as it matters about their authenticity. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=229.96s)]
*  I think that's another lesson learned. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=233.48s)]
*  Last hour, we told you about Mike Bloomberg came out in an editorial yesterday and said, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=235.44s)]
*  we should have probably been more candid about the deterioration of Joe Biden. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=238.52s)]
*  He came out and said that on the Sunday shows a year ago and they eviscerated him. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=242.4s)]
*  Who is he? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=247.04s)]
*  A one term congressman. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=248.04s)]
*  You know what he is? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=249.04s)]
*  He is a very rich guy, self-made multimillionaire, lost his dad at a young age and established [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=250.04s)]
*  himself there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=255.68s)]
*  He actually hosted Joe Biden when he was in his prime and saw the deterioration. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=256.68s)]
*  He did what RFK did and taken on Joe Biden in New Hampshire. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=260.92s)]
*  You know what they did? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=264.76s)]
*  We're not going to do anything in New Hampshire. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=265.76s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=266.76s)]
*  We're going to meet in South Carolina. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=267.76s)]
*  But the Democrats have that bad, and I know this because I was a former Democrat. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=269.14s)]
*  Whenever you express concern with the party and say, hey, you're losing me right here, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=273.76s)]
*  they just kick you out. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=278.44s)]
*  They don't want to have the conversation. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=279.72s)]
*  It is their way or the highway, which is why that coalition went for Donald Trump. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=281.0s)]
*  I mean, you got RFK, you got Tulsi Gabbard, and you got all the other many former Democrats [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=285.88s)]
*  that decided to give Donald Trump a shot. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfvKck7FeWM&t=291.38s)]
