# Trump triggers emergency meeting in Europe: 'Status quo vs. disruption'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs)
*  So happening today, French President Emmanuel Macron is holding an emergency [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=0.0s)]
*  summit to discuss President Trump. At least seven key European allies along [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=4.84s)]
*  with NATO and European Union officials are expected to attend this hastily [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=10.52s)]
*  arranged meeting. They say it's not an emergency meeting but it certainly is [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=15.4s)]
*  hasty and impromptu. Alex Hogan is live in London with the latest. Alex. Hi, good [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=19.8s)]
*  morning. So as Trump's team holds these meetings with Russian [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  officials, European leaders are quickly scrambling to hold a meeting of their [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=29.08s)]
*  own on the war in Ukraine and it was French President Emmanuel Macron who [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=33.16s)]
*  called for this emergency meeting which will be taking place at Paris's Elieze [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=37.32s)]
*  Palace this afternoon. He's going to meet with the leaders of Germany, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=41.76s)]
*  Britain, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark as well as the NATO [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=45.32s)]
*  secure secretary general and the European Council president and the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=50.64s)]
*  European Commission president. They're going to tackle how to respond to the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=54.32s)]
*  fast moving pace of the Trump administration, something that came as a [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=57.8s)]
*  shock to many of these European leaders. Washington's shifting priorities, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=61.4s)]
*  efforts to bolster defense spending and the big question of sending troops to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=65.6s)]
*  Ukraine after a ceasefire. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in an op-ed [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=69.92s)]
*  indicated for the first time that the UK could send British peacekeeping troops [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=74.56s)]
*  to Ukraine writing in part, I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=79.56s)]
*  with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way but [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=83.8s)]
*  any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine's security is helping to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=87.48s)]
*  guarantee the security of our continent and the security of this country. He went [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=91.2s)]
*  on to say that it is only the US that can deter Putin from attacking again in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=95.88s)]
*  the future. His spokesperson for his office says that he will be meeting with [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=100.96s)]
*  Trump within the week and the prime minister also went on this morning to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=105.0s)]
*  say that this is a once in a generational change to the security and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=109.6s)]
*  strategy here in not only the UK but around the continent as well. That's [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=115.28s)]
*  right. And Alex, as the United Kingdom has said, you know, we would be [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  interested in perhaps sending troops as some sort of a peacekeeping force in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=124.97999999999999s)]
*  Ukraine. It sounds like that's putting pressure on the other European allies [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=130.6s)]
*  and partners to do the same. You know, okay, England's gonna do this many. Hey, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=136.08s)]
*  France, how about you? Absolutely. This is going to put pressure on all of the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  other European allies. We know there will be more meetings that followed this [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=145.16000000000003s)]
*  specific meeting. But in that letter in that op-ed that the prime minister [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=148.66000000000003s)]
*  wrote, he did make mention to say that, look, Trump has a point here. We need to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=152.44s)]
*  improve our security. We need to show the US that we really are making a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  change here. And he says that's exactly the message that he's going to bring to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=161.28s)]
*  Paris later today. Alex, thank you. Alex. Yeah, Keir Starmer in the UK and Trump [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=164.94s)]
*  actually get along quite well, which is interesting because Starmer's from the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=170.64s)]
*  left from the Labour Party. But you know, when I look at this and I think about [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=173.62s)]
*  it, I think back to my tenure and just in that short time, what the Trump [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=177.18s)]
*  administration did at Kosovo, Serbia, normalization of relations that was a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=181.02s)]
*  war start in the 1990s. They put to rest and then the Middle East peace deals [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=185.26s)]
*  first time in 25 years, Bahrain, Morocco, UAE. My point is the diplomacy that Trump [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=189.74s)]
*  engages in, it's strategic. He knows what he's doing. And if I'm Europe, I'm [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=195.70000000000002s)]
*  3500 miles away from this meeting going on with the United States and Russia. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=199.62s)]
*  I'm thinking to myself, he put to bed a lot of prior conflicts. He created [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=203.58s)]
*  relations between foes, between enemies. He could do it again. Let's give him a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=207.9s)]
*  chance. Well, I worry. The thing is, we continue to see this not just [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=212.82000000000002s)]
*  internationally, but here domestically. It is the status quo versus disruption. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=218.02s)]
*  And we have so many people that just want the status quo. For example, when it [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=223.26000000000002s)]
*  comes to this conflict, Putin is a bad guy, which we all agree with. He started [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=226.70000000000002s)]
*  this war and he should just leave. Okay, you can have that viewpoint, but nothing [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=230.18s)]
*  has changed with having that viewpoint. You can say Putin is responsible for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=234.86s)]
*  this, but we have to have a negotiation to see how we end this. And that's what [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=239.3s)]
*  the president is doing. Let's have communication. Let's talk about what we [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=244.14000000000001s)]
*  can get. We've already got an American hostage as a result of this negotiation. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=247.98s)]
*  People are saying that this was the first part of that big overall deal. And [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=251.78s)]
*  he's sending his people down on the ground to have conversation as well. What [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=255.82s)]
*  is so bad about that? Now, if the deal comes out and we don't like the deal, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=260.9s)]
*  criticize it then. But starting the negotiation, I think they're getting [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=264.3s)]
*  ahead of their skis. Well, and it comes down simply when it comes to Ukraine to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=269.09999999999997s)]
*  this. Donald Trump has made it very clear from the get-go that war never [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=272.98s)]
*  should have happened. And as soon as he's president, famously he said, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=277.1s)]
*  I'm going to try to finish it off within the first 24 hours. It's a little more [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=281.26000000000005s)]
*  complicated than that, as we all know. But it goes to show you that he's [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=285.42s)]
*  talking in a simple way that people understand. It's like, you're right, why [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=291.26000000000005s)]
*  are we devoting all that energy and all those billions and billions and billions [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=296.14000000000004s)]
*  of dollars to that war over that disputed territory, which, you know what, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=300.5s)]
*  Ukraine's going to wind up losing territory. We know that's going to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  happen. Ultimately, that's going to be part of the deal. Donald Trump, though, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=308.62s)]
*  last week, I think it was, he revealed that he was asking Ukraine, and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=312.62s)]
*  essentially this is another one of the way he negotiates, is he was asking [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=318.42s)]
*  Ukraine for a big chunk of their rare earth, the stuff we need. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=324.1s)]
*  Apparently, according to the Washington Post, Ukraine rejected that proposal, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=330.54s)]
*  but they're working on a counter proposal. So it may not be a gigantic [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=335.14s)]
*  amount of their rare earth stuff that we need with our technical stuff, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=340.06s)]
*  but it's going to, they're going to give us access to it where we can get it [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=343.21999999999997s)]
*  if we need it, because right now a lot of the stuff's in China and it's [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=347.97999999999996s)]
*  hard to get. Well, we've certainly given a lot to Ukraine. So I think this [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=351.3s)]
*  is the art of the deal and President Trump putting America first. You know, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=354.7s)]
*  at this meeting, you have, it's Michael Waltz, you have Marco Rubio, and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=358.18s)]
*  then you have Steve Witkoff. And I'd remind everyone, Steve Witkoff is the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=362.9s)]
*  one who negotiated that ceasefire deal before they even got into office. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=366.02s)]
*  So I would count on this team. KT McFarland had some great points on some [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=369.82s)]
*  of the hypocrisy that she's seen among Europeans. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=373.85999999999996s)]
*  President Trump has said his legacy is as a peacemaker. So what's he trying [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=377.5s)]
*  to do? He's trying to bring a rapid end to the Ukraine war. The Europeans, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=381.17999999999995s)]
*  and frankly, the Biden administration, for years has said, we can't have a [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=385.09999999999997s)]
*  negotiated solution to that Ukraine war because we can't trust Putin. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=389.06s)]
*  Therefore, let's not negotiate. Therefore, America, we expect you to shoulder [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=393.02s)]
*  the burden of any defense Ukraine is going to do. And for the British prime [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=398.02s)]
*  minister and the French president to be saying, look, America, you've got to do [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=401.78000000000003s)]
*  more. When they're not willing to do more, it's just the height of hypocrisy. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=406.22s)]
*  Yeah, when you simplify their foreign policies, they're essentially saying [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=410.98s)]
*  America, shut up, don't get involved, but we want your money. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=413.86s)]
*  And that's just not going to fly with this current commander in chief. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=418.65999999999997s)]
*  Also, the one thing that I think is missing this conversation, whether you're [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=422.7s)]
*  talking about this conflict between the Russians and the Ukrainians or Israel [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=425.94s)]
*  and Hamas, the president is always speaking about human life. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=431.5s)]
*  He always talks about these kids are dying. This shouldn't have never happened. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=435.62s)]
*  Let's stop the killing. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=440.94s)]
*  And I think when you start from that, bring the hostages home, when you start [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=442.54s)]
*  from that point, you get the American people's attention from that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=447.7s)]
*  Like, I don't want to fight about who's right and who's wrong here, but the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=451.90000000000003s)]
*  killing must stop. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=455.98s)]
*  Yeah, and he's made that you're exactly right. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=457.90000000000003s)]
*  That point in both conflicts. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=460.14s)]
*  I mean, when people were criticizing him on being pro-Israel, which we should, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=461.42s)]
*  that is our greatest ally in the Middle East. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=464.98s)]
*  He was also mentioning lives lost in Gaza. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=466.86s)]
*  He won a huge portion of the Muslim vote in this country because he gave voice to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=469.58s)]
*  both sides in the bloodshed and do not under any condition send our American [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=473.58s)]
*  treasures, our men and women abroad. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=478.58s)]
*  He's kept them out of foreign wars. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=481.02s)]
*  That's his track record. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWj0csrBccs&t=482.46s)]
