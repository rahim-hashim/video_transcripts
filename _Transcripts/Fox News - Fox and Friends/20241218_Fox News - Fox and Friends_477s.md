# Elon Musk sends message to Republicans: This should NOT pass
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4)
*  They were talking about the spending bill as being Christmas trees, but it's not an omnibus bill. That's one thing they did they avoided the omnibus bill [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=0.0s)]
*  But because they have such a slim majority in the house and they don't run the Senate [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=6.7s)]
*  They don't have the White House this spending bill that was just posted last night [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=10.64s)]
*  It's gonna be posted for 72 hours for people to examine. That's the rule. Yeah, it's about 1,500 pages about a hundred billion dollars for disaster relief [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=14.84s)]
*  You know the series of natural disasters that hit the South North Carolina, especially 30 billion in FEMA funding [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=22.64s)]
*  They say they're out of money 10 billion in economic assistance for farmers [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=28.86s)]
*  You heard the speaker Johnson saying they a lot of them are gonna go under a lot of it had to do with the policies [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=32.42s)]
*  They've been suffering under under this administration. The SBA loans are out [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=37.58s)]
*  They're gonna be refunded as restrictions on outbound investment outbound investment to China [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=41.82s)]
*  500 pages of health care provisions which which cut out the middleman that President Trump referred to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=47.82s)]
*  A few days ago in his press conference and calls for transparency of charges for key events in ticketing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=54.5s)]
*  That was a little the controversy with Taylor's stadium. Look at those top three [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=60.88s)]
*  So the speaker said that first one it's a hundred billion in disaster relief [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=65.7s)]
*  We know all these hurricanes have come through we saw what happened in North Carolina. They had to borrow all this money [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=69.0s)]
*  They had to get loans from the banks to pay for this disaster relief to help our families that needed it [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=73.7s)]
*  And so now that money has to be paid back and the third one down you see the 10 billion in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  Economic assistance for our farmers. He said that's all the food we eat. We have to help them out [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=82.78s)]
*  Right and and here's the thing Republicans a lot of conservative Republicans hate the fact that the government is gonna spend so much money [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=86.82000000000001s)]
*  It's a dire situation because our federal government runs out of money at midnight on Friday [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=94.18s)]
*  And so essentially what they're gonna do is they're gonna pass this this 90-day [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=98.74000000000001s)]
*  They call it a patch but or it's kind of like a CER [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=105.78s)]
*  But what it's gonna do is gonna kick the can down to the middle of March [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=108.97999999999999s)]
*  So Donald Trump will be installed as president and then he'll be able to get running start before they have another big argument over [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=112.74s)]
*  You know the spending in Congress. Mr. Speaker who was with us a little while ago [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=119.3s)]
*  He's in trouble with a bunch of Republicans who he needs to have vote for him when he comes up for the speaker race [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=123.46s)]
*  He was with us a little while ago. We talked to him about a tweet that Elon Musk posted just a little while ago [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=130.57999999999998s)]
*  He's the one guy who could actually [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=137.54s)]
*  Out of his pocket fund a lot of the stuff [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=139.82s)]
*  Elon says this bill shall not pass and the speaker then reacted live on Fox and Friends with this [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=142.1s)]
*  Elon and Vivek and I are on a text chain together and I was explaining to them the background of this and the vacant [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=150.1s)]
*  I talked last night about almost midnight and he said look I get it. He said we understand you're in an impossible position [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=155.42s)]
*  Everybody knows that remember guys. We still have just a razor-thin margin of Republicans [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=161.34s)]
*  So any bill has to have Democrat votes they understand the situation. They said it's not directed to you, mr [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=165.98s)]
*  Speaker, but we don't like the spending I said, guess what fellas? I don't either we got to get this done because here's the key [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=171.1s)]
*  By doing this we are clearing the decks and we are setting up for Trump to come in roaring back with the America First agenda [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  That's what we're gonna run with gusto beginning January 3rd when we start the new Congress when Republicans again [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=183.62s)]
*  We're in control and all of our fiscal conservative friends [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=189.66s)]
*  I'm one of them will be able to finally do the things that we've been wanting to do for the last couple years [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=192.42s)]
*  the problem is Brian is [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=198.14s)]
*  You know people keep saying my in the speaker even alluded to it my conservative friends [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=200.94s)]
*  That's normally the debate with the Freedom Caucus. It's like they're put being pushed back [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=205.62s)]
*  But it's not just the conservative parts of the caucus doing it. It's the moderates as well [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=209.82s)]
*  I don't think I've witnessed a point when there was a CR or a [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=214.98s)]
*  Resolution put on the floor with both the moderates in the conservative both agree the only thing Lawrence [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=219.9s)]
*  I would say it's easier soon the sideline there when you finally realize just sit down roll your sleeves up and say I [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=224.82s)]
*  I just wonder why they can't even start working on this in September [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=229.54s)]
*  Yes [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=232.9s)]
*  Now but I think part of it is we think we're gonna win in November. You think you're gonna win in November [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=233.78s)]
*  Let's bet on each other. They bet on each other Democrats lose [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=238.42s)]
*  So now they have a situation where now get me to January 20th [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=241.7s)]
*  And now you're set tones till March the losers are Africa legislation to extend the African Growth and Opportunity Act [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=246.06s)]
*  Which in one way I could make a case for because China is making huge gains in Africa pharmacy benefit managers [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  They lost big on provisions to redirect spending on prescription drugs to health care plans and pharmaceutical companies Trump called them the middlemen [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=258.38s)]
*  They said they're making way too much money and they do way too little and the losers are Maryland [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=265.7s)]
*  You're about to lose the Redskins [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=270.02s)]
*  But guess what your stadium sucks and you should go right back to Washington DC [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=271.38s)]
*  So they're gonna go back to the RFK Stadium site just to the east of the Capitol [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=276.5s)]
*  The only way Mike Johnson the Republican will be able to pass this is he's gonna need dozens of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=280.82s)]
*  Democrats to actually vote with him and he'll probably get him [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=286.7s)]
*  But I'll tell you what when I think about the fact that Elon Musk tweeted this bill should not pass [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=289.5s)]
*  You know what? Haven't really heard from the President United States about this particular issue [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=295.46s)]
*  We president or president-elect president-elect [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=300.64s)]
*  We haven't heard from Donald Trump exactly. I mean if Elon Musk is saying don't do it. What's Donald Trump? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=303.8s)]
*  I don't do it. The government shuts down. He's just saying is Elon saying let the government shut down then he's got that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=309.4s)]
*  I think that I think the president-elect should stay out of that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=315.44s)]
*  I don't think he should get involved. He should wait until he's into power [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=317.88s)]
*  But I feel like we continue to lose as a country [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=321.48s)]
*  Maybe I'm a traditionalist [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=325.2s)]
*  But the fact that we don't have the 12 Appropriations bills out there to set up a budget to do this like go through the process [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=326.36s)]
*  Brian is talking about them waiting to the end. It's because they don't pass the bills [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=333.24s)]
*  They don't go through the regular order process [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  So each people can debate which line items they submitted and then we get a final budget put together at the very end [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=339.96s)]
*  They just continue to put everything on one. Well when Republicans once like when they are over the house and the Senate [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  Starting in January then they need to start working on the bill. This is probably gonna pass. This is probably gonna pass [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=353.86s)]
*  I don't think I don't think ever in our my time on Fox and Friends. We've had this discussion over and over that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=359.5s)]
*  Midnight, that's the deadline [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=365.46000000000004s)]
*  And how was it and how is it resolved just in a few days they [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=375.06s)]
*  Government employees didn't get paid during that period just the central personnel [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  Certain things were closed down people still got their Social Security checks Medicare still work [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=383.74s)]
*  But it ground the government to a halt and the Republican Party ultimately paid I guarantee they'll pass it [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=388.74s)]
*  They want to go home for Christmas. They don't want to have to stay there. Well, that's why the Christmas that way [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=394.06s)]
*  But you know, but the thing is president he said to me I've been constant contact with President Trump [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=398.5s)]
*  So nothing should be surprising the president-elect right, but if Elon Musk is saying don't do it [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=402.98s)]
*  Is that a message from Donald Trump? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=408.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, the thing is is that look the president-elect and Elon Musk obviously have a close relationship [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=410.74s)]
*  But he doesn't do everything that Elon Musk suggests. I mean there's been a lot of cabinet picks as well [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=416.18s)]
*  I think Elon is coming from the standpoint [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=421.06s)]
*  He's gonna be running that commission with those right and he's saying this is not a great start [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=424.1s)]
*  He almost has to say that he's trying to cut and this is this is going against exactly [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=428.9s)]
*  This is adding one one one billion. Is that what the congressman said? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=433.9s)]
*  Is it one billion to the to the to the deficit? It's a gigantic number. Yeah, hold on. I have it right here [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=438.22s)]
*  Nobody could work on if he's frustrated [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=443.94s)]
*  He could build more tunnels for his boring company because he's making tunnels underneath cities to alleviate traffic [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=445.82s)]
*  They already have tunnels under the cap, right or he could work on SpaceX and work on that [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=450.66s)]
*  Rescue blow off some steam or he could work on putting those chips in brains that also might relax him [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=454.66s)]
*  Or he could work on star starling. Well, he's got a lot of things just to get away if he wants to get away from Doge [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=459.86s)]
*  I'm Steve juicy [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-8p3GFIZ4&t=465.90000000000003s)]
