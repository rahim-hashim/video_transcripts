# Piers Morgan: People have become 'completely demented' against Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg)
*  Vice President Cheney has been the most dangerous vice president we've had probably in American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=0.0s)]
*  history. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=6.72s)]
*  Vice President Cheney and Dick Cheney have endorsed you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=7.72s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=9.72s)]
*  I'm actually, I'm honored to have their endorsement. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=10.72s)]
*  Which one is it? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=14.56s)]
*  Despite once having views of the different views of the former vice president, Democrats [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=15.56s)]
*  are now embracing Dick Cheney's endorsement of Kamala Harris. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=23.2s)]
*  The host is Piers Morgan. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=24.32s)]
*  And since Piers Morgan joins us now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=25.32s)]
*  I mean, I thought this guy was a bad guy for the Democrats. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=27.4s)]
*  And all of a sudden they love him. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Not just a bad guy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=34.199999999999996s)]
*  This was Darth Cheney. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=35.62s)]
*  Remember? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=37.16s)]
*  They literally named him after the most evil villain in the history of Hollywood. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=38.16s)]
*  That was Dick Cheney to liberal Democrats. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=45.16s)]
*  And yet now, well, there's two strands to the hypocrisy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=48.04s)]
*  One, what is Dick Cheney doing? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=51.68s)]
*  the most progressive left-wing Democrat nominee in history. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=54.32s)]
*  That alone is utterly ridiculous. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=57.96s)]
*  And secondly, what is Kamala Harris doing? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=60.56s)]
*  Suddenly embracing him like this is some great honor given the way the liberal Democrats [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=63.36s)]
*  have talked about him for the last 30 years. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=68.06s)]
*  So every part of this is completely preposterous. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's all about his daughter and family. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=73.84s)]
*  Because Liz Cheney has made a true enemy of Donald Trump and he primaried her and she's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=76.64s)]
*  now out of politics. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=81.42s)]
*  But remember, Liz Cheney, before she endorsed Kamala Harris, said this in 2020 in a tweet. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=82.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris is a radical liberal who would raise taxes, take away guns and health insurance [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  and explode the size and power of the federal government. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  She wants to recreate America in the image of what's happening in the streets of Portland [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=94.63999999999999s)]
*  and Seattle. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=98.55999999999999s)]
*  We won't give her the chance. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=99.6s)]
*  I guess she hasn't really changed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=101.28s)]
*  So what changed, Pierce? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, she's now giving you the chance to wreck America in the way that she said she'd wreck [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  these other places, which again is completely hypocritical, utterly ridiculous. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=110.72s)]
*  And it goes to the heart of what I think is really going on here. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=115.72s)]
*  This is about Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=118.48s)]
*  You know, we've discussed this for many years. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=121.04s)]
*  People get so completely demented about Trump, as you see with Liz Cheney and now with Dick [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=123.58s)]
*  Cheney, that they will literally abrogate all their own principles so that they can [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=128.36s)]
*  do something which is other than support Trump. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=132.72s)]
*  And yet the polls show right now a really interesting thing about Trump. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=136.28s)]
*  The latest New York Times poll, not only is he ahead of the national poll by one percent, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=139.84s)]
*  but if you looked at the details quite closely, it showed that most voters now view Trump [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=144.12s)]
*  as being in the center. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=149.8s)]
*  They see Kamala Harris as being two out to the left, Trump in the center. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  And this is the moment that Dick Cheney has chosen to embrace Kamala Harris as officially [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  endorser. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  And it is indicative of a mindset of some people on the conservative side where they [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=164.8s)]
*  will literally do anything, even if it destroys their principles, to do anything but support [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=169.24s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  And I think that's ridiculous. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  Pierce, you're joining us from England. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  We saw Princess Kate yesterday in a video and we want in your comment. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=178.36s)]
*  Here's a little bit of what she said. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=183.12s)]
*  Doing what I can to stay cancer free is now my focus. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  Although I finished chemotherapy, my path to healing and full recovery is long and I [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=188.88s)]
*  must continue to take each day as it comes to all those who continue their own cancer [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=197.2s)]
*  journey. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  I remain with you side by side, hand in hand. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, Pierce, the good news, she's finished chemo, but we don't know what kind of cancer. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=208.28s)]
*  There are a lot of details we don't know. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=212.76s)]
*  But do the people of England want to know? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  I think that there's a respect for the fact that she's entitled not to tell us exactly [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=218.76s)]
*  what cancer it is. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=222.6s)]
*  I think what's extraordinary about this video, it's like a mini movie. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=224.0s)]
*  I don't know if you've watched the whole thing, but it's really remarkably done. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  It's very high production values, very moving, very powerful, very inspiring. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=230.4s)]
*  What I liked about it was that she made a point of saying, look, in the end, what this [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=235.64s)]
*  has done to me, it's made me realize what's important in life. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=240.24s)]
*  And it's not about the trinkets or the palaces or the servants or the riches that come with [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=244.44s)]
*  being a princess. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  It's about the ability to love, she said, and the ability to be loved. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  And that's what shines through in the video with her and her husband and her kids, is [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  this is a young woman who's gone through a real life changing experience this year. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=259.08s)]
*  We don't know how serious it's been, but we do know it's been serious enough to barely [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  do any public engagements. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  And she hasn't committed to any for the rest of the year. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=270.0s)]
*  So it's a young woman who's been through a very serious amount of cancers. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  Not over yet, it's not out of the woods. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=276.32s)]
*  But I think that I really admire the fact, you said, it doesn't matter how rich you [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=278.52s)]
*  are, it doesn't matter how successful or privileged you are, in the end, cancer is [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=282.76s)]
*  a great leveler. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=286.84s)]
*  And right at the end of the statement, she said, I want to reach out to everyone, everyone [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=287.84s)]
*  who's got cancer and say, I'm holding your hand, I'm on the journey with you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=292.52s)]
*  I thought that was really powerful. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=296.56s)]
*  Yeah, well put, Pierce. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=297.79999999999995s)]
*  Great review. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=299.47999999999996s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  Great seeing you. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m5Ar7aweg&t=302.47999999999996s)]
