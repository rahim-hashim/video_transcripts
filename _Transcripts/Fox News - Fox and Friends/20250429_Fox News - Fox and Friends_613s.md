# Truck drivers must speak English now, Trump declares
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao)
*  A major test in President Trump's first 100 days in office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=0.0s)]
*  A string of aviation incidents and close calls as the U.S. faces a critical shortage of air [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=3.36s)]
*  traffic controllers. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  And just yesterday, major delays at Newark Airport because of an equipment failure with [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=10.64s)]
*  a few controllers to handle the problem. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=15.56s)]
*  I was there. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=18.0s)]
*  It was real. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=19.0s)]
*  And they had to send people to different airports, too. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=20.0s)]
*  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, he's one of the few people this wasn't news to. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=22.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=26.52s)]
*  Because you live it every day. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=27.52s)]
*  Thanks for Newark yesterday, Sean. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=28.52s)]
*  This has been some of the most challenging 100 days for anybody, I would say, outside [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=31.0s)]
*  the President of the United States with your department. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=35.0s)]
*  I was going to fly to Newark and I'm like, I'm going to take Amtrak instead. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=36.92s)]
*  It was just happenstance. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  And then my Amtrak was delayed an hour as well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  So I couldn't win either way. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=42.8s)]
*  It is a problem. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=45.16s)]
*  And so we're starting to see some problems in the infrastructure of our air traffic control [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=46.16s)]
*  system. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=49.84s)]
*  And that's what you had yesterday at Newark. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=50.84s)]
*  And so we need to fix it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  The Congress has to help us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=55.08s)]
*  It's going to be billions of dollars. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=56.72s)]
*  But it's hard to get money for big projects like this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=58.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=61.56s)]
*  And so that's important. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=62.56s)]
*  We need more air traffic controllers. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  We're 3,000 controllers short. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=65.0s)]
*  And so right now we're working with the union. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=67.72s)]
*  So when they hit 25 years, they can retire. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=69.8s)]
*  Or if they hit 56, they can retire. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=72.2s)]
*  How do we encourage air traffic controllers to stay on a little bit longer, serve their [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=74.44s)]
*  country longer as we get more young people into the business? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  Have you made progress with those? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=81.44s)]
*  With the union? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=83.12s)]
*  Yeah, we're making progress. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=84.12s)]
*  We're having good conversations with them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=85.12s)]
*  So you do that, pay them a little more if they stay past the 25? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  We've got to offer them a good bonus, have them stay. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, in overall budgeting, it's a little bit of money. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=93.56s)]
*  But keep them happy, keep them in their seats. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=97.0s)]
*  And then we're resurgent air traffic controllers into the school. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  By the way, these problems, they've existed. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=102.64s)]
*  And you start to lift up the hood and you're like, why didn't anybody fix this? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  And you can't just quickly do it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=109.56s)]
*  It takes time to train people up. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=111.72s)]
*  So, Mr. Secretary, let's talk about some of the events that's happened, because I know [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=113.84s)]
*  we get the number all the time that it's actually safe to travel by airplane. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=117.08s)]
*  But we look at some of the incidents. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=122.4s)]
*  There's been 18 fatal events. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=123.76s)]
*  There's been 110 fatalities and notable events. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  There was a DCH crash, a PA medevac crash. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the list just goes on and on and on. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=135.56s)]
*  This is all in the last hundred days. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=137.52s)]
*  In the last hundred days. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=138.52s)]
*  I mean, a tough job for you, but the American people look at it and they're like, okay, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=139.52s)]
*  we're scared to travel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=143.52s)]
*  Yeah, you know, when we had East Palisades and the train derailment, all of a sudden [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=144.52s)]
*  there was all this reporting on train derailment. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=149.24s)]
*  Were the numbers up with train derailment or is the media reporting more on train derailment? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=151.28s)]
*  The media now covers it more. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  So the numbers of crashes or incidents with aircraft, they're not up. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=157.5s)]
*  It's been consistent over the last six, eight years. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=163.8s)]
*  But the media covers it more after DCA. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  But that doesn't mean, so here's the problem. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  I think Pete Buttigieg should have seen the cross traffic in at DCA. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=172.44s)]
*  That's Washington, DC, where he had helicopters and fixed wing aircraft coming in in the same [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=177.12s)]
*  places. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=181.44s)]
*  He should have seen that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=182.44s)]
*  There were near misses all the time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=183.44s)]
*  85 of them in the four years before. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=185.0s)]
*  You should have seen that was going to happen. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=186.96s)]
*  And so now I'm looking to say, what should I see? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  How could I prevent the next crash? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=192.46s)]
*  And that's why this, the infrastructure of air traffic control, the president loves the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=194.02s)]
*  Brand new state of the art gold plated, everything new. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=198.88s)]
*  You need a new system. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=203.12s)]
*  This goes back 25, 30 years. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=204.2s)]
*  Were you were using the oldest technology? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=206.24s)]
*  We want to hear from our audience, but really quickly, what's going on with the truck drivers? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=208.6s)]
*  You're making them all learn English now. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=212.16s)]
*  They have to. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=213.88s)]
*  What? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=214.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=215.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=216.88s)]
*  So by the way, the truck drivers, I get more feedback from truck drivers who are angry that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=217.88s)]
*  there's other truck drivers who don't speak English. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=224.16s)]
*  And so Barack Obama lowered the standard. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=225.76s)]
*  So you got to slap on the wrist if you didn't speak English, where before they would immobilize [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=228.78s)]
*  your vehicle. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  Your semi would get parked if you couldn't speak English. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  We're going to go back to the pre Obama era where if you can't speak English, but this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  is dangerous. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=239.72s)]
*  The reasons because they can't read the road signs, right? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=240.72s)]
*  Well, there's road signs or if you get stopped by law enforcement, you can't communicate. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  You can't. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  So so we're going back to the old standard. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  And again, it's going to make a road safer. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=249.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=250.92s)]
*  The president signed an executive order yesterday for that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=251.92s)]
*  Let's find out what the audience wants to ask Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=252.92s)]
*  and let's begin with Evan. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=256.68s)]
*  Hi, sir. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=257.68s)]
*  You know, I hear a lot about the challenges about what you're facing, but I want to ask [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=258.68s)]
*  you personally, what has been the major challenge that you've seen in your own words that you [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=264.16s)]
*  don't hear in the media? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=269.04s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=271.4s)]
*  So, um, first, first off, you have to build a team, right? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=272.4s)]
*  And you have to bring people in and every department deals with this and the president [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=276.08s)]
*  deals with it as well. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=279.5s)]
*  But you got to bring your team in. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=280.5s)]
*  We're bringing our team in and building a team as we have the DCA crash and then we [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=282.76s)]
*  have Alaska and then we have Toronto and then we have what happens in Philadelphia. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=286.52s)]
*  And so that's that's the challenge when you don't have a fully staffed team and you're [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  dealing with some of the crises. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  But I got to tell you, the joy of this is to work with President Trump to see how hard [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=295.55999999999995s)]
*  he works, the vision that he has, how fearless he is, whether it's I mean, it's not I think [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=301.32s)]
*  presidents over the last 30, 40 years should have dealt with trade in America. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=307.32s)]
*  They're all too afraid. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=311.76s)]
*  They're all afraid of markets, they're all afraid of their big business donors who give [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=312.76s)]
*  them millions of dollars. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=316.4s)]
*  Not Donald Trump. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=318.4s)]
*  He's like, I'm going to fix this for the American people. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=319.4s)]
*  And he takes on fights that most politicians don't. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=320.88s)]
*  They're the right fights, but they're politically afraid. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=324.0s)]
*  This president doesn't. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=326.76s)]
*  And it gives us a lot of grace to do the wonderful things that haven't been done in the past. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=327.76s)]
*  Well, Evan asked a great question. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=332.32s)]
*  Joe, you've got a question now. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=333.92s)]
*  Yeah, as I'm getting older, I realize I'm probably going to need a self-driving car [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=336.36s)]
*  at some point. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=341.52s)]
*  And I've been a little disappointed that I haven't seen much coordination in terms of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=343.88s)]
*  infrastructure to help make self-driving cars work better. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=349.32s)]
*  It seems like all the emphasis is on the self-driving car doing it all and not much on infrastructure [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  to support self-driving cars. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=361.09999999999997s)]
*  So I hear you. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=363.3s)]
*  So I think that sometimes you think of the Department of Transportation as we have the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=365.16s)]
*  orange vest on and the stop in slow signs, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=370.44s)]
*  This is the most innovative space. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=373.76000000000005s)]
*  I think we're the internet. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=375.16s)]
*  We're the iPhone in their era. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=376.56s)]
*  So we have, to your point, we have autonomous vehicles, Evatols, which are the Ubers in [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=378.36s)]
*  the air, and we have drone technology. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=384.52000000000004s)]
*  And what we're doing is crafting rules that maintain safety, right? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=386.92s)]
*  The technology has to be there to keep people safe. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=390.88s)]
*  We're crafting rules that are going to allow the innovators to continue to innovate and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=393.8s)]
*  expand but also do it safely. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=397.6s)]
*  I think the way people move and products move over the course of the next four years, ten [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=399.64s)]
*  years is going to fundamentally change. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  Brian is going to be taking an Uber in the air off the Fox building and going to JFK [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=406.8s)]
*  to get his next flight to his next book conference, which would be great, right? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=414.0s)]
*  That would be fantastic. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=418.04s)]
*  And Amazon packages, Walmart packages coming by drone and autonomous vehicles, that technology [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=420.04s)]
*  is evolving. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=425.24s)]
*  And by the way, if we don't do it here in America, China's going to do it. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=426.24s)]
*  China's going to develop it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=429.44s)]
*  We'll be using Chinese technology. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=430.68s)]
*  I want us to use American technology and employ American workers with this technology. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=432.68s)]
*  So this is a critical point and we're aggressively working on it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=437.48s)]
*  Or the Chinese just kind of will do it and China will steal it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=441.12s)]
*  That's the other thing they like to do. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=443.36s)]
*  Chris, you have something to ask the Secretary of Transportation. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=445.04s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=447.88s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Secretary. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=448.92s)]
*  Chris. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=449.92s)]
*  From one born and bred New Jersey into an adopted New Jersey. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=450.92s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=454.28s)]
*  So we were talking about DCA, but I'm going to call an audible because we talked about [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=455.28s)]
*  and you sort of answered my question. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=460.12s)]
*  So I want to ask you about the congestion pricing around here because it's been a major [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=462.4s)]
*  bug of it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=467.08s)]
*  What is your office planning to get that axed for good? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=469.64s)]
*  So for the rest of America, in New York City, there's a cordoned area and the governor [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=474.28s)]
*  We're in it right now. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=481.0s)]
*  Yeah, you live in it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=482.0s)]
*  So yeah, you came in here, you paid $9 to get into the city. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=483.0s)]
*  Everyone has to pay $9 to access this part of New York. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=487.76s)]
*  It's fundamentally unfair because if you're rich, you can pay the, if you're Brian Kilmeade, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=491.11999999999995s)]
*  you can pay the $9. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  But most Americans, if you're paying to go through the tunnel or over bridges and then [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=498.11999999999995s)]
*  you pay the $9. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=501.23999999999995s)]
*  14 on my bridge. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=503.0s)]
*  So people are getting priced out of driving into New York City. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=505.64s)]
*  We've never done this before in America. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  There's always a free pathway to get, you might have a toll road, but there's always [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=509.88s)]
*  a free pathway to go around the toll road. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=513.32s)]
*  This is the only time, the only way to get here is if you pay $9. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=515.28s)]
*  This is not the vision that the Congress had. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=519.48s)]
*  So we're fighting Mayor, or Governor Hockel to take this away. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=521.92s)]
*  It doesn't comply with the law. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=527.24s)]
*  The grant to do this project should have never been given. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=529.12s)]
*  And by the way, she wants to take people off the road. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=531.64s)]
*  And she's taxing people to do it, raising money for the subway system in New York. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=535.0s)]
*  But then to put people in the subway, the New York subway is dirty. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=539.1999999999999s)]
*  It's violent, it's criminal, it's unsafe. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=542.88s)]
*  People stand against the wall in the subway because they don't want to get pushed in front [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=545.36s)]
*  of the tracks. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=548.3199999999999s)]
*  So if you want to have people take the subway, make it clean. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  Make it safe. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=553.52s)]
*  But by the way, I like freedom. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=554.92s)]
*  Let me drive my car in if I want. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=556.52s)]
*  And so you have to win this. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=558.6s)]
*  It affects our firefighters, our police officers, the ones who live out on Long Island and have [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=560.6s)]
*  to drive into the city. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  It affects all the doorman, all the teachers that teach in this area. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=569.0400000000001s)]
*  It affects all the businesses in the area. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=572.32s)]
*  And so this is bad liberal policy. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=574.08s)]
*  Again, they say they care about middle income people, lower income people. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=576.2s)]
*  This is a policy for the elites because they can afford to pay. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=580.28s)]
*  And they're taking middle income and poor people off the roads. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=584.28s)]
*  We never envisioned that kind of system. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=587.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=588.84s)]
*  It's not working. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=589.84s)]
*  Keep fighting. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=590.84s)]
*  You better win this one. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=591.84s)]
*  And also thanks for rebuilding Penn Station and moving Madison Square Garden. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=592.84s)]
*  Oh, that's going to be beautiful. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=594.44s)]
*  Donald Trump, Penn Station, some great. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=595.44s)]
*  Thank you, Donald. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=596.44s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=597.44s)]
*  Great job. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=598.44s)]
*  Talk about doing a great job. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeoumeUn1ao&t=599.44s)]
