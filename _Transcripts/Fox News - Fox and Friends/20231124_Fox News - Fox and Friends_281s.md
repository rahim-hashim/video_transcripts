# Jack Keane: This would be a strategic defeat for Israel
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y)
*  Fox News alert now in less than two hours. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Thirteen families may finally be reunited with hostages held by Hamas terrorists as [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=4.0s)]
*  part of the deal of a four-day ceasefire, which is now in effect. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=9.64s)]
*  But not after intense fighting as Israel vows the war against brutal Hamas terrorists is [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=13.32s)]
*  far from over. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=18.76s)]
*  Fox News' senior strategic analyst, retired four-star general Jack Keane joins us now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=19.76s)]
*  General, you're obviously happy about the hostages getting out, but it's very, very [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=24.28s)]
*  troublesome time for Israel. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=30.32s)]
*  In what respect? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=32.44s)]
*  Yeah very much so. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=35.44s)]
*  Look, it's absolutely compelling, you know, for the national government to get these [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=36.44s)]
*  hostages back for all the obvious reasons. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=41.16s)]
*  And that will always be the case. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  But Hamas knew this from the outset. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=46.44s)]
*  This is the first time they've ever attacked civilians en masse, which they did on October [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=48.16s)]
*  the 7th, and the first time they've ever taken this number of hostages. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=53.24s)]
*  And why have they done that? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=56.6s)]
*  They've done that because at the end of the day they're going to use hostages to preserve [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  their regime and to preserve as much of their fighters and military infrastructure as possible. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=62.0s)]
*  And if they're able to achieve that, that will be a strategic defeat for Israel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  Despite all the physical destruction you see in northern Gaza and what will eventually [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=73.72s)]
*  take place, much of the war that Israel is fighting is ahead of them. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=79.42s)]
*  Hamas has delayed, not defended in northern Gaza. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=85.66s)]
*  Most of their leaders and troops have now moved to the south. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=89.34s)]
*  And certainly the ceasefires play to their advantage as well. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=92.78s)]
*  Don't want to get anybody confused here. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=98.06s)]
*  Getting the hostage out is a primary mission for the Israeli government and for our government [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=101.14s)]
*  as well, and it should always remain so. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=106.7s)]
*  But it does have its impact on the Israeli's military campaign, to be sure. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=109.5s)]
*  We estimate that of the 25,000 Hamas fighters that they have, they probably have somewhere [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  a little south of 20,000 still left because they're doing everything they can to preserve [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=122.0s)]
*  that force. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=127.86000000000001s)]
*  So there's much ahead for the Israelis if the mission will stay the same, which I think [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=128.86s)]
*  it should, to dismantle the Hamas terrorist and military network and change the government [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=134.06s)]
*  out. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=139.3s)]
*  They are moving south. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=140.3s)]
*  That's one thing that's pretty clear. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=141.3s)]
*  They made it known they're going to start moving south, and they have to. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=142.3s)]
*  From what you can ascertain, General, is there a way for Hamas to get replenished, re-armed, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=146.02s)]
*  to sneak out, to get out of the country? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=152.9s)]
*  Or get out of Gaza? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=157.34s)]
*  Well certainly there's ways for them to get out if they truly want to get out. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=158.82s)]
*  But that's not who they are. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=165.06s)]
*  I mean, we've got to understand who these guys are. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=166.54s)]
*  This isn't about getting away. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=169.18s)]
*  This is about killing as many Israelis as they possibly can. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=170.46s)]
*  They want to hand the Israelis a strategic defeat to weaken Israel and to weaken the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=174.54s)]
*  government so much so that that government will likely have to change. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=180.26s)]
*  We've already won a propaganda information war victory with the widespread international [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=183.94s)]
*  condemnation of Israel because of the violence of the operation taking place against Hamas, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  and they're holding the population in place. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=196.54s)]
*  Once again, so our audience understands, the only precedent, this is completely precedent [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=199.02s)]
*  breaking, urban warfare is normally fought where most of the people are gone just prior [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=205.18s)]
*  to the artillery arriving and certainly the troops. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=211.01999999999998s)]
*  This is unprecedented to have this many tens of thousands of people still in residence [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=214.94s)]
*  and the war is taking place in their neighborhood. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=221.54s)]
*  And Hamas has created that as an objective to get the kind of international widespread [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=225.5s)]
*  condemnation that they have achieved because of the civilians that are being killed and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  they are the cause of it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=237.1s)]
*  It's really diabolical, sinister on a part of supposedly the government of Gaza who they [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=238.76s)]
*  represent and not only, not protecting their people, serving their people up as casualties. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=245.84s)]
*  And that's absolutely outrageous. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=254.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=255.48s)]
*  The question is, after those five days, if they say, how would you like another 13, does [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=256.48s)]
*  Netanyahu says, forget it, we're fighting again? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=260.32s)]
*  Or does he say, give me the 13? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=263.0s)]
*  I got you another 10. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=265.2s)]
*  I got you another 10. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=266.2s)]
*  And the longer it drags out, it's going to be hard to get back on that war footing because [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=267.74s)]
*  of public opinion. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=271.32s)]
*  And that's where we're at right now. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=273.24s)]
*  So fascinating time, General. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=274.52s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=276.56s)]
*  Yeah, great. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=277.56s)]
*  You guys have a wonderful Thanksgiving weekend. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms25jQ8p-Y&t=278.56s)]
