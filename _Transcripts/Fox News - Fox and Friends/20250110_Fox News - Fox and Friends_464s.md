# 'He lied!': Hosts react to Newsom being confronted by anguished mom
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8)
*  Listen to this woman confront Governor Newsom. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=0.0s)]
*  Governor, I live here, Governor. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=5.0s)]
*  That was my daughter's school, Governor. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=7.0s)]
*  Please tell me what you're going to do. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=9.0s)]
*  I'm not going to hurt her. I promise. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=10.0s)]
*  I'm literally talking to the president right now [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=12.0s)]
*  to specifically answer the question of what we can do for you and your daughter. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=14.0s)]
*  Can I hear it? Can I hear your call? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=19.0s)]
*  Because I don't believe it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=21.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. There's literally, I've tried five times. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=23.0s)]
*  That's why I'm walking around to make the call. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=26.0s)]
*  Why is the president not taking your call? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=28.0s)]
*  Because it's not going through. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=30.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=32.0s)]
*  So let's get it. Let's get it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=33.0s)]
*  I want to be here when you call the president. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=34.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. I'm doing that right now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=36.0s)]
*  Everyone who went to school there, they lost their homes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=38.0s)]
*  They lost two homes because they were living in one building another. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=42.0s)]
*  Why was there no water in the hydrants, Governor? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=45.0s)]
*  That's all literally being... [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=48.0s)]
*  Is it going to be different next time? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=50.0s)]
*  It has to be. It has to be. Of course. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=51.0s)]
*  Did you hear at the beginning of that soundbite, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=54.0s)]
*  he said, I'm literally talking to the president right now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=57.0s)]
*  He lied. He just lied. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=60.0s)]
*  He just told that woman, that woman is talking about, that's her kid's school. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=61.0s)]
*  They've lost everything at the school. The school is gone. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=65.0s)]
*  And she is in distress. And what does he do? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=67.0s)]
*  He lies to her. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=70.0s)]
*  Just flat out lies. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=71.0s)]
*  How many people has he lied to this week? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=72.0s)]
*  He lies all the time. That's the whole thing with him. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=74.0s)]
*  And when you look at, Brian is so right about all of these progressive states and cities. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=77.0s)]
*  You even go all the way to New Orleans and see what the mayor did. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=83.0s)]
*  You don't know the different assets that you have to protect the sidewalk. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=87.0s)]
*  That's what's happening in California. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=91.0s)]
*  And the Republicans have to take this moment as an opportunity to show effectiveness. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=93.0s)]
*  I think Ron DeSantis, the governor of Virginia, should go to California. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=98.0s)]
*  Governor Beshear of Kentucky. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=106.0s)]
*  And show them how it's done. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=107.0s)]
*  Bring your resources there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=109.0s)]
*  We heard the president of the United States talking about generators. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=111.0s)]
*  Why didn't you all have generators already staged? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=114.0s)]
*  You need them. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=118.0s)]
*  The military planes, okay. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=119.0s)]
*  Brian brought up an interesting point yesterday about them flying through the smoke. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=121.0s)]
*  They're just now getting the military planes there. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=124.0s)]
*  Why didn't you all have those pre-staged? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=127.0s)]
*  And then Ainsley, we can't leave out that the mayor wasn't there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=130.0s)]
*  Well, exactly. And all these celebrities are now speaking out. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=134.0s)]
*  That lady, that frustrated lady was on with Jesse last night. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=137.0s)]
*  And Jason Bateman's sister, what's her first name? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=140.0s)]
*  Justine Bateman was on. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=143.0s)]
*  And she was so frustrated too. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=144.0s)]
*  And this is James Wood. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=146.0s)]
*  Because remember, President Biden said he blamed this on climate change. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=147.0s)]
*  James Wood says this fire is not from climate change, you ignorant blank hole. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=152.0s)]
*  It's because liberal idiots like you elect liberal idiots like Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=157.0s)]
*  One doesn't understand the first thing about fire management. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=163.0s)]
*  And the other can't fill the water reserves. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=166.0s)]
*  Well, across the board, there's been a failure to figure out, to pre-plan, to pre-position. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=169.0s)]
*  Karen Bass, the mayor out there, she declared a state of emergency and then she flew to Ghana. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=175.0s)]
*  And it's like, okay, there's going to be something that's going to change the arc of this city forever. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=181.0s)]
*  And what is she at? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=189.0s)]
*  She's at a ceremonial inauguration. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=190.0s)]
*  From start to finish, all the way from the local neighborhoods right up to the top guy, Joe Biden. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=192.0s)]
*  They've got to figure out what went wrong. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=198.0s)]
*  The mayor does not like being pressed. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=200.0s)]
*  Why wasn't there water? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=203.0s)]
*  Why didn't you pre-plan? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=205.0s)]
*  Why did you cut the budget? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=207.0s)]
*  That's a little bit of what went on yesterday out in the City of Angels that was angry at her. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=209.0s)]
*  We're almost 48 hours after this fire started. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=216.0s)]
*  There's not resources up there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=220.0s)]
*  The hydrants aren't working. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=221.0s)]
*  Where's the National Guard? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=223.0s)]
*  Where are miles and miles of water tenders? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=225.0s)]
*  How are we addressing this? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=227.0s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=229.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, you asked me, was I frustrated by this? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=230.0s)]
*  Of course, because we all know that this has been an unprecedented event. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=232.0s)]
*  We also know that fire hydrants are not constructed to deal with this type of massive devastation. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=238.0s)]
*  And that the number one problem, especially on Tuesday, I mean on Wednesday, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=245.0s)]
*  was the fact that we weren't able to do the air support because of the winds. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=251.0s)]
*  And so, of course, I am absolutely frustrated by that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=257.0s)]
*  I am not sure that is correct that there are no resources up there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=260.0s)]
*  But rest assured, as soon as we are done here, I will follow up on that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=264.0s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=269.0s)]
*  I'm wondering how many flights were grounded because President Biden was going to Los Angeles to visit his great granddaughter. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=270.0s)]
*  So that has to be investigated, too. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=277.0s)]
*  Did you clear out the airspace that could have been used? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=280.0s)]
*  How did the president get in? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=282.0s)]
*  Here's the thing, too. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=284.0s)]
*  We learned a lot after Katrina, right? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=285.0s)]
*  Yeah, we did. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=287.0s)]
*  When you had that hurricane that went into North Carolina, no one was expecting that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=288.0s)]
*  But in California, you do expect wildfires. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=291.0s)]
*  They happen all the time. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=294.0s)]
*  So when you're the mayor, you would think you would have the proper tanks. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=295.0s)]
*  The tanks would be filled to the brim. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=299.0s)]
*  They're saying they were, but are they? Were they? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=302.0s)]
*  They didn't have enough. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=304.0s)]
*  They didn't have enough. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=305.0s)]
*  So you build more. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=306.0s)]
*  It's just like what happens in New Orleans. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=307.0s)]
*  After the hurricane came through, they built up the levee system. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=309.0s)]
*  They fixed it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=312.0s)]
*  They tried it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=313.0s)]
*  Well, she also said that the hydrants weren't properly staged in the way that could sustain a fire like this. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=314.0s)]
*  You're in California. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=322.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't you have that universally in the state if you're at risk? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=323.0s)]
*  I know that this is different from L.A. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=329.0s)]
*  They haven't experienced anything like this in L.A. before. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=331.0s)]
*  But there's always the risk, which is why the people try to get the insurance as a result of that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=334.0s)]
*  But yet we can name four major fires right in that area. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=339.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=342.0s)]
*  Here's one question. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=343.0s)]
*  When you have your emergency management meetings, you know, we're in your windbreakers. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=345.0s)]
*  If there's a fire that goes through five counties, would we be able to fight it? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=349.0s)]
*  And if the answer obviously is no, that's not good enough. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=353.0s)]
*  Now, the police chief there tried to give her some cover in the press conference. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=358.0s)]
*  But there's a memo of the police chief at the time saying, look, this is going to hurt us. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=363.0s)]
*  We don't have the proper resources. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=370.0s)]
*  Guys, we heard some reports from firemen. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=372.0s)]
*  Let's take the water out of it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=374.0s)]
*  Firemen didn't even have the proper equipment. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=376.0s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=379.0s)]
*  How do you explain that? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=380.0s)]
*  That firemen didn't have the proper equipment? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=382.0s)]
*  Because their budget was cut. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=384.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=385.0s)]
*  $17 million. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=386.0s)]
*  And remember the L.A. Times. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=387.0s)]
*  The L.A. Times, historically a left leaning newspaper, wrote on X last night, fires in L.A. are sadly no surprise. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=388.0s)]
*  Yet the mayor led the L.A. fire department, cut the L.A. fire department budget by $23 million. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=395.0s)]
*  OK, so when we think if there are budget cuts, what do you think? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=402.0s)]
*  OK, not as many trucks. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=405.0s)]
*  No, it's across the board. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=407.0s)]
*  They can't afford to hire enough mechanics. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=408.0s)]
*  They've got yards full of fire trucks and fire engines that cannot leave the field because they don't work. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=411.0s)]
*  They need mechanics. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=418.0s)]
*  It's from start to finish. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=419.0s)]
*  And what have we heard from California? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=421.0s)]
*  You know, from this couch we have reported about all the crazy super liberal policies over the last couple of decades. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=423.0s)]
*  And over the last couple of months since the election, what has California been doing? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=430.0s)]
*  They've been trying to Trump-proof California. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=434.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=437.0s)]
*  They should have fire-proofed it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=438.0s)]
*  And what they should have done is they should have planned for a really big fire because it happened this week. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=439.0s)]
*  No, they're focused on these DEI recruitment videos that focus on that when they should have been focusing on the things to keep people safe. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWkr8ZktbL8&t=444.0s)]
