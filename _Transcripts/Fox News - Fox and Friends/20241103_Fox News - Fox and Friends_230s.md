# Independent voters are not ‘buying’ Harris’ response to Biden’s ‘garbage’ remark
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk)
*  Well, as we enter the final days of the campaign, an awful lot has been said in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=0.0s)]
*  the past week by the candidates and those connected to them. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=4.16s)]
*  But how are the voters feeling about those comments here with the dials, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  pollster and Maslansky and partners, President Lee Carter. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=11.16s)]
*  Hey, Lee. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=14.6s)]
*  Hey, great to see you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=16.88s)]
*  Good morning. Great to see you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=17.8s)]
*  Yeah, we're curious about what the voters are saying about Joe Biden's garbage [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=18.84s)]
*  comment. Listen to this sound bite and then we'll talk to you on the other side. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=23.16s)]
*  A speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=26.4s)]
*  Well, let me tell you something. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=32.76s)]
*  I don't I don't know the Puerto Rican that I know or Puerto Rico, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=34.199999999999996s)]
*  where I'm in my home state of Delaware. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=39.12s)]
*  They're good, decent, honorable people. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=41.64s)]
*  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  His his his demonization is seen as unconscionable. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  Oh, Lee. Wow. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=51.28s)]
*  You can see that independents and Republicans didn't like it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=52.96s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=56.4s)]
*  They gave it a D and an F respectively, while in the well, well, well, Democrats [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=58.4s)]
*  gave it a B. And this is what's most surprising to me, because so many people [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=62.4s)]
*  are trying to say this was a gaffe on him. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=65.32s)]
*  This was only him. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=67.6s)]
*  Democrats agree. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=69.0s)]
*  We are so divided. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=70.48s)]
*  They are looking at Trump supporters with judgment and they didn't mind that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=71.88s)]
*  comment all that much. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=75.2s)]
*  So they they you can see they didn't dial it down in the comments. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  Many people said that they agreed with him. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=80.36s)]
*  And I was really surprised to see that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=82.64s)]
*  All right. I'm curious to see how the voters reacted to Kamala Harris's response [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=84.64s)]
*  to Biden's garbage comment. Watch this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  First of all, he clarified his comments, but let me be clear, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=92.44s)]
*  I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  As you heard in my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=104.16s)]
*  Lee. Yeah. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  So you can see there, Republicans and Democrats, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, Republicans and independents just were not buying what she had to say there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=117.16s)]
*  Democrats did. But she has a unity message. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=120.52s)]
*  When she's responding to this and trying to apologize for it, distance herself from it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=124.36s)]
*  She needs it needs to resonate. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=128.16s)]
*  It did not resonate with people that she really needed it to resonate with, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=129.48s)]
*  especially independents who are very, very turned off by all of the negative rhetoric. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=133.2s)]
*  All right. Here's Donald Trump in North Carolina at a rally there. Watch this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=137.72s)]
*  I'd like to ask you one very simple, easy to answer question. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=142.88s)]
*  Are you better off now than you were four years ago? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=149.44s)]
*  I'm here today with a message of hope for all Americans. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=156.32s)]
*  Lee, those independents, they like that message. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=160.84s)]
*  They sure did. You can see there, Republicans gave an A, independents a B. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=164.72s)]
*  Democrats didn't tune in too much. They gave it an F. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=169.04s)]
*  But the thing that's so important, we're talking about these independent voters. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  They are dialing in to this message and they know that they were better off four years ago. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=175.2s)]
*  This is one of Donald Trump's best messages. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=180.2s)]
*  And the other thing I will say about independents is I had tested all kinds of messages [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=182.92s)]
*  from the media calling Republicans, Nazis, all these other kind of comments. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  Independents are completely turned off by that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  They say enough is enough with that rhetoric. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=194.64s)]
*  And it actually is sticking to Kamala Harris. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=196.83999999999997s)]
*  And so that last segment that you had talking about the impact of the Democratic rhetoric on this election, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=199.12s)]
*  I think it's absolutely right. It's turning a lot of people off and it's getting in the way of Kamala's unity message and that argument. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  So Donald Trump doing very well when he focused on the economy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=210.0s)]
*  Are you better off today than you were four years ago? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=213.16000000000003s)]
*  And you're seeing independents line up with him. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=215.44s)]
*  Very interesting. Thank you so much, Lee. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uACKUPDqbxk&t=217.24s)]
