# This is a 'masterclass' in campaigning: Rachel Campos-Duffy
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM)
*  And you mentioned 2016, it feels a lot like 2016 energy right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=0.0s)]
*  And some people in the media are pointing out what Kamala Harris is doing, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=4.84s)]
*  rallies with Bruce Springsteen and Beyonce. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=9.68s)]
*  Big celebrities in these highly curated events. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=13.36s)]
*  Looks a lot like what Hillary Clinton was doing at the end of her race in 2016. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=16.84s)]
*  Whereas Donald Trump, for example, is working at McDonald's and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  talking to pointing out a contrast with his opponent in that trip. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=26.44s)]
*  But also appealing to a lot of people in a viral way. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  And then also going on Joe Rogan, the Joe Rogan experience, a full three hours late [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=34.04s)]
*  last night it was released. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=38.24s)]
*  And as part of that, he talked about his shift at McDonald's. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Here's Trump. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=44.24s)]
*  So I did McDonald's last week. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=47.64s)]
*  I saw that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  And I actually got a call from your friends at Google, from Sundar. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=50.540000000000006s)]
*  That's pretty good, right? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=54.0s)]
*  He said, this is the biggest thing we've had in years. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=55.4s)]
*  You at McDonald's? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  At McDonald's. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=60.12s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=60.72s)]
*  It was one of the- [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  It was funny. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=62.24s)]
*  Who's a great guy, by the way. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=63.72s)]
*  But he said, this McDonald's thing, I want to tell you, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=64.8s)]
*  it's one of the biggest things we've ever had on Google. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=68.0s)]
*  It just hit. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=71.08s)]
*  But the reason I did it, and I actually, you never know about this stuff. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=72.2s)]
*  I thought it was a throw away. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=75.28s)]
*  I didn't think our conversation was a throw away. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=77.08s)]
*  But I thought I'd walk in, and that was only to highlight the fact. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  I have a friend, he owns like 56 of these McDonald's. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=83.0s)]
*  He said, do you want to use one? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  I said, yeah, I love it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=87.72s)]
*  So we went there, and the crowd was crazy. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=89.0s)]
*  They had 28,000 people around, the whole thing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  Did you see the outside? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=94.0s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  The cars couldn't get through. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=95.96s)]
*  Secret Service was not exactly thrilled. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=97.36s)]
*  We had no idea what the hell. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=99.32s)]
*  But I went into the place, and I did the French fry thing. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=100.72s)]
*  And it just hit. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  This was a master class in campaigning, by the way, you guys. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  What he did with McDonald's, and understanding why he did it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=110.56s)]
*  Because the press refused to look into her background, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=114.72s)]
*  which was obvious that there are no photos of her working at McDonald's. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=119.08s)]
*  There are no other employees who can say they worked with her. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=123.56s)]
*  There's no pay stubs. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  McDonald's has been oddly silent about a celebrity person who worked at [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=129.72s)]
*  their franchise because they love to advertise how many people. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=134.84s)]
*  I think one in eight Americans have worked at McDonald's. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=139.68s)]
*  That's how many people. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=142.6s)]
*  They love saying famous and successful people worked at their store. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=143.48s)]
*  It was obvious she was lying. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=148.48s)]
*  And he was so mad that he gets scrutinized for every little thing he does. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=149.8s)]
*  And this was her lying, again, stolen Valor. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=155.24s)]
*  McValor, stolen McValor. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=160.44s)]
*  And he brought attention to it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=162.04s)]
*  The media didn't want to cover it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  The people writing the news stories didn't want to cover it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  But the people understood this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=172.72s)]
*  It was a perfect moment, politically speaking. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=174.44s)]
*  It's fascinating he talked about how big this was in Internet search engines, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=177.76s)]
*  in Google terms. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=182.28s)]
*  It's a reflection of how this type of politicking matters in 2024. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=184.44s)]
*  What has mattered throughout our history often is what newspapers choose to do, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  who they choose to endorse. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=194.2s)]
*  I always wonder how much that really has mattered. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=195.16s)]
*  But yes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=197.24s)]
*  In the past, I think you could argue that an editorial board's decision to endorse [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=197.96s)]
*  a president or not mattered. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  I think we can all agree that it doesn't matter to the average American. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=204.24s)]
*  But it does matter to the candidates. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=208.44s)]
*  It does matter specifically to Democrat candidates, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=210.12s)]
*  specifically if you don't get the endorsement. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=213.52s)]
*  For example- It's a given right now. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=216.56s)]
*  If you're a major newspaper, your endorsement's going to a Democrat. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  For example, from the Washington Post. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=221.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=224.0s)]
*  Just late this week, they will not endorse a candidate for president. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=224.56s)]
*  Now this follows the Los Angeles Times, who also made a similar decision. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=228.44s)]
*  And Pete, you pointed out the Minneapolis Star Tribune. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=235.56s)]
*  Home newspaper of Tim Walz. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  Super Lib. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=238.0s)]
*  I mean, the Red Star, my dad called it growing up. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=238.8s)]
*  Will not endorse a candidate for president. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=240.96s)]
*  And I looked back, they endorsed in 20, in 16, in 12, in 8, in 4, and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  2,000, all Democrats. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  And that's par for the course. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=251.16000000000003s)]
*  Take a look at what this has been over the past. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=252.36s)]
*  We'll just go the last three election cycles. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=254.44s)]
*  In 2016, Hillary Clinton got 240 newspaper endorsements, Donald Trump, 20. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=256.4s)]
*  In 2020, the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, basically halved that, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=263.88s)]
*  his total halved, 120 endorsements, Trump 14. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=267.96s)]
*  Now here we are in 2014, and it's been reduced another 60% or so. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=271.96s)]
*  Harris-Waltz, 80 endorsements, Trump less than 10. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=277.28s)]
*  I mean, the story there is all of these newspapers who were bank shot, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=282.64s)]
*  slam dunk, guaranteed endorsements for Democrats, for some reason or another, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=287.24s)]
*  going, we're not gonna endorse Kamala Harris. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=291.84s)]
*  I think it's two-fold, right? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=293.64s)]
*  They're making a bet and saying Kamala Harris is a horrible candidate, and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  we don't wanna be saddled with that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=299.2s)]
*  It's also in many ways a dying business. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=301.32s)]
*  And they've offended their readership time and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=304.32s)]
*  time again by misrepresenting who they are and going in the tank for Democrats. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=306.56s)]
*  And it's bad business to endorse. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=310.84s)]
*  This is a full on freak out at the Washington Post. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=313.32s)]
*  That's the story. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=316.12s)]
*  It's a full on meltdown. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=316.96s)]
*  Because if democracy dies in darkness and [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  Hitler is running, then you better endorse. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=321.44s)]
*  You need to, and they didn't. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=323.96s)]
*  And Bezos basically, I guess the word is Bezos said we're not doing any more [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  endorsements. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=329.0s)]
*  But suddenly now is their time. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=329.88s)]
*  I think the real story is, again, it's Donald Trump. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=331.91999999999996s)]
*  There is no single figure more responsible for [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  how unimportant newspapers have become and legacy media has become than Donald Trump. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=340.44s)]
*  Fake news, the idea of fake news and introducing that idea and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=347.32s)]
*  exposing the media just like he did with McDonald's. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=351.96s)]
*  You don't wanna cover the story? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=354.64s)]
*  Well, okay, I'll go to McDonald's and I'll make the point to the people myself. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=356.12s)]
*  You don't wanna tell the story, I'll tweet it out. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  You take me off Twitter, I'll start another media company. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPPvzI6YIM&t=362.71999999999997s)]
