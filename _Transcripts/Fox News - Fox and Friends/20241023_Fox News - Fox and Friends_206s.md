# Obama-voting autoworker: Dems' 'fake optics don't work anymore'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY)
*  So more rank and file Michigan auto workers breaking with their union in the crucial swing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=0.0s)]
*  state after United Auto Workers Union endorsed Kamala Harris for president. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=5.72s)]
*  Our next guest was a Democrat his whole life, but he will cast his vote for Donald Trump [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=10.58s)]
*  this election. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=14.9s)]
*  Michigan auto worker and active UAW member James Benson Jr. joins us now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=16.32s)]
*  Sir, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=21.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=25.48s)]
*  James, you know this this clip from this auto worker in Michigan really caught my surprise [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=26.56s)]
*  and I was just wondering if you feel the same way. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=32.52s)]
*  This is what he had to say. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=35.16s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=36.16s)]
*  Knowles is a union auto worker, one of 1100 just laid off by Stellantis, the parent company [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=37.16s)]
*  of Chrysler Jeep. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=43.28s)]
*  He blames corporate greed the most, but doesn't stop there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=44.68s)]
*  The second blame, I will put it on Joe Biden and the Democratic Party. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=48.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=54.24s)]
*  Because of the EV mandates. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=55.24s)]
*  I thought the Democratic Party was for the working class people that average Joe like [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=58.68s)]
*  me. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=64.92s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=65.92s)]
*  He said at this point, I'm desperate, so I'm willing to try anything right now to make [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=67.64s)]
*  sure I can take care of my wife and kids. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=70.92s)]
*  That's all I care about. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=72.72s)]
*  Do you agree with him? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  I agree 100%. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=76.92s)]
*  It's sad because Kamala's you know, she's essentially running it right now with Biden [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  and you're seeing Stellantis leave, you're seeing GM leave, you're seeing John Deere [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=84.2s)]
*  leave and send their production overseas into Mexico. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=88.48s)]
*  Keep in mind back in 2019 when GM was a strike target and Mary Barra became very frustrated [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=93.0s)]
*  at that time. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=98.76s)]
*  She had threatened to move production out of the country as well and Trump was very [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=100.28s)]
*  quick to come back and say, if you do, I will hit you with so many tariffs that you won't [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=103.56s)]
*  be able to sell your product back in our country. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=107.36s)]
*  So we can pretend all we want that the Democrats are for us, but they're not. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=110.0s)]
*  They're not. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=114.83999999999999s)]
*  I've learned this over the years. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  Like I said, I was a lifelong Democrat, voted for Obama, both terms. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=116.83999999999999s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=121.6s)]
*  All I saw was was more losses and more jobs going overseas during the Trump administration, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=122.6s)]
*  nothing but growth and record sales. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=128.48s)]
*  And at this point, the fake optics don't work anymore. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  You can't tell us at the grocery store, oh, the economy is doing great. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=134.48s)]
*  It's just in your head. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  We're not hurting. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=138.98s)]
*  No, we are hurting. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=139.98s)]
*  All of us are hurting to pay our bills and all those different things. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=140.98s)]
*  And it's frustrating for us because you hear all these things about, well, everybody wants [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=144.7s)]
*  EVs. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=151.29999999999998s)]
*  Well, they don't. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  They don't. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=153.5s)]
*  Clearly they don't want the EVs. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=154.5s)]
*  The sales are abysmal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=155.5s)]
*  They sold so many low units of the Lightning, for instance, and the Mach-E at Ford that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=157.06s)]
*  they cut production. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=162.14s)]
*  They ended up cutting two of the shifts and they're cutting down the remaining shift. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=163.42s)]
*  The remaining shift left is going to be stopped and laid off for in November to January sometime, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=167.88s)]
*  ironically, right around the same time as the election. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=175.24s)]
*  So I mean, you can put two and two together. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=177.96s)]
*  James, it's so sad because we keep hearing stories like this from you and other workers, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=179.64s)]
*  but the union still decided to endorse Kamala Harris. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=185.32s)]
*  And that's the troubling part of this story. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=188.72s)]
*  James, hopefully we can get you back. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  I wish I had more time with you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=193.24s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQlk7lQwWY&t=195.44s)]
