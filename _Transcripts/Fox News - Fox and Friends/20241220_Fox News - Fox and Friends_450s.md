# Peter Doocy: The dam is breaking
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg)
*  An explosive report for the Wall Street Journal shedding light on how the White House functioned [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=0.0s)]
*  or didn't function with a diminished Biden in charge. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=8.8s)]
*  Peter Dixon joins us from Washington. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=9.8s)]
*  Hey Peter. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  And when I got to the White House four years ago with President Biden, he was walled off [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  because of COVID. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=17.48s)]
*  They didn't want him to get sick. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=18.48s)]
*  But then he stayed walled off. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=19.94s)]
*  And now the Wall Street Journal has the site and with the headline, how the White House [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=22.06s)]
*  functioned with a diminished Biden in charge. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=25.64s)]
*  And it comes with this quote, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=28.619999999999997s)]
*  If the president was having an off day, meetings could be scrapped altogether. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=30.619999999999997s)]
*  On one such occasion in the spring of 2021, a national security official explained to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=35.9s)]
*  another aide why a meeting needed to be rescheduled. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  Quote, he has good days and bad days and today was a bad day. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=43.9s)]
*  So we're going to address this tomorrow. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=47.82s)]
*  The former aide recalled the official saying. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=49.82s)]
*  The president showed natural signs of aging, but key allies always stuck their necks out [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=52.7s)]
*  to say no big deal. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=59.46s)]
*  Right after the debate, you insisted that President Biden is extraordinarily strong. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  Given where we are now, do you have any regrets about what you told the American people? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=68.7s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=73.62s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=75.94s)]
*  I talked to President Biden, you know, regularly, usually several times in a week. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=76.94s)]
*  His mental acuity is great. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=81.78s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=83.66s)]
*  It's as good as it's been over the years. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=84.66s)]
*  Do you think the president should undergo some cognitive testing? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=86.66s)]
*  No, I think he needs to. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=89.66s)]
*  To the extent that we're having this conversation, I don't see any need to do that as it relates to Biden. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=91.33999999999999s)]
*  Things have changed a lot, but no obvious second thoughts. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=96.82s)]
*  You prepare to leave the White House. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=102.46s)]
*  Any other regrets that you have? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  Anything you wish you would have done differently? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=107.74s)]
*  Well, I guess if I thought a lot about it, it would be something I'd have done specifically, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=110.74s)]
*  but not generically. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=114.74s)]
*  I had a front row seat to a lot of this and at various times was basically told not to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=119.74s)]
*  believe what I was seeing or hearing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  The president misspoke. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=127.46s)]
*  The president has a cold. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=128.7s)]
*  But now the dam appears to be breaking. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=130.34s)]
*  This Wall Street Journal item interviewed 50 people familiar with Biden's operation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=132.54s)]
*  Peter, you had this story in August. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=138.98000000000002s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal began to dip their toe in the water on this very topic and they got blasted. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  You've gotten blasted when you questioned the president's acuity. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  Kamala Harris offended that people even bring it up. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=149.98000000000002s)]
*  But they talk about interaction between Biden and many of his cabinet members were infrequent, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=152.98000000000002s)]
*  often tightly scripted. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  At least one cabinet member stopped requesting calls with the president because it was clear that such a request [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=158.98000000000002s)]
*  wouldn't be welcome. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=163.98000000000002s)]
*  The cabinet! [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=164.98000000000002s)]
*  Peter Ducey can't get an interview. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=166.1s)]
*  His own cabinet can't get a meeting. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=168.1s)]
*  Adam Smith, who's chairman of armed services, tried to tell the president how bad Afghanistan could turn out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=170.1s)]
*  He couldn't get to him. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=177.1s)]
*  This is cataclysmic. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=179.1s)]
*  And it raises a lot of questions about who was making key decisions. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=181.1s)]
*  You mentioned the Afghanistan withdrawal. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=185.1s)]
*  If the president was as diminished as this story makes it sound, that would be a huge problem. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=187.1s)]
*  And it could explain why certain decisions were made that turned out to be catastrophic and why no apologies were ever made. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=195.22s)]
*  To your point, Brian, when the cabinet met all nine times, which is the least in the last several decades [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=203.22s)]
*  that a president has had their whole cabinet together in an entire term, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=211.22s)]
*  there was a different item a few months ago where cabinet secretaries were being asked to submit their questions [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=215.22s)]
*  for the president behind closed doors in advance. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=222.34s)]
*  And they were being told to keep it quick because the way that it worked was they would ask a question [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=225.34s)]
*  that was pre-screened and then the president would have a card with the answer, even in a closed setting. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=231.34s)]
*  And I hear a lot of the complaints about, and there was a bite in the open, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=236.34s)]
*  why wasn't there more coverage of the president's age and acuity earlier? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=243.34s)]
*  Well, a lot of the stories that you hear... [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=248.34s)]
*  You kept asking. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=250.46s)]
*  I kept asking the whole time. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=251.46s)]
*  And a lot of the stories that we would hear, that we would try to report out are secondhand. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=253.46s)]
*  But it's a lot of stuff like, oh, you would hear from somebody on the staff or somebody that works at the White House [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=259.46s)]
*  that looked like the president was falling asleep somewhere. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=264.46s)]
*  Okay, hard to confirm that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=267.46s)]
*  But we have tape of him falling asleep at events as recently as his most recent foreign trip. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=270.46s)]
*  You know, it was off the record last Friday there was a holiday party at the White House. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=277.58s)]
*  You had a brief interaction that has not been reported [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=282.58s)]
*  and it kind of speaks to how his aides just ripped you essentially out of that room when you two started talking. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=285.58s)]
*  It was actually kind of funny. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=294.58s)]
*  I took my sister Mary as my plus one. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=296.58s)]
*  And when we got up there, I said, Mr. President, this is my sister Mary. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=300.58s)]
*  And the first thing he said to her is, you know, my sister tries to control me. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=304.7s)]
*  And the First Lady and the press secretary who was standing off to the side were trying to keep the line going. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=310.7s)]
*  And they did. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=317.7s)]
*  And so it was quick. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=318.7s)]
*  But a lot of that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=319.7s)]
*  And I think he might have said something like, I'd like to talk to you later. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=322.7s)]
*  And then it's like, come on, Peter, let's go. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=326.7s)]
*  And there you went. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=328.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=329.7s)]
*  With your sister Mary, who tries to control you too. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=330.7s)]
*  It's true. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=334.7s)]
*  But I made sure that Mary did what I always do with these White House parties. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=335.7s)]
*  They have like napkins with the presidential seal. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=339.7s)]
*  So just make sure that as many as you can grab on your way out. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=342.7s)]
*  That's the lovely party gift. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=345.7s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=347.7s)]
*  This is embarrassing as a country. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=348.7s)]
*  I mean, everyone's talking about the Republican Party right now and who's debating this bill and Elon Musk. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=351.7s)]
*  Who's running the country right now? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=358.7s)]
*  And the fact is that the report said this was months into the presidency. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=360.82s)]
*  That means as we reported back then when I was Sean Hannity's correspondent, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=365.82s)]
*  I used to go in front of Joe Biden's house during the campaign trail, that it wasn't about COVID. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=370.82s)]
*  That he was diminished before he even was sworn in. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=377.82s)]
*  It only got worse as he was in office. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=379.82s)]
*  So, I mean, I don't understand how they have any credibility anymore. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=382.82s)]
*  This is so serious. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=385.82s)]
*  And it is such a big deal because if this was going on when he was making decisions about the Afghanistan withdrawal, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=386.94s)]
*  how do you think you would feel if you're the parents that lost a child at the Abbey Gate? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=392.94s)]
*  Who decided? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=397.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=398.94s)]
*  How about they fought for 20 years in a war if they fought for the right reason [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=399.94s)]
*  and to build a society that had somewhat representation of women and people who have opportunity. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=403.94s)]
*  I think that this disqualifies Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Kamala Harris, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=408.94s)]
*  KJP. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=416.06s)]
*  They all lied to us. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=417.06s)]
*  They told us he was fine. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5R4rrd-uXg&t=419.06s)]
