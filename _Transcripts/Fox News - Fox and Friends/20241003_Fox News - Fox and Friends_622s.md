# 'Fox & Friends': Where is Joe Biden?
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk)
*  All right, the dock worker strike is just one of three major crises the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=0.0s)]
*  Hayden Barus Harris administration is facing. There's also the severe damage [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  after Helene and the escalating conflict in the Middle East. Meanwhile, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=9.08s)]
*  our current president, Joe Biden, spent 16 days in the last two months in that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=13.64s)]
*  chair. I think it's a Tommy Bahama chair at the beach in Rehoboth Beach, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=19.96s)]
*  Delaware. How lovely Mark Meredith is live at the White House. Mark, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Lawrence Ainsley and Steve. Good morning, friends. Later today, President [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=28.64s)]
*  Biden is set to return to the south. He's gonna be touring the hurricane [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=31.32s)]
*  damage left behind from Hurricane Helene. He'll be in south Georgia, and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=34.440000000000005s)]
*  it comes just one day after the president was in the Carolinas. The [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=37.88s)]
*  president getting a firsthand look at some of the devastation while the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  federal emergency management agency says it doesn't know how much money [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=45.24s)]
*  it's going to need to clean up this damage. Also, it doesn't know if it's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=48.78s)]
*  gonna have enough money to make it through the rest of hurricane season, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=52.6s)]
*  which stretches on until the end of November. DHS officials say they don't [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=55.4s)]
*  know how much money they're gonna ask Congress for. Biden critics, though, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=59.68s)]
*  say they are amazed that the president is making the trip while accusing him [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=62.88s)]
*  of being missing in action as Helene hit. Our latest count shows the president [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=66.28s)]
*  spending a lot of time away from Washington, and this is not a new [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=70.76s)]
*  trend. Biden's raised eyebrows before for his constant travels away from [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=74.2s)]
*  Washington. When President Trump was in office, he too was regularly criticized [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  for visiting Florida and New Jersey on a regular basis. This week, though, the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=81.48s)]
*  president rejected the idea that he's asleep at the wheel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=85.2s)]
*  Mr President, why weren't she and Vice President Harris here in Washington [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  commanding this this weekend? I was commanding. I was on the phone for at [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=93.28s)]
*  least two hours yesterday and the day before as well. I command is called [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=97.76s)]
*  telephone. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  There's an op ed on Fox right now from David Marcus, who writes in a normal [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=104.42s)]
*  world, Joe Biden would have stepped down by now and be free, free to lay on the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=107.78s)]
*  beach in Delaware all day, which he does anyway. But these are not normal [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=111.44s)]
*  times. So until January 20th, the best we can do is cross our fingers and hope [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=115.22s)]
*  for the best. Vice President Harris, she too was touring the disaster damage on [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=120.5s)]
*  Wednesday. But today she returns to the campaign trail with an event this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=125.16s)]
*  evening in Wisconsin. Steve Lawrence and Ainsley. Hey, Mark. So the president [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=128.36s)]
*  snapped at that reporter who asked about, you know, you feel bad about not [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=133.36s)]
*  being here for that crisis. Uh, and another time he said, Well, I was only [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=137.26s)]
*  90. I was only 90 miles away. 90 miles is how far Cuba is from Florida. So [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=142.26s)]
*  that, you know, that puts it into perspective. That is kind of a long [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=148.98s)]
*  ways. Well, Steve, just yesterday on the Air Force one trip down Alejandro [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=152.54s)]
*  Mayorkas, the DHS secretary was asked, What is the reason you guys are going [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=156.7s)]
*  down to the Carolinas now is because former President Trump went down there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=160.16s)]
*  I believe it was on Monday that he was down there and DHS said, No, that's not [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=163.94s)]
*  the case at all. We're focused on disaster recovery. The White House has [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  also pushed back on the idea that this was disaster tourism. Instead, they [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=171.18s)]
*  wanted to make sure that they had the resources to protect security for the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=174.5s)]
*  president, but also not take away law enforcement needs for the folks that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=178.7s)]
*  are down there. Obviously they got to keep looters out. They've got to make [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=181.9s)]
*  sure that roads can be reopened, allow trucks to get back in. So, Steve, the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=184.74s)]
*  White House pushing back quite hard on the idea that the president didn't care. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=188.52s)]
*  But as we saw in that op ed, critics say that this is still just such an [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=192.78s)]
*  unusual time. It's so interesting to me. Thank you, Mark. They said that the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=196.18s)]
*  current president, Secret Service and the security protective detail, it's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=202.22s)]
*  the same as Donald Trump. So if Donald Trump is going there, why couldn't they [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=209.26s)]
*  do the same thing? And I just think it's just awful of him to condescend the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=213.7s)]
*  reporters like that and talk to them nasty like that, saying, you know, I [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=217.42s)]
*  could just use my phone. There's a difference from your presence being [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=221.5s)]
*  there from what I'm hearing on just accounts from people we've interviewed [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=224.66s)]
*  or people that have been on social media. I don't even know if they care. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=228.9s)]
*  Joe Biden shows up. They want federal money. They want resources. They want [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=232.92s)]
*  helicopters to go in and rescue these babies and these older people that are [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=237.74s)]
*  trapped in their homes. There's so many civilians that are doing it through [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=241.62s)]
*  different organizations and nice millionaires or billionaires or [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=245.28s)]
*  whoever. They're putting red tape up for those people that are using their own [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=249.78s)]
*  private resources. They want Washington to say bring in National Guard, bring in [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=253.54s)]
*  whoever can help. So yesterday, Kamala Harris pledged that the administration [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=258.18s)]
*  would cover 100% of the local government cleanup costs. And as you look [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=262.74s)]
*  at Asheville, you can just tell there's going to be a lot of money. But [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=266.62s)]
*  here's the problem. The Federal Emergency Management Agency administration [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=270.66s)]
*  apparently does not have enough money if there's another storm. Secretary [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=277.09999999999997s)]
*  Majorca said this yesterday. FEMA does not have the funds to make it through [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=281.53999999999996s)]
*  the hurricane season. Here's the problem. The hurricane season runs through the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  last day of November. They are expecting another hurricane, but they don't have [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=290.53999999999996s)]
*  enough money. And in fact, Speaker Johnson with with us yesterday and he [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=296.23999999999995s)]
*  was talking a little bit about, you know, it's all about priorities. If we [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  need more money, we've got to change things around. They should change things [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=304.92s)]
*  around at the Department of Homeland Security that Majorca is in charge of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=309.2s)]
*  because they've got millions and millions of millions of dollars not going [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  toward Americans, but going toward processing people who are in this [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=317.88s)]
*  country illegally. Well, I mean, it's look at that. Look at that number that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=321.56s)]
*  we're head. That would help with a lot of dollars. And now we're up to 600 and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=326.12s)]
*  that money should go toward these American families that have lost [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=330.24s)]
*  everything. I mean, there's there's no. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=333.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, if you're going to have the policy of just keeping the board border [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  wide open, you know, you're going to have to spend more money for processing and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=342.0s)]
*  migrant shelters and feeding those kids that are coming across the border [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=345.32000000000005s)]
*  because you said that it was OK for the parents to come across the border. We [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=348.5s)]
*  knew that there was going to be some sort of deficit with the surge of [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=352.04s)]
*  migrants coming across the border. It looks like the administration didn't [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=355.74s)]
*  calculate that with the request from Congress. And now they don't have enough [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  money from when the things that we need, which is the American citizens in [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=362.96s)]
*  the middle of a crisis, is pretty sad. You know what? The president and vice [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=366.35999999999996s)]
*  president, my orcas should announce a pause. We're going to have a pause on [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=370.79999999999995s)]
*  all the people coming into the country illegally and processing them. And [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=374.96s)]
*  we're going to reprogram that money to take care of the people here in the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=379.52s)]
*  United States. But a couple of reports came out yesterday and they're very [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=383.24s)]
*  damning. One of them was from the Department of Homeland Security's [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=387.2s)]
*  inspector general. And this should scare everybody. They said that CBP, ICE, and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=390.24s)]
*  TSA did not fully assess the risks associated with releasing non-citizens [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=397.32s)]
*  into the United States. In particular, think about this. A couple of the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=404.44s)]
*  agencies rely on people. OK, who are you? And they they gave them a name. So that's [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=410.76s)]
*  going to be the name that they put on a document. And that's why Tim Walz the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=415.36s)]
*  other day said, you know, they're traveling in the country legally. They are [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=419.2s)]
*  in the country legally because the federal government gave them that piece [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=423.24s)]
*  of paper. The problem is, according to the inspector general at the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=425.92s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security, you can't trust that. And it is of particular [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=431.08s)]
*  interest because TSA, people who get on the airplane, they don't really know who [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=435.36s)]
*  they are. They've just got a piece of paper from the Department of Homeland [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=440.91999999999996s)]
*  Security that says, I'm this person. They don't know. And that's why it was quite a [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=444.08s)]
*  warning from the inspector general yesterday. DHS 2025 Homeland threat [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=449.08s)]
*  assessment says this over the next year, we expect some individuals with terrorism [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=453.64s)]
*  ties and some criminal actors will continue their efforts to exploit [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=458.35999999999996s)]
*  migration flows and the complex border security environment to enter the United [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=463.36s)]
*  States. So does it make us feel safe? The interesting thing about this is that you [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=468.59999999999997s)]
*  have to layer that report from the inspector general to the the quote that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=472.28s)]
*  we got from DHS upset about Tony Gonzalez releasing the numbers about the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=477.16s)]
*  amount of criminals, rapists, as well as murderers that were coming across. People [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=482.56s)]
*  that had criminal records coming from guns. And they said it was over a 40 year [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=486.52000000000004s)]
*  period. But as I told you guys during that period of time, it's a numbers game. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=490.12s)]
*  The more people that you have coming across the border that are unvetted, the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=494.64000000000004s)]
*  higher that number is going to be. And so on one hand, they want to dispute that [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=498.96000000000004s)]
*  big number and say it's over a 40 year period. But then you get an inspector [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=503.36s)]
*  general report that says, hey, just a cautionary tale here, guys. Be be aware. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=508.24s)]
*  This is what's coming across the border. You just can't have it both ways. Well, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=513.5600000000001s)]
*  the system that is in place right now is not safe. Ultimately is what the [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=517.32s)]
*  inspector general saying. We can't trust the people. They could have terror ties. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=521.4s)]
*  And when you look, look at this under Donald Trump, there were 11 encounters at [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  the southwest border under Biden Harris. It is a much larger number. And when you [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=530.76s)]
*  look at the number of people who are coming into the country illegally from our [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=535.48s)]
*  northern border, it's exploded because people figure, OK, all all the guards are [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=539.52s)]
*  down south. I'm going to come in. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=545.5600000000001s)]
*  We put that number back. Can we put that look at that terrorist though? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=546.96s)]
*  Eleven compared to three hundred and seventy five. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, that just shows you. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  A secure border, I mean, there's still going to be some people that usurp the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  system, but when you just leave it wide open, of course, those are only the ones [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=561.48s)]
*  we know. Yes, it only takes one to have a terrorist attack. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=566.36s)]
*  Yeah, three hundred and seventy five. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=570.4s)]
*  We know are loose in our country. I just know that. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=572.16s)]
*  And we just had that Iranian. That's right. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=574.4s)]
*  Against President Trump. That's right. And it's still it's still ongoing. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=576.8s)]
*  I just know that in politics and, you know, both sides, you go back and forth, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=579.3199999999999s)]
*  on the issue. But there is no one that is an honest broker that believes that [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=583.8s)]
*  the board, that Donald Trump is against a secure border. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=588.48s)]
*  I know they keep bringing up the bill and his actions in there. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=591.24s)]
*  But the reality of it is four years ago, the border was secure. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=594.24s)]
*  And now we have these latest numbers showing us a much different tale. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=597.8399999999999s)]
*  And I think that's why he continues to win sometimes 20 points on the issue of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=601.92s)]
*  the border, because people know what life was like under him, whether you agree [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=606.04s)]
*  with him or not. I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3-8ZTABmDk&t=610.1999999999999s)]
