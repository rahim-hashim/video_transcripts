# BREAKING: Canada, Mexico vow retaliation for Trump tariffs
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA)
*  OK, on this Monday, President Trump is expected to speak with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=0.0s)]
*  Mexico and Canadian leaders today ahead of those tariffs that are supposed to kick in at midnight tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  But our North American allies are now vowing to strike America back. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=10.88s)]
*  Our senior White House correspondent, Jackie Heinrich, joins us now with the latest. Hey, Jackie. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=16.16s)]
*  Good morning to you guys. Yeah, President Trump is expected to speak with the leaders of Canada and Mexico this morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=20.72s)]
*  But unless he changes his mind, which he says that he won't, at midnight, the U.S. will impose a 25 percent tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=26.24s)]
*  including a 10 percent tariff on Canadian energy and a 10 percent tariff on all goods from China. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Altogether, China, Mexico and Canada account for more than 40 percent of imports into the U.S. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=40.72s)]
*  But the president says he's fulfilling a campaign promise to respond to illegal immigration and drug trafficking. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=45.84s)]
*  We subsidized Canada by the tune of about 200 billion dollars a year. And for what? What do we get out of it? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=53.12s)]
*  We don't get anything out of it. We can play the game all they want. Mexico. We've had very good talks with them. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  And this is retaliatory. This is retaliatory to a certain extent. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=66.8s)]
*  The White House accused Mexico's government of having a, quote, intolerable alliance with Mexican drug cartels. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=72.88s)]
*  Mexican President Claudia Scheinbaum is expected to announce retaliatory tariffs today, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=78.64s)]
*  and she called on Trump to clamp down on the flow of guns from the U.S. that arm the cartels. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  Outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has already set a 25 percent retaliatory tariff on one hundred and seven billion dollars worth of U.S. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  goods from cosmetics to lumber to plastics. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=95.08s)]
*  China's Commerce Secretary promised a legal trade case at the World Trade Organization, as well as corresponding countermeasures. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=98.32s)]
*  Here's what Americans are going to see. Higher prices for energy, higher prices for groceries. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  It means that the average American family is going to have their costs increased by twelve hundred dollars for one year. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  You might want to call this the Donald Trump Super Bowl tax. Price is going to go up. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=120.32s)]
*  Now, the president admits that there might be some short term pain for Americans, but he says it will all be worth it in the end. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=126.28s)]
*  He also said the U.S. will definitely place tariffs on the EU, citing a 300 billion dollar trade deficit. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=132.48s)]
*  The EU said that it would respond firmly, calling tariffs hurtful on all sides. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=138.92s)]
*  So, Jackie, the Democrats very effective yesterday. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=145.48s)]
*  They put everybody out on the Sunday shows talking about how the tariffs are going to impact all Americans. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=148.67999999999998s)]
*  We're going to pay more for everything. Is the White House putting anybody out so far to explain why they're a good idea? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=153.28s)]
*  Not yet. There's plenty of sound from the president himself last night when he got back to the White House. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=160.72s)]
*  This is also something he's promised on the campaign trail for many, many months. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  That being said, we don't have a clear idea of the president's schedule yet today. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=170.44s)]
*  Yeah, Lindsey Graham was going, was defining it and fighting for it over the weekend. Thanks so much, Jackie. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=174.16s)]
*  So, I mean, here it is. He says, I want to reconfigure trade relationships with Qatar and Mexico. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=179.84s)]
*  The USMCA feels it's not being enforced and he's going to put 25 percent on each, 10 percent on China, 10 percent when it comes to energy in Canada, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=185.04s)]
*  because he understands that it's going to immediately affect gas prices. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=193.2s)]
*  But I think the fact that they're both meeting today with both leaders say that there's something that could be at least delayed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=196.6s)]
*  But the reason for the emergency, to have an emergency tariff, you need to say, what's the emergency? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  And the emergency is, according to a 1977 law to establish the emergency, it is fentanyl. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=208.04s)]
*  Because look how many people it's killing, look how it's coming across both borders. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=213.52s)]
*  Therefore, there's the reason. And this is the action. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=217.08s)]
*  Well, in particular, two weeks ago, he said there was an energy emergency. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  And so he signed that declaration. But now he's attacking. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=225.08s)]
*  He's going to attach a 10 percent tariff onto Canadian crude oil. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=229.0s)]
*  That's one of the reasons a barrel of Canadian crude is up two bucks. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=234.28s)]
*  The stock market futures have been selling off to the tune of six hundred dollars. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=238.88s)]
*  But Brian, I think I think the fact that he is a master negotiator and he said, you know, it's going to start at midnight. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of time between now and midnight. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=249.2s)]
*  He can make a deal with Mexico and Canada and say, OK, I was threatening 25 percent. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  You want it 10 percent. What am I going to get for that 15 percent? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=257.56s)]
*  What am I going to get for that? I bet there's a little give and take. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=260.28s)]
*  I think there'll be a deal today. He said that we subsidize Canada subsidized Canada by about 200 billion per year. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=263.12s)]
*  And he says that's abuse. Canada is taking taking advantage of America. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=270.68s)]
*  So it's twofold. It's helping with the border. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  But it's also getting their attention because their goods are going to cost more. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=277.12s)]
*  It's going to make Americans want to buy goods that are made here. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=280.36s)]
*  It got their attention. But I just go back to this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  This Washington state congresswoman yesterday said, look, when it comes to lumber and they wanted him to tee off on Trump. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=286.12s)]
*  When it comes to lumber, the price is going to go up. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=291.68s)]
*  He said, well, we have the lumber, but there were so many restrictions on lumber in our forests. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=293.12s)]
*  If they can lift restrictions, we could actually keep the lumber contracts here. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=299.12s)]
*  And I'm thinking to myself, ding, ding, ding. That's it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=303.8s)]
*  Put pressure to make U.S. lumber great again. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  It's all a negotiating tactic. And so let's see what happens in the coming day. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  We need all that all the way to rebuild these houses in California, too. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=314.64s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwT8Q2XPSA&t=317.68s)]
