# Trump's mugshot now hanging outside Oval Office
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0)
*  Donald Trump has decided to hang his mugshot just outside the Oval Office so that this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=0.0s)]
*  is the door that you walk through. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=7.48s)]
*  Everybody who walks into the Oval Office from the outside has to walk through. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  There's another private entrance across the Oval Office. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=14.32s)]
*  But if you're anybody, head of state, reporter, anybody who walks into the Oval Office from [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=17.44s)]
*  has to walk right by that New York Post cover showing Donald Trump's mugshot. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=24.32s)]
*  And it's such a great message. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  It's like, oh, you think you're going to do something to me? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=32.16s)]
*  No. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=36.2s)]
*  It's all been done to me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=37.92s)]
*  Well, it's also a reminder that when he took that mugshot, I mean, this is just, it's a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=38.92s)]
*  badass mugshot. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=42.92s)]
*  Let's just be really honest. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  He's angry in it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=46.56s)]
*  I think he channeled the anger of the American people that the government was weaponized [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=47.92s)]
*  in this way against a political candidate. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=53.0s)]
*  We've never seen anything like this in the United States. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=55.44s)]
*  And you see that there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=58.5s)]
*  I was in the Oval Office, you guys, the day that Sean was sworn in. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=59.5s)]
*  And he had said to us that he was getting a bunch of paintings brought up of, like, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=66.08s)]
*  you know, different presidents. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=72.28s)]
*  And then the other day, Sean said he got them up. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=73.28s)]
*  They're all over, like all the presidents he loves are surrounding him in the Oval Office [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=75.92s)]
*  now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=80.0s)]
*  But this one was not there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=81.4s)]
*  And amazing, as you said, everybody can see it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=83.48s)]
*  And it's not the first time you've seen something that was supposed to humiliate him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=86.48s)]
*  He's turned into a triumph. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=91.16000000000001s)]
*  I mean, think about it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I'm not making this comparison to Jesus, but let's face it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  The cross was meant as a humiliation and the cross was turned into a sign of triumph. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  I think in the same way, Donald Trump has said, I'm not going to let you humiliate me. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to look that look in the camera and show my anger. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=105.84s)]
*  And now I'm going to hang it in the Oval Office when you tried to kick me out. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=108.64s)]
*  I just want to go on the White House tour where he's like, and over here is when the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=111.92s)]
*  left swung at me and missed and now I'm president. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=115.52s)]
*  But they only fueled his fire. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=119.32s)]
*  I mean, look at what he's been doing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=121.0s)]
*  I mean, every day is Christmas, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=122.28s)]
*  It's like every day, one day, it's like dog years, one day in Trump's administration, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=123.84s)]
*  like four years in another administration. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=127.88s)]
*  And this has just fueled him to get more done. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=130.48s)]
*  You can tell that he's learned a lot of lessons from his first term. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=133.48s)]
*  Look how organized this administration is. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=136.64s)]
*  You've got a lot of outside of the box thinkers, including President Trump, right? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  He was an outsider when he ran for office in 2016. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=142.16s)]
*  He's surrounding himself with disruptors, with reformists, with people who are outside [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=145.32s)]
*  of government. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  And so that's the angle they're taking. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  And he's really going to go down as probably one of the most transformational political [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=153.0s)]
*  figures in American history. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=156.2s)]
*  Look at how he's changed the Republican Party. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=157.48s)]
*  It's a totally different party because of him. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=159.48s)]
*  Look at how he's changed the media. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=161.2s)]
*  Look at how he's changed the way Americans even view their own government. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=162.88s)]
*  I mean, look at the corruption that he's been able to expose. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=165.64s)]
*  I think the greatest thing is this great realignment, right? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=168.0s)]
*  I mean, this idea that the Democrats now have nothing to stand on because every good idea [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  they had, Donald Trump is now implemented and they don't know where to go because their [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  whole thing has been like, I'm just anti-Trump. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=178.88s)]
*  Well, OK, are you and right? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=181.0s)]
*  They sing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=182.92s)]
*  Yeah, they sing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=183.92s)]
*  They sing in protest. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=184.92s)]
*  They're anti, like, you know, he's like, I'm rooting out government corruption. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=185.92s)]
*  I'm getting rid of all this stuff. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  And they're like, they're against that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=190.04s)]
*  You know, I'm for whatever. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=191.92s)]
*  They're just against everything he's for, which leaves them with nothing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=194.48s)]
*  Yeah, and they clearly did not spend the last four years sitting on the beach. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=198.0s)]
*  They were plotting every minute of it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=201.68s)]
*  Oh, Donald Trump. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=203.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=204.56s)]
*  No question about it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=205.56s)]
*  While Joe Biden was on the beach, Donald Trump was plotting. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=206.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=209.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se8IIeWy6p0&t=210.76s)]
