# Palestinian leaders reportedly plan to partner with Hamas in post-war Gaza
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84)
*  A live look at the Israeli-Gaza border, where the IDF is ramping up attacks on Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=0.0s)]
*  This, as U.S. officials are reportedly working with the Palestinian Authority on a plan for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  post-war Gaza. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=9.14s)]
*  When will that post-war position start? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=10.14s)]
*  Part of that plan, according to the PLO leaders, is to bring Hamas to the table as a junior [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=12.72s)]
*  partner. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=18.44s)]
*  Here to react, Fox News' senior strategic analyst, retired four-star General Jack Keene. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=19.44s)]
*  General, I imagine this is not, you don't think this is a good idea. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  No, absolutely not, and certainly not due to the Israelis. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=28.08s)]
*  I mean, the idea that the Palestinian Authority should be in charge fundamentally is a major [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  problem in and of itself, because they are a corrupt and ineffective organization, and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  they've been that way for the better part of 25, 30 years. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=42.56s)]
*  Even the Arabs recognize that, and that's one of the reasons why they wanted to normalize [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=47.2s)]
*  relations with Israel. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=51.84s)]
*  I'm talking about the UAE and Bahrain, because they knew no progress was being made with [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=53.08s)]
*  the Palestinian Authority. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=57.96s)]
*  And here, the people in charge of the Palestinian Authority, their leaders are saying, well, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=59.28s)]
*  Hamas would have to be a part of that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=64.44s)]
*  Can you imagine the absurdity of something like that? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=66.4s)]
*  Israel's not going to stand for anything like that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=70.12s)]
*  And number two, I mean, the Palestinian Authority is empathetic and sympathetic to Hamas. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=72.12s)]
*  They've not condemned what they have done in any way, shape or form. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=78.68s)]
*  That is not going to be the answer. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, listen, this is complicated, to be sure, in what the political entity should be. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=85.24s)]
*  What there is agreement on is that Palestinians should be in charge of Palestinians. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=91.74000000000001s)]
*  There is agreement on that, but what that entity is, is very complicated, and no one, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=97.56s)]
*  I believe, has a reasonable answer yet. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=102.44s)]
*  This certainly is not the answer. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=105.12s)]
*  General, your sources are telling you that the administration is clashing with the prime [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=106.72s)]
*  minister and Israel on what the objective and how long this war should last right now [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=112.1s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=117.5s)]
*  What could you tell us? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=118.5s)]
*  Well, that's a fact. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=119.5s)]
*  I mean, the administration wants this war in southern Gaza that's taking place now, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=122.02s)]
*  the campaign that we're seeing unfolding to end in a matter of a few weeks. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=132.42s)]
*  Hamas is more of a military organization than it is a terrorist organization operating out [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=133.42s)]
*  of small cells conducting limited attacks. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=140.1s)]
*  They're organizing the five brigades somewhere around 25,000, 30,000, and then below that, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=144.26s)]
*  multiple battalions, about 25 battalions, as a matter of fact. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=150.54s)]
*  The better part of four brigades are still intact. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=154.94s)]
*  Many of the middle grade leaders have been killed, but those organizations are out there, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=158.94s)]
*  and they are still effective. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=163.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=165.22s)]
*  So Israel does not want to slow this thing, speed this up, and end it in a couple of weeks. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=166.5s)]
*  The tempo of operations have picked up, but here's what's happening. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=173.46s)]
*  Hamas delayed in northern Gaza, trading space for time, and moved a lot of their people [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=177.14s)]
*  south. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=182.98s)]
*  Now they're defending, and that fight is going to take longer and it's going to be tougher [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=183.98s)]
*  on the IDF in dealing with this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=190.5s)]
*  The IDF has put out maps every single day telling the people living there what neighborhoods [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=193.38s)]
*  to evacuate from. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=200.84s)]
*  Well, they're also then telling, certainly, Hamas where they're going, and they're willing [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=202.06s)]
*  to do that, obviously, because they're trying to minimize casualties. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=208.82s)]
*  The reason why the administration is pushing this and end this as quickly as possible and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=212.54000000000002s)]
*  go to a ceasefire is certainly their concern about civilian casualties. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=218.2s)]
*  Well, the IDF is also concerned about those casualties. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  If we stop in a couple of weeks and say, okay, we've killed most of the leaders, we've destroyed [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=227.11999999999998s)]
*  most of the organization, that still leaves Hamas intact to be able to re-attack again. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=231.92s)]
*  The Israeli people will not stand for that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=238.56s)]
*  I cannot believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu or his IDF generals would stand for that either. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=241.16s)]
*  Man, the friction is going to come front and center too because that's going to be a couple [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=247.28s)]
*  of weeks. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  So far we understand Israel forces clashed with Palestinian fighters 15 times outside [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  Gaza at the West Bank. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=256.32s)]
*  So let Israel do the job so we're not back here again in a couple of years after this [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=257.92s)]
*  carnage that we all witnessed and that video is all available. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=263.2s)]
*  General, thanks so much. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=266.48s)]
*  Get the Institute to Study a War. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=268.2s)]
*  It handles all the hot spots in the world. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=269.68s)]
*  It really gets you up to date. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=271.36s)]
*  Thanks so much, General. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=275.0s)]
*  Thank you, Brian. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTqTACgzC84&t=275.5s)]
