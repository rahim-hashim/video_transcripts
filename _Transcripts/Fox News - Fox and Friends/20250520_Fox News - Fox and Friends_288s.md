*  Administration issued a ground delay due to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=6.16s)]
*  Staffing issues flights at the airport have already been delayed and canceled today after more than 100 were delayed yesterday [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=8.64s)]
*  This is just getting ridiculous Eric Sean is live in Newark Airport with the details Eric. What happened this time? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=15.96s)]
*  Yeah, good morning Lawrence the outage was brief, but it really raised alarms here at Newark International Airport [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=22.72s)]
*  It happened to be the fourth since last month that has highlighted concerns with the country's air traffic control system [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=28.68s)]
*  The FAA says yesterday the Philadelphia Center that handles the air traffic control for Newark lost radio frequencies about [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=36.76s)]
*  1135 in the morning it happened for only two seconds [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=44.68s)]
*  But you know that blip was long enough for controllers to have to alert pilots that there had been a problem [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=48.2s)]
*  The agency says though safety was not affected [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=53.64s)]
*  Just be advised we may be having a frequency outage that is occurring right now [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=57.84s)]
*  If you lose us they have four thousand and then just contact the Peterborough tower [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=61.92s)]
*  195 we're okay for now, but in case of a backup is gonna be still a kid brother [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=67.12s)]
*  55 how do you hear this radio? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=72.4s)]
*  Can everyone hear me on this frequency okay anybody that can I? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=75.28s)]
*  Yeah, you heard it can everyone hear me well the outage comes after the airport lost radar and communications on April [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=80.44s)]
*  28 then again for a minute and a half on May 9th [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=86.56s)]
*  And then there was another outage two days later [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  The issues after some controllers are moved from the New York Center that handles Newark down to Philadelphia last July [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=92.4s)]
*  Well the outages have caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights from here and staff shortages along with runway construction [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=98.8s)]
*  Have increased delays at Newark by 23 minutes the FAA is proposing limiting the number of arrivals to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=106.44s)]
*  28 an hour to try and ease the issues here at this very congested airport [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=113.32s)]
*  You know the Trump administration though vows to fix the traffic system by spending billions of dollars on new equipment [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=118.7s)]
*  radar and software [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=125.72s)]
*  Officials say some of the equipment they use dates back to the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=127.64s)]
*  1960s that's what he used to get real steak and champagne and economy [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=132.12s)]
*  Going to ask the reverse question [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=139.2s)]
*  How many flights are getting off on time? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=142.72s)]
*  That's a good. Well. That's a good question. We have like a 10 to 15 minute delays here average of 23 minutes [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=145.36s)]
*  So you gotta take that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=152.36s)]
*  23 is fine, but I mean it's just like every fight you every flight [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  They give you a vicinity of vicinity of when they're taking off [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=158.28s)]
*  Yeah, look what happened to Lawrence. You know I it's just you know sit and wait if you got time to spare go by air [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  Well what about so if I'm booking a flight and I live in New Jersey [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=168.72s)]
*  So I don't want to book out of Newark in case my flight's cancelled [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=172.56s)]
*  So I'm gonna go to the closest airport. What would that be would it be Philly because their problems there, too [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=176.46s)]
*  Well, you can go to JFK if you're traveling [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=181.52s)]
*  Long way, but yeah, you could [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=185.8s)]
*  Yeah, that really is or you're right. It's an hour and a half or so down in Philadelphia, but you know [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=188.4s)]
*  Maybe you'll get there faster [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  Eric can you go by Greyhound can you explain I mean I know we're talking about Newark [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  But this is an impact in all of the airports [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=200.64s)]
*  I mean I had my delay that was a LaGuardia and I talked to the pilot and he said look all the system [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=203.04s)]
*  The shortages when it comes to the step it's affecting us all [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=209.64s)]
*  Yeah, it really is it's not it's been more pronounced here at Newark in the National Airport [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=214.44s)]
*  Basically because of that move from New York Center [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=219.6s)]
*  Located in Long Island, New York and then last year the Biden administration [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=222.44s)]
*  Decided to move some of those controllers down to Philadelphia that handled Newark, but you've got the issues [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=227.8s)]
*  There was something in Houston a few days ago in terms of delay [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=233.16s)]
*  So this is maybe not as pronounced across the country [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=237.08s)]
*  But there are those issues and we're seeing it when you you know when you go in the friendly skies [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  Laura's if you have something major like a wedding if you're getting married [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=245.32s)]
*  The day before absolutely if you're going to get cancer treatment and you know MD Anderson or whatever you got to leave days ahead [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=249.4s)]
*  You know that now for now when wedding invitations just give the month whenever you get there [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=255.72s)]
*  Can we get a quorum we can start [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=269.92s)]
*  Let's see we get a witness majority are here [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUk5hLnllCI&t=273.76s)]
