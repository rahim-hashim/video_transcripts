**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow)
*  New developments in the U.S. as they talk with Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=0.0s)]

*  That came out yesterday and is now reportedly [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=6.12s)]
*  planning to revoke the legal status of nearly 250,000 [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=8.68s)]
*  Ukrainians who have fled here since the war began. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=12.0s)]
*  Special envoy to Russia and Ukraine, General Keith Kelleck [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=15.4s)]
*  joins us now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=18.52s)]
*  General, I know there was an emergency meeting [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=19.56s)]
*  of European allies without us yesterday in response [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=21.44s)]
*  to our pause in weapons and our holdoff [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=25.76s)]
*  on sharing intelligence. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=28.92s)]
*  What do you think comes from that and what's the U.S. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=30.64s)]
*  stance about that? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=32.56s)]
*  Yeah, Brian, thanks for having me this morning. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=35.72s)]
*  It's good to be with you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=37.44s)]
*  Look, this goes back to what President Trump has said [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=38.28s)]
*  all along to start with. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  And he's absolutely right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=42.800000000000004s)]
*  This war would not have started if he was president [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=43.800000000000004s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=46.24s)]
*  But he's been looking at this for a long time. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=46.92s)]
*  This isn't something he just came into on the 22 January [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=49.28s)]
*  when he was inaugurated. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=52.72s)]
*  He's been thinking about it, working about it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=53.96s)]
*  I mean, I remember him being on the campaign trail. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=55.56s)]
*  A year ago when we actually talked about it [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=59.68s)]
*  when we went into Iowa. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=61.04s)]
*  And look, he's basically said, look, this war [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  is an endless war right now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=64.96s)]
*  It's in almost a stalemate condition [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  and this war's gotta stop. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  What you're looking at, the levels of destruction [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=70.32s)]
*  is horrific. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=72.84s)]
*  It's World War II level of destruction. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  And the president sees that and he said consistently [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=75.64s)]
*  that he wants the war to stop and he needs to end the killing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  He's been very, very good at that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=81.24s)]
*  And when he looks at the Europeans, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=82.64s)]
*  he's trying to bring them along the same way. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  Saying, look, you've gotta come to some type [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  of negotiated solution to this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  This war is not gonna be decided on the battlefield. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  It's just not. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=90.68s)]
*  Because both sides are dug in, they're entrenched, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=91.84s)]
*  and the president sees diplomacy and he's very good at this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=94.72s)]
*  on coming to a solution. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=97.92s)]
*  And look, look what he's done in the last 40 days. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=99.12s)]
*  I mean, he's talked, he's had Steve Witkoff [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=101.76s)]
*  talking to Putin in Moscow. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=103.48s)]
*  You know, I've been in the Kyiv talking to Zelensky. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=106.08s)]
*  He's got an all-star team when you look at, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=108.36s)]
*  when you look at Besant from Treasury [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=111.6s)]
*  and you look at Steve Witkoff, the special negotiator [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  that are working with Russia. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=118.8s)]
*  When you look at Letnik, you look at Mike Waltz. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=122.4s)]
*  It's an all-star team that's got a full court press [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=124.64s)]
*  on trying to bring this to a resolution. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  And he's trying to bring the Europeans along with him. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=128.88s)]
*  So we know the deal. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=131.72s)]
*  And he's built to get, if you don't do it, don't do it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=132.56s)]
*  Right, so General, we know that it looks like [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=134.24s)]
*  they're ready to sign the Minerals Deal as it looks. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=135.96s)]
*  I don't know if they need to see each other face to face. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=138.44s)]
*  They could do a docu-sign, we do that every day. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  And then we get to it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=143.12s)]
*  Now, besides Russia talking to Witkoff [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  and saying to President Trump personally, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=147.96s)]
*  they're ready for peace, where is any Russian give? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  When can we see if Russia is actually gonna do [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  something substantial, any type of confidence building [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  on their end? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=158.24s)]
*  Because yesterday, they're still bombing cities [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=159.12s)]
*  and hospitals. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=160.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, Ryan, this is a war. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  This is the reason why President Trump wants to stop. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=166.84s)]
*  You know, war's not pristine. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=169.96s)]
*  And that's where, President Trump really sees that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=172.2s)]
*  And he sees the perfect casualties [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=174.76s)]
*  and the damage to the cities. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=176.44s)]
*  And he made that comment earlier when he, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  in last Friday, when he talked about [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  the damage to the cities. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=181.16s)]
*  Look at Mariupol, a major city absolutely destroyed. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  I've been inside Izium, which was a city of 70,000 [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=184.92s)]
*  down to 20,000, and the destruction I saw there, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  the president gets it, he sees it, where he wants to go. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=191.0s)]
*  He's got Steve talking to the Russians, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  talking personally to President Putin. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  And we've got a set of conditions, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  what we know that Steve's come back with. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=200.72s)]
*  We've gone to the Ukrainians and talked to them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  And we're gonna continue to talk to the Ukrainians [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=204.96s)]
*  to get confidence building measures [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  that we can bring to the president. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  We can say, okay, this is the way it stands on both sides. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=210.4s)]
*  This is where you want to go. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=213.08s)]
*  It's not an easy process. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=214.56s)]
*  It's a really difficult process. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  President said that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=217.68s)]
*  You know, remember he made the comment [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  that the Mideast is kind of easy compared to this? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=220.56s)]
*  So he's actually working it hard. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  He's got a great team in place and synchronized going forward. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  Now, being that we know where we're at, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=228.84s)]
*  when do we think we're gonna have more Russian talks? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=231.04s)]
*  When do you think we're gonna have the more, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=233.24s)]
*  Ukraine has pretty much said, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=234.6s)]
*  we'll sign the deal, we're ready to talk. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  So what's the next move with Russia? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=238.68s)]
*  Well, that's one of those where I think it's internal [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=242.24s)]
*  to the White House, the discussions going forward. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=244.88s)]
*  You know, Steve's got that, Mike Walsh has got that, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=248.96s)]
*  Marco Rubio's got that, and Marco's the chief diplomat [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  of the United States of America. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=254.44s)]
*  It's really on his plate to move that forward. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  So I don't wanna get ahead of the president. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=258.16s)]
*  I would never do that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=259.68s)]
*  This is his decision to make. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  He's the president, and we'll go from there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=262.32000000000005s)]
*  But I'll tell you, no American knows more about [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=264.56s)]
*  what this war's been like on the ground than you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=266.8s)]
*  You've been doing this as a private citizen. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=268.44s)]
*  That's why you're the perfect pick. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=270.44000000000005s)]
*  I gotta ask you to tap into your years [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=271.8s)]
*  of the military experience for this one, though. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=273.76000000000005s)]
*  The Gaza war and IDF and phase one of the peace deal. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=276.44000000000005s)]
*  Yesterday, the president put out a truth social post [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  after meeting with some of the surviving hostages. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=283.04s)]
*  He said, shalom hamas, means hello and goodbye. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=285.36s)]
*  You can choose. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=288.28s)]
*  Release all of the hostages now, not later, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=289.32s)]
*  and immediately return all of the dead bodies [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=292.08s)]
*  of the people you murdered, or it's over for you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=293.96s)]
*  Release the hostages now, or there will be hell to pay. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=296.2s)]
*  It's a little bit longer, but you get the theme. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=298.64s)]
*  He says, I'm gonna give the IDF everything they need [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  to finish you off. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=303.2s)]
*  What does, get in the mind of a terrorist. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=304.6s)]
*  How are they gonna internalize this? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, they're not reading the room very well. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=309.86s)]
*  Look, Eden and Alexander is the last American alive. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=313.2s)]
*  That's a hostage, and they've got four dead Americans [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=315.52s)]
*  they wanna bring back to the United States. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=317.8s)]
*  Look, this is something, you guys just don't read [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=320.84s)]
*  President Trump very well. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=323.09999999999997s)]
*  I go back to 2020, the last state of the union, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=324.8s)]
*  when in closing comments, he made, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=327.64s)]
*  if you harm an American, your life is forfeit. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=329.68s)]
*  And this, months after that, we went and picked up [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=332.64s)]
*  a guy named Philip Watson in Africa. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=334.44s)]
*  We sent SEAL Team Six in there [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=337.08s)]
*  just to get one single American. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=338.96s)]
*  That's the way the president thinks. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=340.96s)]
*  It's almost like, you're not only, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=342.28s)]
*  you're not reading the room, you're not reading [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  the individuals of the president of the United States. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=345.44s)]
*  He's been very, very clear. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=347.32s)]
*  And they just don't seem to get it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=348.88s)]
*  And he's absolutely right. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=351.52s)]
*  And the president has called this one right on the money. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=353.02s)]
*  So if I was Hamas, I'd say, you know something, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=355.88s)]
*  just release Alexander, get him back to the United States, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=358.29999999999995s)]
*  release the four bodies that we believe you still have, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=360.84s)]
*  and let's close this deal out. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=363.91999999999996s)]
*  Otherwise, you're gonna pay a horrible price. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=365.44s)]
*  But this is not anything new with President Trump. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=367.88s)]
*  It's the way he is, it's the way he operates. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  Adam Boller met face to face with Hamas leadership. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=371.96s)]
*  Are you okay with that? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=374.52s)]
*  And what do you think that does? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=375.76s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  Look, Adam Boller, that's his job to do that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=380.0s)]
*  And Caroline Levitt made those comments yesterday. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=381.88s)]
*  This is the job of the special envoy for hostage affairs. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=384.65999999999997s)]
*  And Adam's doing that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=388.96s)]
*  And Adam's very, very talented to do that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=389.88s)]
*  We just want to get the American back. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=391.84s)]
*  Eat him, Alexander. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=394.4s)]
*  He's the last one there. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=395.56s)]
*  Bring him home. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=396.97999999999996s)]
*  And that's what we're gonna do. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=398.52s)]
*  I think nobody can question, you know, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=399.47999999999996s)]
*  our efforts with Israel and supporting Israel [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  against Hamas and Hezbollah as well, and also Iran. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=404.0s)]
*  And this is just another step forward. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=407.36s)]
*  I don't think people should get worried [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  about the technicalities. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=410.32s)]
*  This is just us trying to finish the job. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, know that about the idea of this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=413.28s)]
*  The IDF will be the hammer [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=415.12s)]
*  if they do not produce the hostages. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=416.84s)]
*  Thanks so much, General Kellogg. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=418.98s)]
*  A lot on your shoulders, too. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=421.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS4S-oXqcow&t=431.76s)]
