# Dem leaders ‘flocking’ to Trump ahead of Inauguration Day
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro)
*  You know, well, with the new year comes a new presidency. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=0.0s)]
*  We were just talking about it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=3.4s)]
*  November 5th, Trump won. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=4.24s)]
*  And now he's making the rounds. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=6.72s)]
*  And so it was a big year for the GOP. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=8.64s)]
*  Of course, you had Trump's win that many of us [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=10.8s)]
*  consider a landslide. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=12.68s)]
*  Congress, both houses were won by Republicans. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=13.68s)]
*  And now, as some would put it, everybody just [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=18.28s)]
*  wants to be Trump's friend. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=20.96s)]
*  Progressive Mayor Muriel Bowser, she's the latest in flocking [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=22.14s)]
*  to Trump. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=25.42s)]
*  She wants to meet with him. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=25.92s)]
*  And she did meet with him, I guess, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=27.12s)]
*  to see how to make DC great again. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=29.2s)]
*  This is her statement. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=31.4s)]
*  She says, today, President Trump and I [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=32.32s)]
*  had a great meeting to discuss our shared priorities [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=34.44s)]
*  for the president's second term. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=38.04s)]
*  President Trump and I both want Washington, DC [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  to be the best, most beautiful city in the world. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=42.24s)]
*  And we want the capital city to reflect [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=45.12s)]
*  the strength of our nation. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=47.0s)]
*  I am optimistic that we will continue [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  to find common ground with the president [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=50.36s)]
*  during his second term. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=52.32s)]
*  And we look forward to supporting [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=54.08s)]
*  a successful inauguration on January 20th. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=55.64s)]
*  I guess it's kumbaya in the capital city. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=59.12s)]
*  It's about time, because Washington, DC [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=61.76s)]
*  has a lot of work to do to make it the most beautiful city [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  in the world. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=66.78s)]
*  And it should be, considering it's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=67.56s)]
*  the capital of the United States of America. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  And I think that the mayor is a little bit concerned [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=72.36s)]
*  that President Trump will work with the Republican Congress [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=75.2s)]
*  to revoke home rule and reestablish [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=77.64s)]
*  the governance of Washington, DC away [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=81.08s)]
*  from the local city council and the mayor, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=83.4s)]
*  who have done a terrible job. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=85.12s)]
*  You know what? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=86.32s)]
*  And I can say, as someone who actually [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=86.64s)]
*  lives in Washington, DC, the city [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=88.2s)]
*  was really moving and grooving back in 2017, 2018. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=90.24s)]
*  I think there was tons of construction, lots of optimism. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=94.52s)]
*  2019, COVID hit. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=97.76s)]
*  And then it was strange, because it [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=99.2s)]
*  was shutting down churches and shutting down schools, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=102.0s)]
*  but leaving open bars. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=105.0s)]
*  And it was just an odd time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=106.84s)]
*  And then 2020 had all the protests. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=108.6s)]
*  And it seemed like the mayor herself [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=110.52s)]
*  was sort of encouraging this protest culture. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=113.04s)]
*  And riots. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=116.44s)]
*  And riots in DC. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=117.12s)]
*  And listen, they burned buildings. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=118.08s)]
*  They broke things. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=119.76s)]
*  And the city is not recovered. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=120.76s)]
*  So I'm hopeful. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=122.2s)]
*  I'm sure she's hopeful as well. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=123.84s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=125.16s)]
*  We can all be hopeful. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=125.8s)]
*  DC should be a place where everybody in America [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=126.8s)]
*  and all around the world can bring their kids [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=128.88s)]
*  and feel safe, because he belongs to all Americans, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=130.76s)]
*  not just the people who live there. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=133.28s)]
*  You said it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=134.68s)]
*  And speaking of everyone wanting to be Trump's friend, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=135.8s)]
*  I pulled that line from this clip we're going to show. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=138.6s)]
*  This is Caroline Leavitt, the incoming White House press [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=141.64s)]
*  secretary. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=143.44s)]
*  She says Trump's going to deliver on his promises [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  on Hannity last night. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=146.2s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  As President Trump has said, everybody [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  wants to be his friend right now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=150.83999999999997s)]
*  And he's OK with that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=152.72s)]
*  He is building a team of people from Wall Street [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  to Main Street who want to make this country great again [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=157.16s)]
*  and help him deliver on the promises [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  that he made to the American people on the campaign trail. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=162.27999999999997s)]
*  Common sense solutions to fix the problems in their lives. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=165.39999999999998s)]
*  Cutting taxes, ending inflation, securing the southern border, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=169.04s)]
*  deporting illegal criminals, rapists, and murderers [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  from our American communities, and using peace through strength [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=176.0s)]
*  to end the wars and the chaos that we've [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=179.32s)]
*  seen the Harris-Biden administration cause abroad. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  It's truly a unifying message. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=184.56s)]
*  And as President Trump has repeatedly stated, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=186.12s)]
*  this country will be unified through success. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=188.64s)]
*  Positive words. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=194.44s)]
*  You know, I'm not surprised. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  And I think one of the things you're going to notice, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  as she goes on in her career as the press secretary, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=198.92s)]
*  is she's incredibly disciplined and on message. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, literally every single time. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=204.32s)]
*  But I think as she gets more experience, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  she's going to continue to expand the idea of convincing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  and selling. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  Not just telling you what the policies are, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  but also trying to bring those people who are maybe not [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=215.66s)]
*  so sure about the second Trump term, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=218.27999999999997s)]
*  she's going to be bringing them along. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  Because her real focus is going to be, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=221.6s)]
*  I want you as the American people [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=223.48s)]
*  to not just hear what we're doing, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=225.56s)]
*  but to understand and to take part. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=227.27999999999997s)]
*  Well, and when you have good policy outcomes [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=228.84s)]
*  and you have good facts, it makes it a lot easier [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=231.16s)]
*  as a communicator to talk about those things. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=233.48s)]
*  When the economy is not going well [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=236.04s)]
*  and your policies are resulting in hurting people [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=237.8s)]
*  either personally or hurting the economies of governments [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=240.44s)]
*  or causing damage, it's very difficult to explain that way. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=244.04s)]
*  Or like the previous White House, the one that's outgoing, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=247.4s)]
*  if you're trying to say that inflation is transitory, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=250.04s)]
*  that's not really happening, that what [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=252.76s)]
*  you're seeing with your own two eyes is not happening, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=254.6s)]
*  it's hard to explain that away. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  But if you have success that people can feel, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=258.04s)]
*  it's a lot easier to talk about it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=259.88s)]
*  You know, Kevin, that's a great point about Caroline taking [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=261.32s)]
*  this role and how she's going to do it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  I think she, there's multiple pictures of her sitting just [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=266.56s)]
*  off stage from, I think, one of the best press secretaries [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=269.6s)]
*  we've had in a while, Kayleigh, which is now our colleague. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=272.20000000000005s)]
*  But if you look at Trump's press secretaries, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=276.16s)]
*  from Sean Spicer, all the way through Sarah Huckabee Sanders [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=279.44s)]
*  and Kayleigh, there was such this antagonistic relationship. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=283.16s)]
*  Everyone in the press pool was coming in there [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=286.44s)]
*  trying to get gotcha. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=288.56s)]
*  I wonder, you know, on this topic of everybody [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=289.92s)]
*  wants to be Trump's friend, I wonder if that's actually [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=292.2s)]
*  going to change. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=294.12s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=295.0s)]
*  Because what do they want more than anything? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=296.04s)]
*  They want access. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=298.0s)]
*  They want to be able to sit down and ask a question. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=298.96s)]
*  They want to be able to pull the president to the side [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=301.12s)]
*  and get some answers. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=304.8s)]
*  And I think in this administration, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=306.2s)]
*  they've had almost zero opportunity for that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=307.64s)]
*  Well, when you look at the way that Joe Biden handled [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=309.6s)]
*  the press, he did it to his end of the year press conference. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=311.44s)]
*  He didn't answer questions. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=314.0s)]
*  And hiding from reporters, they've [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=315.08s)]
*  been very frustrated with the way [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  that they've handled a number of transparency issues. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=318.52s)]
*  Whereas Trump, during his first term, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=321.24s)]
*  was talking to the press every single day, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=323.0s)]
*  sometimes multiple times a day. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  He really was. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=327.64s)]
*  And Joey, you were so right about that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  And here's what I mean. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=330.64s)]
*  Basically, what we're probably going to see a lot more of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=332.52s)]
*  is people just trying to get to the meat and potatoes [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=336.24s)]
*  of what's happening. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=338.56s)]
*  You can interrogate a press secretary [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=339.68s)]
*  fairly without trying to make yourself the story. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=341.72s)]
*  There are a lot of people. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=345.48s)]
*  And I was listening. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=346.44000000000005s)]
*  I was covering the Trump White House during that era. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  And I think we could all name some names of people who really [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=349.64000000000004s)]
*  just wanted their gotcha moment. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  People holding the microphone at press conferences [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=354.8s)]
*  when they were supposed to let it go. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=358.04s)]
*  I won't mention any names. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=359.6s)]
*  We don't mention the names unless they want us to. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=361.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, unless they want us to. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=362.8s)]
*  But I think hopefully, at least based [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=364.12s)]
*  on what I've seen in the press room of late, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=366.04s)]
*  is more serious journalists, people who just want [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=367.88000000000005s)]
*  to get answers to questions. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=370.16s)]
*  And we can only hope for the best. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  And especially when I think back to what Sarah Huckabee-Sanders [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=373.8s)]
*  endured, just sort of the vitriol, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=377.76000000000005s)]
*  I think that's a change that we'll probably not [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=380.36s)]
*  have to see again. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=383.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, and the press has a big credibility problem [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  because of the way that they covered [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=386.24s)]
*  the Biden administration, especially in the last year [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=388.48s)]
*  when they got exposed for not asking the right questions [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=390.64000000000004s)]
*  and attacking fellow reporters for asking [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=394.16s)]
*  about cognitive decline, where the president is, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=396.32000000000005s)]
*  what his schedule is. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=398.92s)]
*  So they have a lot of making up to do [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=399.88s)]
*  when it comes to reporting fairly to the American people [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=401.6s)]
*  as well. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=403.96s)]
*  Let's see it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=404.56s)]
*  I know there will be other entities there [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=405.2s)]
*  that we haven't seen before. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=406.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=408.0s)]
*  I don't know if you can beat Peter Ducey, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=408.32s)]
*  but we'll have some other folks there. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=409.32s)]
*  There'll be there. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=410.76s)]
*  And Jackie. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=411.24s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=412.0s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHd1yuxdro&t=412.92s)]
