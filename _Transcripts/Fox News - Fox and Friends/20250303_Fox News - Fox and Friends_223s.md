# Cartels operatives living in fear amid Trump crackdown
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ)
*  Now that this cartel operatives in Mexico say they're worried about being arrested or even killed as Trump cracks down on our southern border. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Maddie Rivera is in Washington with more. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=7.44s)]
*  Maddie. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Hi guys. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=9.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=10.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=10.88s)]
*  The New York Times reports the Sinaloa cartel in particular has been disrupted because of President Trump's threats and Mexico's crackdown on cartels. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=11.06s)]
*  Cartel operatives have reportedly had to move labs to other parts of the country or temporarily stop production. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=19.32s)]
*  Other cartel members are becoming more afraid of being arrested or even killed. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=25.36s)]
*  One person telling the New York Times you can't be calm, you can't even sleep because you don't know when they'll catch you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=29.68s)]
*  The most important thing now is to survive. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=35.36s)]
*  After President Trump threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs, Mexico's president Claudia Scheinbaum deployed 10,000 National Guard troops to the border and hundreds more soldiers to the Sinaloa state to curb the flow of fentanyl. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=38.12s)]
*  The pressure against some criminal groups appears to have ramped up since then. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=50.6s)]
*  Mexico's security minister says there have been arrests and seizures every day. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=54.4s)]
*  Last month, the Trump administration also designated eight Latin American organizations as foreign terrorist organizations. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=59.24s)]
*  On Friday, 29 Mexican cartel members were extradited to the United States. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=65.92s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal also reports Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned the U.S. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=71.64s)]
*  military was preparing to take action against drug cartels if Mexico did not do more. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  The Defense Department reportedly declined to comment. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=80.72s)]
*  Lauren, Steve Ainsley and Brian. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  All right, Maddie. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=85.12s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=85.76s)]
*  So the cartel, interestingly enough, so the cartel leaders were able to talk to the New York Times. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  They were able to find them. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  We should be able to find those leaders. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=94.44s)]
*  And that is what is terrifying them. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Northern Virginia, if you were in the country illegally, you got a heads up over the weekend because of the reporter, rather the editor for the Migrant Insider Pablo Mencarez with 45,000 followers put out that ICE is planning raids today. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=98.0s)]
*  That's for Monday and tomorrow in Northern Virginia. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=116.16s)]
*  Seventy five to one hundred different warrants. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=120.24s)]
*  And as of about an hour ago, that had had six hundred and fifteen thousand views. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=122.44s)]
*  So the migrant community is well aware of what ICE has got planned. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=128.32s)]
*  Did you see what he was willing to put out there, though? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=132.76s)]
*  He said it was seventy five to one hundred judicial warrants. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=135.36s)]
*  I mean, a judge has signed an order for them to be brought into custody, but yet he was still OK with tipping them off. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=138.04s)]
*  It's dangerous for our guys. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=146.56s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=147.56s)]
*  Are there consequences for this guy? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=148.0s)]
*  I mean, do the police go after him now? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=150.0s)]
*  Because he's interfering with an investigation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=151.52s)]
*  But he's a reporter. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  He got information. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  It's whoever leaked it to him. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  It could be somebody from the courts. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=158.52s)]
*  It could be somebody from the federal government. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  I think that if you go out and hinder an investigation. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=162.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=165.28s)]
*  Just because you're a reporter doesn't matter. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  There should be consequences for that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=167.88000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  As a reporter, I'm going to broadcast to everyone. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=169.68s)]
*  You're defending people who have done something wrong. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  These are criminals. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=174.0s)]
*  I think the line is when you start to aid in a bet, whether you're a journalist or not, I don't even think that's journalism right there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  He's clearly trying to help these people that are there. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  That post was leaked also to the activists there on the ground as well. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=185.96s)]
*  So these people were just going to flee. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  This is what happened with Aurora as well. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=192.12s)]
*  Yeah, 200 federal agents that were flew from all across the country to help out with this raid. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  And they only end up catching about three or four of the people that they wanted to get. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=200.12s)]
*  Well, the guy got a scoop and it could come back to boomerang because ultimately ICE is going to go eventually and find those people. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzj4odsqjSQ&t=204.12s)]
