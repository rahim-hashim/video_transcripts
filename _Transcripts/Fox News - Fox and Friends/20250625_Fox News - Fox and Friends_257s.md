# California faces MAJOR alleged violation from Trump admin
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM)
*  Now, switching gears, remember when California's Governor Gavin Newsom said this? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=0.0s)]
*  Would you say no men in female sports? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=5.84s)]
*  Well, I think it's an issue of fairness. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=7.32s)]
*  I completely agree with you on that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=8.88s)]
*  It is an issue of fairness. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=10.68s)]
*  So it's deeply unfair. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=11.68s)]
*  So that's easy to call out, the unfairness of that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=13.14s)]
*  Well, now the Department of Education is announcing it has found that California violated Title [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=15.8s)]
*  IX, alleging the state discriminated against women and girls. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=20.76s)]
*  Education Secretary Lyndon McMahon joins us now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=25.52s)]
*  Good morning to you, Mrs. Secretary. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=27.84s)]
*  Good morning, Ainsley. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=30.8s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=31.8s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=32.8s)]
*  I'm doing very well. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=33.8s)]
*  Thank you for coming on and talking about this. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=34.8s)]
*  This is a concern. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=35.8s)]
*  I'm a mother to a little girl, too. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=36.8s)]
*  And moms all across the country and dads are concerned about this, people all across the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=38.24s)]
*  country, because we worry about fairness, like Gavin Newsom said, but we also worry [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=42.28s)]
*  about injuries to our little girls. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=46.46s)]
*  So what is the latest? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=48.8s)]
*  What's happening in California? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=50.0s)]
*  Well, I can announce, you know, today, Ainsley, that the Department of Education has found [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=51.8s)]
*  that the state of California, the Department of Education and their interscholastic sports [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=57.72s)]
*  federation is in violation of Title IX. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=64.28s)]
*  We are giving them 10 days to remedy that situation. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=68.52s)]
*  We have remedy for them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=71.24s)]
*  But if they do not comply within 10 days, then we will refer this to the Department [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=73.0s)]
*  of Justice. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=77.52s)]
*  And what exactly is the remedy for this? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  There are several steps to it, but I'll just kind of sum it up for you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=82.8s)]
*  They really need to send a letter of apology to all of the participants, female participants [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=85.36s)]
*  in sports. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=92.56s)]
*  They need to return the titles that were taken away from these women who competed and lost [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=93.8s)]
*  to male in the sports. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  And they just have to make it right to those women competitors. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, you know California, they probably won't do that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=106.4s)]
*  So what happens if they continue to violate and you don't get those, the letter, you [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=109.32s)]
*  don't get the apology and the titles given to the biological girls? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=114.08s)]
*  Well, they run the risk of losing their federal funding in their K through 12 schools, and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=117.52s)]
*  that's where these infractions were committed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=123.52s)]
*  It's very interesting to hear Governor Newsom say that it's a matter of fairness. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  It's easy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=131.48s)]
*  Talk is cheap. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=132.48s)]
*  I think he needs to put his money where his mouth is. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=133.48s)]
*  And several weeks ago, months ago, when this first happened, I sent him a letter and asked [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=135.52s)]
*  him to do just that if he's talking about fairness, but there was no action taken on [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=141.84s)]
*  his part. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  So he talks about it, but he doesn't do anything about it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  So we've stepped in. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=149.39999999999998s)]
*  We've investigated our Office of Civil Rights, investigated this thoroughly and found that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  was an infraction. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=156.92s)]
*  And so now we are demanding that they take action or will take action. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=158.64s)]
*  Well, I think that'll do it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  If you take away their federal dollars, how much money are we talking about? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=163.56s)]
*  Well, I'd have to look at that to be exact because there are different levels of it, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=167.88s)]
*  but it could be a substantial amount of money that would come into California. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=171.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=176.16s)]
*  Have you heard from the governor lately after this? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=177.16s)]
*  I know that didn't California file a lawsuit against the DOJ? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  It looks like that happened on June 9th. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=183.12s)]
*  Well, I have not heard anything, you know, from the governor at all. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  All I know is that our finding stands and they need to make this remedy and make things [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  right in California. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  It's not fair for women to have to compete. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=196.84s)]
*  You know, they train just as hard as the men. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  And they, women would, you know, the women who would have won this had to step down because [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  a man competed against them. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=207.44s)]
*  Men are faster, they're stronger. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  And then these, you know, this was track and field. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=212.84s)]
*  This was high jump. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=215.24s)]
*  It was long jump and it was a triple jump. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=216.28s)]
*  And women had their records taken away, opportunities for sponsorships or for scholarships. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  And it's also an issue of, as you mentioned, relative to your daughter, you worry about [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=223.32s)]
*  her safety competing against men who are stronger and bigger and faster in sports. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=228.32s)]
*  Some of the sports like boxing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=234.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=235.64s)]
*  And this was, you're talking about May 31st, it was a trans athlete who won two girls events [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=236.64s)]
*  at the California track and field finals. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=240.64s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=242.52s)]
*  And we've been covering that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=243.52s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mrs. Secretary, for coming on. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-km2eIr3BpM&t=244.52s)]
