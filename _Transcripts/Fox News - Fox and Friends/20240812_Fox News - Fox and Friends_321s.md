# Kamala Harris is 'completely changing her stance' on this key issue
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU)
*  Alright, Vice President Kamala Harris, did you hear this? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=0.0s)]
*  Doing a complete 180. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=2.2s)]
*  When it comes to her border messaging, promising now a crackdown during her visit to Arizona [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=3.44s)]
*  over the weekend. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=8.98s)]
*  So I was attorney general of a border state. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=11.6s)]
*  I went after the transnational gangs, the drug cartels and human traffickers. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=14.88s)]
*  We know our immigration system is broken and we know what it takes to fix it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  It includes strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=26.4s)]
*  We had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan border security bill in decades. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=35.08s)]
*  But when I am president, I will sign the bill. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=41.72s)]
*  But those words do not line up with what she has said in the past, including quote, an [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=46.08s)]
*  undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  She also said we must reexamine ICE and its role and we must fundamentally overhaul our [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=54.16s)]
*  immigration enforcement policies and practices. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=59.68s)]
*  They are cruel and out of control. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  Thomas Hodgson is a former sheriff and chairman of the Trump 2024 campaign in Massachusetts. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=65.36s)]
*  And he joins us now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=71.56s)]
*  Sheriff Hodgson, good morning to you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=73.16s)]
*  So what do you think of Kamala Harris's new messaging, claiming to be tough on the border? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=74.4s)]
*  Is anyone buying it? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=78.8s)]
*  Good morning, Carly. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=81.4s)]
*  And thank you for having me. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=82.4s)]
*  No, she's three years late and billions of dollars short. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=83.64s)]
*  What she has done is basically attempted to try to reverse everything that she's responsible [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=87.92s)]
*  for as well as Biden and Mayorkas. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=94.28s)]
*  They basically have put our communities across this nation in serious, serious debt with [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=96.36000000000001s)]
*  regards to the economy, our public safety. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=102.72s)]
*  We have people laying in the airport, Logan Airport, by the hundreds. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=105.86000000000001s)]
*  Our hospitals are overwhelmed. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=109.72s)]
*  It's outrageous. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=114.0s)]
*  And in one case in Boston, Massachusetts, in Roxbury, they actually kicked the kids [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=115.0s)]
*  out of the community center whose parents had kept them there after school and so forth. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  So they weren't on the street corners being exposed to the fentanyl pouring in. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=126.72s)]
*  They were kicked out of the community center so that these illegals who were coming into [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=130.36s)]
*  the country would have a place to stay. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=134.04s)]
*  It's outrageous. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=135.8s)]
*  And this is all part of the Biden-Harris policies. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=136.8s)]
*  Well, listen, she's completely changing her stance when it comes to the border, especially [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  when she talks to border states like Arizona, but even up in Massachusetts where you are, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  it's impacting your community as well, which says a whole lot. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=149.16s)]
*  And she has said in the past that she supports decriminalizing illegal immigration. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  She also equated ICE agents to members of the KKK. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=156.76s)]
*  So if she does become president, what does a Kamala Harris presidency looks like when [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  it comes to this issue? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  It's going to be a tragedy because she'll just continue doing what she's already done. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=168.72s)]
*  She is a pro-illegal vice president. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=173.4s)]
*  She has been doing everything she can to support these people pouring in over the border in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=176.56s)]
*  violation of the very laws that she took an oath to uphold and impacting the quality of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  life for all Americans. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  And you know, when you have a vice president who, frankly, cares so little about America [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=191.44s)]
*  that she would look in the camera and lie to us like my orcas and Biden and say everything's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=197.48s)]
*  fine at the border, she's never worked on that border issue. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=202.16s)]
*  And she was in charge of that issue. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  I've served under five presidents and the only president, the only president that did [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=206.76s)]
*  anything to bring in people like America's sheriff, sat down with us, met with us, talked [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=212.2s)]
*  to us about the things that were going on there so that when he created policy, it was [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=217.72s)]
*  going to go back and benefit the American people was President Trump. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=221.72s)]
*  They've never, Harris, Biden have never brought in the sheriffs to sit down and understand [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=225.24s)]
*  the issues and talk about how we interface with CBP and DHS. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=231.28s)]
*  They've undermined us completely with regards to ICE and with regards to CBP and our collaboration [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=236.24s)]
*  to try to protect the people of our communities across this nation. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  Sheriff Kamala Harris said at one of her rallies recently, Donald Trump doesn't want to fix [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=245.24s)]
*  this issue. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=248.96s)]
*  He talks a big game about border security, but he doesn't walk the walk. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=250.08s)]
*  Given what you just said about Donald Trump meeting directly with you, what do you think [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=254.56s)]
*  about that? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=258.44s)]
*  Well, it's not surprising. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=259.44s)]
*  Look, she's going to she's going to misrepresent the truth every step of the way. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=262.52s)]
*  President Trump worked and created policy that did make a difference. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=267.48s)]
*  And the American people can see it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=271.8s)]
*  They can see that she's really changing her tune and trying to pretend she's somebody she's [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=273.12s)]
*  not. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=278.64s)]
*  And we're not going to buy it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=279.64s)]
*  The American people are fed up. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=280.64s)]
*  They're being impacted in their neighborhoods in a very adverse way by these people pouring [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=282.20000000000005s)]
*  in by the millions. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=286.04s)]
*  And it's time for us to move in a new direction. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=287.04s)]
*  And the American people see that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq7QzpGQROU&t=289.68s)]
