# WATCH: Vandals targeting Teslas, charging stations in NYC
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc)
*  I did hear this, you guys might find this interesting. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=0.0s)]
*  In Washington DC, before the Tesla take down, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=2.44s)]
*  there's gonna be a dance party. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=5.94s)]
*  Yeah, there's gonna be a little dance. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Which I actually said that's kind of not a bad idea. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=8.36s)]
*  Well listen, no this is something that's been [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=10.56s)]
*  circulating on social media for weeks now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=12.58s)]
*  It's called hashtag Tesla take down. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=14.52s)]
*  It's this, not just nationwide, it's a global event [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=16.52s)]
*  where people are supposed to protest [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=20.28s)]
*  in front of Tesla dealerships. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=22.12s)]
*  So will this be peaceful? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=24.12s)]
*  One can only hope, but you better believe [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=26.6s)]
*  that wherever there's a Tesla dealership, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=28.479999999999997s)]
*  that police department in that town [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=30.419999999999998s)]
*  is gonna be on high alert today. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=31.84s)]
*  And it really is a mental illness. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=33.6s)]
*  I mean, the idea that you're upset about politics, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=35.54s)]
*  you're upset about something in the political world, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=38.78s)]
*  and you're gonna take it out by either stealing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=42.04s)]
*  from Whole Foods or burning a Tesla showroom. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=45.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  And think about the workers too. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=49.8s)]
*  I mean, how scared must they be? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=51.44s)]
*  I was also reading in the post this morning, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=53.56s)]
*  the NYPD, their hate crime task force is investigating [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=56.56s)]
*  after two men were caught vandalizing [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=60.0s)]
*  a Tesla cyber truck on Thursday. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=62.0s)]
*  This is exactly it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=63.300000000000004s)]
*  Guess what they wrote? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=64.64s)]
*  They wrote Nazi. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=65.48s)]
*  They carved the words Nazi and swastika [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=66.64s)]
*  into the door of a cyber truck in Brooklyn. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=69.72s)]
*  Guess who owns that cyber truck? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=72.84s)]
*  A man named Ben Homo. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=74.76s)]
*  He's Jewish, and he owns that cyber truck. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=76.12s)]
*  Imagine him waking up as a Jewish man [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=79.04s)]
*  with now the words Nazi and a swastika [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=81.2s)]
*  carved into his cyber truck. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=84.48s)]
*  They haven't caught these guys yet, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=86.8s)]
*  but if and when they do, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=88.56s)]
*  I mean, you can see the guy's face clearly. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=89.4s)]
*  But you can consider domestic terrorism. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=91.28s)]
*  They should be able to get him fast. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you can guarantee they're going to catch this guy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=94.0s)]
*  And of course, the reason they're gonna catch him [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=97.08s)]
*  is because people are taking this seriously. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=99.16s)]
*  They're not gonna let the same mistakes happen [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  that happened previously where you let this go on [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=104.04s)]
*  and it gets out of control. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=106.56s)]
*  So Elon Musk has had a series of interviews on, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=107.92s)]
*  well, it was one interview, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  they broke it into two parts on Bret Baer, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  and it was fascinating. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  So amazing. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  It was an amazing interview. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=116.44000000000001s)]
*  He was with the Doge crew, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=117.68s)]
*  but then they also did a one-on-one, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=118.72s)]
*  which we saw yesterday on Special Report. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=120.48s)]
*  And this is what Elon Musk had to say about these protests [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=123.4s)]
*  and also about Tim Walz, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=127.44s)]
*  who seems to be celebrating the demise of Tesla. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=129.44s)]
*  I think it's a little presumptuous [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=132.72s)]
*  to assume that's gonna happen. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=134.12s)]
*  But anyway, here you go. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=135.4s)]
*  It's actually disadvantageous [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=138.68s)]
*  for me to be in the government, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=140.36s)]
*  not advantageous. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=141.4s)]
*  If I wasn't in the government, I could lobby. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=143.68s)]
*  And I could push for things [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=146.08s)]
*  that are advantageous to my companies [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=149.16s)]
*  and probably get it, probably receive it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=152.4s)]
*  My companies are suffering because I'm in the government. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=156.44s)]
*  Do you think it helps sales [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  if dealerships are being firebombed? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=160.0s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  And Tesla customers are being intimidated [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=164.6s)]
*  all over the country and all over Europe. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=166.8s)]
*  Does that help Tesla? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=169.84s)]
*  I mean, you had Tim Walz, who's a huge jerk, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=172.08s)]
*  running around on stage with a Tesla stock price, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=177.68s)]
*  where the stock price had gone in half. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  And he was overjoyed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  What an evil thing to do. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=186.12s)]
*  What a creep, what a jerk. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  Like, who derives joy from that? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  And it was pointed out to him that actually, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=194.4s)]
*  Minnesota State Pension Fund [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  is a major investor in Tesla. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=200.76s)]
*  But he didn't care. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=203.92s)]
*  He was so overjoyed by Tesla stock going in half. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=204.76s)]
*  Does that sound like a good person to you? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=211.32s)]
*  So good. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=213.52s)]
*  Yeah, and then Tim Walz had to walk back [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=214.36s)]
*  because of the pension fund, and he's saying, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=217.48s)]
*  well, actually, I was just joking. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=219.76s)]
*  You guys are humorless. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=220.96s)]
*  Well, you said it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=221.88s)]
*  And I really thought that this interview [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=222.92s)]
*  that Brett Baer did with not just Elon Musk, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=225.0s)]
*  but the whole Doge team was so valuable [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=227.36s)]
*  because you see that these are really serious people. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=229.96s)]
*  I mean, the billionaire co-owner of Airbnb [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=232.68s)]
*  is a part of the Doge task force, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=235.72s)]
*  and they're doing really serious and non-controversial work, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=237.52s)]
*  like updating computer systems from the 1970s and the 1980s. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=240.96s)]
*  And the NIH has- [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  I know, right? Don't do that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=247.32s)]
*  So that's what these, you know, think about that, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=248.52s)]
*  and then look at what's on your screen right now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=251.12s)]
*  Updating computer systems and streamlining systems as well. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  It was revealed that there are 700 different IT systems. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=256.52s)]
*  And NIH, which is in charge of medical advancements, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=260.84s)]
*  and their computer systems can't even talk to each other. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=265.56s)]
*  So, you know, the flashy headlines [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=268.32s)]
*  are the slash and burn that occurred early on. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=270.88s)]
*  I think they're taking a much more streamlined [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=273.12s)]
*  and meticulous approach to what they're doing now. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=275.8s)]
*  But they're also gonna do a lot of good work [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=279.08s)]
*  that's going to advance the federal government [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=281.68s)]
*  from what it was, which was the 1970s. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=284.0s)]
*  You think about the post office in slow and, you know, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=285.96s)]
*  glacial pace that the federal government moves [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=288.6s)]
*  and make it a well-oiled machine, hopefully. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=290.6s)]
*  This is the best chance we've ever had at something like that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=294.36s)]
*  And there's no greater tell that somebody doesn't have [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=296.88s)]
*  any answer to any solution whatsoever to the problem. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  When you can't even debate the issue itself, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=303.56s)]
*  all you can do is go out here, call Elon Musk a Nazi, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=306.88s)]
*  and burn down Tesla showrooms. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=310.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=312.36s)]
*  And they offer absolutely nothing constructive. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  They're just fundamentally unserious. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=316.84s)]
*  Tim Walz is a completely unserious person. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEyiHFVylc&t=318.64s)]
