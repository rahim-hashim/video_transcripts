# 'Fox & Friends': This was the final insult
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s)
*  So it was 40, what, 49 minutes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=0.0s)]
*  It went on at 10.30. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=2.08s)]
*  He went over until well past midnight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=4.16s)]
*  And it just goes to show you, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=6.88s)]
*  they had so many references, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=8.08s)]
*  evident was it 19 references to his reelection in the- [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  The platform. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=14.44s)]
*  In the platform, so they didn't put it together. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Whoever did the run of the show, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=17.48s)]
*  they cut people out and it still went way long. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=18.72s)]
*  It was crying. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  There was no discipline at all with the speakers. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  And look, I'm sure they didn't plan on [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  putting them on at 11.30. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  I mean, eight o'clock probably wouldn't have been possible, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=29.96s)]
*  but at 11.30. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=32.0s)]
*  And then you would think that he would have the sensibility. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=33.12s)]
*  It was like, I'm not gonna have anyone watching. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=35.56s)]
*  People gotta go to bed. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=38.06s)]
*  And he just recounted his entire presidency. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=39.92s)]
*  It was so frustrating. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=43.12s)]
*  Yes, it was just a lot of past speeches combined into one. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=44.68s)]
*  And we were waiting for him. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  Then we wanted to see Jill and we wanted to see his speech [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  and I wanted to watch it all. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  I wanted to see reaction from his family members [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=55.84s)]
*  in the crowd. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=57.68s)]
*  He was hugging Kamala, he was hugging his daughter Ashley, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=58.92s)]
*  but I was slipping around to different channels [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  and Hillary Clinton spoke forever. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=64.56s)]
*  And then I'm trying to take credit for the glass ceiling [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  and for Kamala Harris. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  And then on the bottom of the screen on another network, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=72.44s)]
*  it said, next up, Chris Coons. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=74.54s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  We have to sit through Chris Coons? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=78.68s)]
*  And then it said Raphael Warnock? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=80.68s)]
*  And I'm like, what? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=82.72s)]
*  Chris Coons is ratings gold. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=84.28s)]
*  Clearly, I guess. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=85.36s)]
*  I'm like, I wanna see his farewell speech. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=86.4s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=89.68s)]
*  So the organizer said the reason it ran. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=90.68s)]
*  I was so mad. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=92.88s)]
*  He ran. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=93.96s)]
*  Too much Delaware. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=95.3s)]
*  The idea was to have him in prime time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=96.14s)]
*  Prime time is not 1128 at night, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=97.76s)]
*  but the organizers say it was because [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=100.2s)]
*  there was so much applause. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=101.92s)]
*  Here's the ultimate thing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=103.28s)]
*  Remember, Joe Biden was not gonna speak. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=105.2s)]
*  A month ago, he was not gonna speak on night one. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=107.48s)]
*  He was going to be on night four. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=110.08s)]
*  Death Valley is day one, that's what they call it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=112.24s)]
*  They had already booked all of these speakers. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=114.28s)]
*  And so they all gave their piece [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=117.8s)]
*  and it went on and on and on. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=119.68s)]
*  Didn't they cut James Taylor out? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=121.36s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=123.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was supposed to sing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=123.84s)]
*  Yeah, you've got a friend, but he's got no time. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and he's seen fire and he's seen rain. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  So, Lawrence, here's the cover of the New York Post. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=130.04s)]
*  It says, past his bedtime, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=133.48s)]
*  Dems deliver final insult by pushing [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  Biden's angry, bitter speech to midnight. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=138.16s)]
*  If folks missed it, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=141.08s)]
*  well, we got some highlights. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=143.56s)]
*  Watch this. Yeah, go ahead. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=146.96s)]
*  I've made a lot of mistakes in my career, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=149.8s)]
*  but I gave my best to you. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=153.52s)]
*  For 50 years, like many of you, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=156.08s)]
*  I've given my heart and soul to our nation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=160.72s)]
*  And I've been blessed a million times in return [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=163.4s)]
*  for the support of the American people. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  I've really been too young to be in the Senate [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=171.04s)]
*  because I wasn't 30 yet and too old to stay as president. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=174.64s)]
*  But I hope you know how grateful I am to all of you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=181.12s)]
*  I can honestly say, and I mean this from the bottom, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  give you my word as a Biden, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=188.12s)]
*  I can honestly say I'm more optimistic about the future [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=190.16s)]
*  than I was when I was elected [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=193.32s)]
*  as a 29-year-old United States Senator. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  You know, I don't, even though there were so many inaccuracies, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=197.32s)]
*  there was hatefield and many kind, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=201.88s)]
*  he still cites the Charlottesville hoax, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=204.24s)]
*  which has been debunked. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't begrudge the president. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=207.88s)]
*  He's still the president, A. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=210.24s)]
*  And number two, this is probably the final big political [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  speech of his career. Yep. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  I just wish that his party, who claims to love him, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=217.08s)]
*  the entire night we kept hearing, we love you, Joe. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=221.0s)]
*  Is this really how you treat someone that you love, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=224.44s)]
*  that dedicated his life and family to your political party, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=227.08s)]
*  and that you're going to be the president of the United States [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=231.88s)]
*  at 11 o'clock at night as the sitting president [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=234.55999999999997s)]
*  of the United States? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=237.48s)]
*  You conceal all the information about him going down the track. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=238.76s)]
*  It could happen to any of us. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=242.72s)]
*  It happens to a lot of our family members. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  But they aren't the president of the United States. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  And this party was totally comfortable with him [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  leading the party until he crumbled on the debate stage. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=251.92s)]
*  And I just don't understand, at the end of all of this, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=256.2s)]
*  the senators, Nancy Pelosi, all these cabinet members, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=260.8s)]
*  and showing their face and saying, they love him. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  We love you, Joe. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=267.2s)]
*  We support you, Joe. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=268.68s)]
*  Thank you, Joe. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=269.88s)]
*  And all of these people put all the nails in his coffin. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=271.44s)]
*  I just think that's disgusting. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=274.8s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi was holding up that sign. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=276.32s)]
*  We love Joe. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  There it is right there. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=279.32s)]
*  Some love. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=280.68s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  And so many tears last night. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=282.36s)]
*  Tim Walls, his wife was crying. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=283.92s)]
*  Jill Biden had watery eyes when Joe walked out. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=285.92s)]
*  Joe Biden was wiping tears. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=288.36s)]
*  You see when he was hugging his daughter, Ashley, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gD_zHvt7s&t=290.32s)]
