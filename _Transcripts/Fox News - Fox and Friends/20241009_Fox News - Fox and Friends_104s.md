**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI)
*  Fox News alert in Afghan national is in custody today after being accused of plotting an election day terrorist attack on the behalf of ISIS and the suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa days after the Biden Harris administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=0.0s)]
*  Crazy Afghan withdraw. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=15.68s)]
*  Brooke Sigmund has the details on that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=18.18s)]
*  Yeah, Lawrence. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=20.48s)]
*  So the FBI has been warning that an open southern border and the flow of illegal aliens into the US means potential terrorists are entering the country. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=21.98s)]
*  So the Justice Department says an Afghan citizen living in Oklahoma has been charged with plotting a terrorist attack on Election Day for ISIS. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=30.02s)]
*  Twenty seven year old Nasir Tauhidi obtained weapons and ammunition to launch this attack. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=37.62s)]
*  He arrived in the US in September 2021, just days after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=42.5s)]
*  The DOJ saying Tauhidi allegedly indicated that his attack was planned for Election Day. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  And in a post arrest interview, Tauhidi allegedly confirmed that the attack was planned for Election Day, targeting large gatherings of people during which he and the juvenile were expected to die as martyrs. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=54.1s)]
*  Former acting ICE director Tom Homan says the risk of a terror attack brought on by the lack of security at the southern border. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=66.18s)]
*  Listen, what's just scared the American people is because of what this administration has done. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=72.46s)]
*  The Harris administration. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=77.46s)]
*  How many more just like him are plotting an attack right now? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=79.05999999999999s)]
*  Luckily, this guy was caught on some chatter, but we both know the intelligence community isn't perfect. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=83.74s)]
*  They'll miss more than they get. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=89.13999999999999s)]
*  So God help us. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=90.41999999999999s)]
*  There is more than just this one in the country because of this administration. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  Now, if convicted, Tauhidi faces up to 35 years in prison. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=95.5s)]
*  Brian. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=99.25999999999999s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  But not unexpected. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=101.46s)]
*  Meanwhile. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=102.89999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Brooke. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2xtyq-QCI&t=103.33999999999999s)]
