# ‘Always bet on red’: Chiefs owners confident ahead of Super Bowl
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo)
*  I'm joined now by the way, the ownership family of the Kansas City Chiefs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=0.0s)]
*  We have Clark and Sharon Hunt and Tavia Hunt and Gracie and Ava. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  We've got not the entire family, but a good chunk of the family here this morning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=8.28s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=11.88s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=12.72s)]
*  We're so glad to be here with you today. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=13.6s)]
*  Clark, Sharon, first of all, let's show off your rings. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=15.52s)]
*  Look at these rings. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=18.32s)]
*  Are these last? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=18.92s)]
*  What year? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=19.96s)]
*  You've got so many now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=20.48s)]
*  How do you pick? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=22.0s)]
*  What are we looking at? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=22.96s)]
*  Yeah, this is the Super Bowl 58 ring. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=23.92s)]
*  And it's very special. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=26.44s)]
*  Almost too big to wear. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=28.88s)]
*  But we love it and hopefully we'll get another one on Sunday. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=31.16s)]
*  Tavia, you have to pick your chances to put that kind of jewelry on, right? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=33.44s)]
*  Like there's you can't wear that on your everyday life. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=36.44s)]
*  There's only a few occasions to put a ring on that big. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=39.32s)]
*  Well, actually, I think when you're the reigning champs, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  you just have to take every opportunity to wear it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=44.04s)]
*  And sometimes you just put all three of them on at the same time, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=46.76s)]
*  just because, you know, it feels good in the moment. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Year round, as long as you're the reigning champion. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=53.4s)]
*  People like to see them. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  They like to see how they've increased 25 percent in like four years. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=55.88s)]
*  Is that right? On the size of the ring? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=59.6s)]
*  Yeah. 25 percent growth over the years. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=61.32s)]
*  Yeah, they grow faster than our children. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, here we are, Sharon. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=65.28s)]
*  Chance for a third, a third in a row. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=67.56s)]
*  That is that is history. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=69.76s)]
*  That is a special thing that has not been done. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=71.0s)]
*  A three pete. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=73.68s)]
*  It's it's stunning. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=74.56s)]
*  And it's a wonderful thing to be a part of and a truly amazing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=75.92s)]
*  Really. So proud of our team. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=79.64s)]
*  From what I understand, Clark, you're talking to the team today. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=82.2s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=84.84s)]
*  Yes. Got a little tradition of speaking to the team at the last practice [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=85.76s)]
*  before the game. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=89.64s)]
*  Give them a little pep talk. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=91.4s)]
*  I don't think they need it, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=92.56s)]
*  but it's always something that's very special to get to do. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=94.64s)]
*  Give us a little tease. What are you going to what at this point? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  What do you have to tell Patrick Mahomes? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's nothing I can tell Patrick Mahomes to help him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  The guys are really dialed in and they're just excited about the opportunity [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=106.2s)]
*  to play tomorrow. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=110.12s)]
*  And the important thing is to focus on the moment, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  focus on the task at hand. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=114.44s)]
*  And I know the guys will do that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=116.56s)]
*  I want to ask both of you, Sharon and Clark, this question. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=118.36s)]
*  I know your family. We're all from Dallas. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  Of course, though, you're deeply connected to Kansas City. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  I was just telling everyone my boys play for FC Dallas. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  They own FC Dallas. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=130.16s)]
*  You have and your family has been involved with the Chiefs. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=131.96s)]
*  You've been involved with the NFL since its founding. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=135.28s)]
*  And you've been through in your lifetime a lot of different iterations [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=138.24s)]
*  of the Chiefs. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=141.92s)]
*  Where you sit today, though, is a unique place to be this [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=143.04s)]
*  this high on the mountain, this on top. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=147.28s)]
*  Tell me what it feels like to kind of ride that entire journey. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=149.84s)]
*  Well, we know how special this time period is for the Kansas City Chiefs. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=153.72s)]
*  When you go 50 years between Super Bowls, which we did from Super Bowl [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=158.0s)]
*  four to Super Bowl 54, it gives you an appreciation for how hard it is [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=161.72s)]
*  to get back to the big game. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=166.0s)]
*  And certainly the last six years has been incredibly special, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=167.76s)]
*  making the Super Bowl almost every year. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=171.84s)]
*  It's a real testament to Andy Reed, Patrick Mahomes, all of his teammates. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=174.16s)]
*  They're just so fantastic. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=179.8s)]
*  And I have to say, I'm so glad to see Coach Reed getting the accolades [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=181.8s)]
*  that he deserves. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=185.16s)]
*  He's been incredible. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=186.6s)]
*  Twenty five plus year career at this point. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  Over 300 wins. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  Certainly a future Hall of Fame coach. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=192.8s)]
*  What would you obviously all of you guys? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=194.88s)]
*  Gracie, I see your social media posts. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=197.36s)]
*  You're on the sidelines. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=199.16s)]
*  By the way, posting a Bible verse, I think almost every Sunday I see that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=200.52s)]
*  I think all of you have experience. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  And when I say experience, you're a part of the team. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  You are around the team. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=212.56s)]
*  What's unique about the team? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=214.12s)]
*  What's the culture of the Kansas City Chiefs? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=215.36s)]
*  Well, culture is very important. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=219.0s)]
*  And it's something that that Andy Reed helped establish [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=220.8s)]
*  when he came to Kansas City in 2013. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=224.28s)]
*  It's a it's a culture of love and respect. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  The players know that Andy, the coaching staff, the entire organization, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  care about them as people. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  Certainly their performance on the field is important. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  But Andy has a special relationship. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  He's also willing to hold them accountable. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=243.36s)]
*  And they know that as well. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  And that just permeates the team and is a big part of the reason [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=247.28000000000003s)]
*  why we're back in the big game. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=251.24s)]
*  OK, I'm going to ask this and you guys can all maybe it's a short answer. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=252.8s)]
*  OK, I don't know. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  You talked about that 50 year journey. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=257.20000000000005s)]
*  You talked about that gap in Super Bowls. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=258.72s)]
*  You talked about Andy Reed. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=260.76000000000005s)]
*  There was a moment when you felt it shift. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=262.12s)]
*  And I don't know if it was Patrick Holmes first game, his third game. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=264.68s)]
*  Obviously, I was covering sports exclusively at the time. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=268.48s)]
*  There was a moment we all realized. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=271.72s)]
*  And by the way, it wasn't when you drafted him [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=273.8s)]
*  because he would have gone first overall. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=275.36s)]
*  If everybody knew that he was going to be this guy, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=276.68s)]
*  he would have gone first overall. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  When was the moment? Do you remember like we just got Superman? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=279.6s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think it really started his first year with the team [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=283.12s)]
*  when he wasn't starting. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=286.24s)]
*  Our general manager, Brett Veach, was sending me clips of things [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=287.92s)]
*  that Patrick did in practice. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=291.16s)]
*  I remember one of them was a no look pass. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=293.52s)]
*  I was like, wait a minute, I don't know what a no look pass is in football. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=296.44s)]
*  I know what it is in basketball. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=298.92s)]
*  But sure enough, here's Patrick looking this way and throwing the ball [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=300.52s)]
*  accurately to his left, which just showed how amazing was. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=302.88s)]
*  Then when we got into 2018, I remember a game against the Chargers. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=307.0s)]
*  He hit our fullback on a wheel route. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=311.76s)]
*  There was an incredible throw. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=313.88s)]
*  A week later, we go to Pittsburgh and we traditionally had had a hard time [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=315.64s)]
*  when we go to Pittsburgh. It's a very tough place to play. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=319.2s)]
*  And Patrick had an absolute amazing day. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=321.76s)]
*  A whole bunch of touchdown throws to Travis Kelsey. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=324.4s)]
*  And it was sort of at that moment, I was like, OK, he really is that special. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=327.32s)]
*  OK, if I ask the ownership group, if I ask the family for prediction, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=330.76s)]
*  I'm going to get a predictable answer, right? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=335.52s)]
*  You're going to say it's a chief's victory. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=337.36s)]
*  But maybe you say you don't want to get out over your skis. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=339.96s)]
*  Maybe you don't want to jinx it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  Who's going to take the leap? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=343.96s)]
*  Which one of you is going to take the leap and tell me what happens tomorrow? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, I know it's going to be an incredibly competitive game. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=347.88s)]
*  It'll probably be another nail biter [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  because there are some ways the Chiefs haven't won yet. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=354.44s)]
*  Some ways that they haven't won. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=359.24s)]
*  So there's still some creative ways to come out with another ring. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=360.64s)]
*  We hope. I'm going to say [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=364.28s)]
*  it's the Chiefs, I'd like to say by a mile, because we always think, you know, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=367.44s)]
*  you can't really relax watching the game unless you're winning by five touchdowns, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=371.48s)]
*  which we don't even know what that's like anymore because every game comes down [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=375.68s)]
*  to the wire in these nail biters. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=379.32s)]
*  But I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to have the game in anybody's hands, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=382.0s)]
*  any quarterback's hands other than Patrick's. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=385.64000000000004s)]
*  Any predictions, girls? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=388.48s)]
*  I mean, you always have to bet on red. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=389.76s)]
*  What else is there to say? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=391.36s)]
*  All right. You guys have a few fingers left to still fill with those [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=393.24s)]
*  championship rings. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  Best of luck to you. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=396.88s)]
*  We appreciate everything you guys are doing in the NFL. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=398.36s)]
*  So good luck in the Super Bowl. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=400.12s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=402.2s)]
*  Clark, Sharon, Ava and Gracie Hunt here on Fox Friends. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5CKMuvF0Bo&t=404.08s)]
