# 'JUST PAINFUL': Dems ridiculed for backroom plans to woo males
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI)
*  Meanwhile, it looks like the Democrats have a problem with men. They're gonna invest 20 million with everyone [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=0.0s)]
*  They didn't do as well with the with black men last election. They didn't do as well with Latinos [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=5.54s)]
*  Everyone is going crazy on the Democratic side trying to figure out. Oh my gosh. What do we do next? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=12.08s)]
*  We don't know what to do our messaging needs to change. You have Rahm Emanuel saying we're too well [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=17.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think he might want to run for president or either the the governor of wants to run for governor [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=22.98s)]
*  So they're trying to figure out their messaging problem [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=28.98s)]
*  Apparently they're spending 20 million dollars so that they can woo the young male voters and it's caught they call it Sam [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=31.26s)]
*  And this is what the New York Times says the prospectus for one new [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=38.300000000000004s)]
*  20 million dollar effort obtained by the Times aims to reverse the erosion of Democratic support among young men [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=42.34s)]
*  Especially online it is codenamed Sam short for speaking with American men a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=48.92s)]
*  Strategic plan and promises investment to study the syntax language and con and content that gains attention [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=54.599999999999994s)]
*  And virally in these spaces it rep it recommends buying [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  Advertisements and video games among other things above all we must shift from a moralizing tone it urges [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=66.32s)]
*  Their problem is not grammar. That's not why they're losing men [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=73.02s)]
*  The reason they're losing men is because they seemed to like not like our country, which is a real problem [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=77.06s)]
*  But also just their policies their policies are terrible [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=84.12s)]
*  And if you look back at twice I always believe that 2016 was the most issue oriented election that we've ever been through [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  2024 was the only one that was more issue oriented well there they have two problems [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=95.76s)]
*  They're fake. They're not authentic at all [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  They're always trying to manufacture something to be something that they're not and the other thing they they talked to us in a way [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=103.28s)]
*  That is kind of dehumanizing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  I think I think a turning point for the Democrats when you saw President Obama tried to chastise black men and say that you have to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=111.6s)]
*  Vote for Kamala Harris meanwhile our kids are getting a quality education [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  We're living paycheck to paycheck [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=122.52s)]
*  And you still want us to vote for him and then you have have Tim walls who couldn't shoot the gun [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  But he was gonna go on the honey [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=127.88s)]
*  Couldn't load it couldn't shoot it and then you have this moment with him in AOC [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=129.88s)]
*  When they were playing Madden, and then he said exactly he called it a pick six watch [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=134.16s)]
*  You're a pro though so you can you can call these audibles [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=140.28s)]
*  Well, I think I know what these guys are doing, but I don't know which damn button to push to make my guy be a beast [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=144.08s)]
*  What I need [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=149.36s)]
*  Here we go here we go. Oh [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=151.64s)]
*  nice catch [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=155.2s)]
*  How'd you do that you get this I didn't play I spent a solid two days in the tutorials here so [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=159.4s)]
*  I was doing drills [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=169.32s)]
*  It's painful to watch so she doesn't play no exactly [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=171.2s)]
*  It's it would be really cool if both of them were really good and people and they wanted to attract that voter [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=175.56s)]
*  Then maybe those voters would say they're really two cool people that play the same game [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=180.52s)]
*  I do but it's so obvious they don't play it and they don't know what they're doing [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=184.0s)]
*  And people and people can sense the the the be a fraud they see it and they can smell it [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=187.72s)]
*  Let's put that back there because I think that context is important about the pick six. This is the quote [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=193.08s)]
*  This was on X AOC can run a mean pick six and I can call an audible play and we both know that if you take [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=197.42s)]
*  The time to drop a playbook you're gonna use them walls [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=204.42s)]
*  He had to take it down because it's not accurate [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=208.1s)]
*  Wasn't a pick six a pick six is when there's an interception that happened and then you get six points that clearly didn't happen [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=210.29999999999998s)]
*  The whole time she'd even know which button to use. He didn't know which [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=216.44s)]
*  Is just you had a bunch of staffers running the social media, right? Just be you [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=219.82s)]
*  Perfect example because you're young and you helped Barack Obama with his campaign and then you switched parties you became [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=226.2s)]
*  An independent but that's back. That's back when the Democrats were real, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=233.8s)]
*  they had young people actually running the campaign and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  Knocking on doors and talking with voters, right? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=242.36s)]
*  Then they started hiring all these consultants to do it and they're not connecting with the American people [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=244.48s)]
*  There wasn't this big Barack Obama back in a day didn't spend 20 million dollars learning how to communicate with people [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=248.8s)]
*  He was out there playing basketball. So love him or hate him love or hate Donald Trump. It's the doing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=255.0s)]
*  It's not the lecturing to people. It's not going to control Barack Obama played basketball. So he did it [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=261.32s)]
*  Donald Trump loves McDonald's. He loves going to the UFC. So he went to the game [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=266.88s)]
*  It's not really you don't need academics to tell you how to do this, you know, right? They just lost the touch [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=270.76s)]
*  Totally yeah, Donald Trump is a billionaire [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=278.2s)]
*  New York real estate magnate and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=281.0s)]
*  Appeals to people who are very different from him, but he never tries to pretend he's one of them [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  He just is who he is. That's right. He doesn't shy away from being that risk guy from New York [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0yU7L7jRI&t=289.76s)]
