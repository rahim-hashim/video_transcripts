# RFK Jr.: I didn't leave the Democratic Party, they left me
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ)
*  Amongst our guests, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is just getting dressed right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=0.0s)]
*  He wants to buy a little bit of money. Oh, he is dressed. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=3.4s)]
*  All right. He also is an independent candidate. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=5.32s)]
*  As you know, he's going to play a key role with the Trump administration [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=8.2s)]
*  should there be a Trump 2 on Tuesday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=11.48s)]
*  And should we get a verdict actually on on election night? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=14.56s)]
*  That'll be great. So Robert F. Kennedy Jr., ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=16.96s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=23.28s)]
*  So I know you've lived a lot of your life in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=24.28s)]
*  What did you make of the fact that The Washington Post announced [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=31.48s)]
*  inexplicably on Friday, we're not going to endorse a candidate. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=34.52s)]
*  And then Jeff Bezos has come out and he said, you know what? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=38.64s)]
*  We want people to decide on their own. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=40.96s)]
*  Oh, you know, The Washington Post, when I was little, did not endorse candidates. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  And it only started doing that recently. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=49.0s)]
*  The problem I have with The Washington Post is the is the bias in the newsroom. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=52.24s)]
*  Front page. Right. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=57.64s)]
*  Because traditionally you would have an unbiased reporting by The New York Times [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=59.080000000000005s)]
*  and The Washington Post, and then the editorial board would meet and vote. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=64.64s)]
*  They'd endorse a candidate and there was supposed to be a Chinese wall between them. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  In recent years, they have become blatantly partisan. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=73.48s)]
*  And I think that's a tragedy for the news because there's really, you know, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  there's there is very, very few sorts of nonpartisan news left, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  except, of course, right here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=85.52s)]
*  I think that's a good answer. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  It was a long pause. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=88.88s)]
*  How do you feel, though, about the media at large, the painting, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=89.8s)]
*  the Trump supporters that you were at that event in New York, Madison Square Garden. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=93.76s)]
*  The pain of all is Nazi supporters as racist. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=99.4s)]
*  And this used to be your party used to be the part of inclusion of open debate. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=102.48s)]
*  But that's changed. Why? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  You know, at the beginning of this campaign, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  I made a statement about Anne Frank during a speech and I was, you know, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  I wasn't referring to saying anything reminded me of Nazism. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=116.96s)]
*  I was talking about the rise of totalitarian systems of AI and facial recognition [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=121.64s)]
*  that give totalitarian systems the capacity to control so much of our behavior and to surveil us. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=127.72s)]
*  And for about five months after that, I was called an anti-Semite for, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=134.24s)]
*  you know, for invoking the Nazi era. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=139.68s)]
*  And here you have the leading Democrats in the last couple of weeks and the press. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  MSNBC has been really appalling. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=147.28s)]
*  Insane. And the vice president. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=150.8s)]
*  And there's I mean, there's no link between. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=152.96s)]
*  I don't even think Madison Square Garden existed in 1939. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=157.52s)]
*  It came in 1968 and moved to move to Penn State. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=161.44s)]
*  So they're they're invoking this 1939 meeting of Nazis. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=164.76s)]
*  And they're saying that somehow this is a reunion. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=169.04s)]
*  And you go in that, you know, there was a joke made during made during the speech by one comedian. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  And the crowd, I was in the crowd at that time and they groaned. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=182.76s)]
*  These were not, you know, they were. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=186.28s)]
*  No one was laughing. Nobody was laughing. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=188.28s)]
*  And there was so much joy in the room and optimism and patriotism and idealism about our country. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=190.64s)]
*  And it was the opposite of Nazism and a the need to point to use that most evocative and explosive [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=196.11999999999998s)]
*  and incendiary and poisonous reference. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=204.44s)]
*  And it's being used across the top ranks, the Democratic Party, it's Hillary Clinton, it's Kamala. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=209.04s)]
*  I think it's really bad for our country. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=216.04s)]
*  And by the way, so many of us, when we were kids in this country, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=218.32s)]
*  we're we're we're asked to answer to consider the moral quandary. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=223.4s)]
*  Would you if you could go back in time, would you kill baby Hitler before he could do all the damage? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=228.56s)]
*  And most of us answer, yeah, we would do that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=234.6s)]
*  So when you compare an American political figure to Hitler, who was about to become president, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  you know, the kind of people who are, you know, who are already a little unstable, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=244.4s)]
*  you're you're really suggesting to them that this man should be killed before he gets into office. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=251.8s)]
*  President President Trump brought that up yesterday because he's going to get me shot again. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=257.36s)]
*  And he goes, when I was younger, my dad told me never bring up that word Nazi in my house. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=260.72s)]
*  And now I'm being called it. And he said, you're going to get me shot again. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=266.0s)]
*  Right. By the way, they did a study. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=269.24s)]
*  They said how many people have a great deal, if not a fair amount of trust in the media? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=271.16s)]
*  Only 31 percent said yes, they trust the media. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=275.24s)]
*  That was at 40 percent in 2012. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=279.44s)]
*  But it used to be over 70 percent. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=281.44s)]
*  When my uncle was president was 85 percent. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  Eighty five. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=285.68s)]
*  When you had Walter Cronkite and people, you know, people like that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=287.08s)]
*  And the media is really focused on telling the truth to the American public. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=290.56s)]
*  When your uncle was president, six percent of Americans had chronic disease. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=294.08s)]
*  Now it's 60 at a zero to that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=298.12s)]
*  You've talked a lot about this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=300.92s)]
*  You walked in here and you gave everyone in the audience these Make America Healthy Again hats. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=302.08s)]
*  As a mom, as Americans, we appreciate what you're doing because we're getting older and we're thinking about [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=306.2s)]
*  we want to live a long life. We want to see our grandchildren. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=311.56s)]
*  I want to see my grandchildren walk down the aisle. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=315.08s)]
*  You go to Europe and you might eat pizza in Italy and you don't feel bad and you don't gain weight. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=317.48s)]
*  We want to know why that happens here in America and what you're going to do. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=323.12s)]
*  But first, let's play the soundbite. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=326.44s)]
*  This is Donald Trump at the rally at MSG. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=327.96s)]
*  Look, we're not going to let him go too crazy, Elon, with the oil and gas stuff and, you know, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=331.88s)]
*  because Robert F. Kennedy cares more about human beings and health and the environment than anybody. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=336.76s)]
*  And he's going to be absolutely... [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=346.12s)]
*  Having him is such a great honor. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=349.0s)]
*  I've been friends of his for a long time. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=351.2s)]
*  And I'm going to let him go wild on health. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=353.84s)]
*  I'm going to let him go wild on the food. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=357.04s)]
*  I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=359.12s)]
*  The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=362.92s)]
*  Who's your reaction to that? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=370.52s)]
*  Well, he always says that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=372.8s)]
*  I mean, I get it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=374.48s)]
*  But, you know, what he's right is we have the sickest children in the world right now. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=378.96s)]
*  There's nobody in the world that has that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=384.24s)]
*  When I was a kid, the autism rate among American children and in 70 year old men today, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=386.12s)]
*  in my generation, is one in 10,000. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=392.4s)]
*  In my children's generation, that's one in every 34 kids, one in every 22 boys. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=395.44s)]
*  And the diabetes, a typical physician when I was a kid would see one case of juvenile diabetes [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=400.8s)]
*  in his lifetime or 40 or 50 year career. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=408.36s)]
*  Today, one out of every three kids who walks through his office or is diabetic or pre-diabetic. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=411.52000000000004s)]
*  And it's costing us $4.3 trillion a year. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=416.92s)]
*  It costs zero for we paid zero for chronic disease when my uncle was president. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=420.64000000000004s)]
*  Today is the biggest expense, five times our military budget. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=425.0s)]
*  It's easy to fix. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  We have a thousand ingredients in our foods that are illegal in Italy and other countries in Europe. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=430.52000000000004s)]
*  And the reason for that is corruption. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=436.32s)]
*  At the food industry and the agriculture, big agricultural producers control FDA. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=439.12s)]
*  And so they're not worried about public health. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  They're worried about advancing the mercantile interests of those corporations. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=447.68s)]
*  And they've let them do things. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=452.08s)]
*  You know, the companies, the big cereal companies make two kinds of cereals. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=454.36s)]
*  Like Fruit Loops in our country is just loaded with chemicals and food dyes that are carcinogenic, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=459.79999999999995s)]
*  that they're going to cause ADHD in your kids. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=466.76s)]
*  If you go across the border to Canada or to Europe, you have the same product, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=470.68s)]
*  but it has no dyes. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=475.32s)]
*  It has good ingredients. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=476.36s)]
*  So these companies know how to do it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=477.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=479.96s)]
*  If they can get away with it here. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=480.68s)]
*  Do you know how you'd approach fixing it? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=482.24s)]
*  I wouldn't talk that I want you to answer that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=483.8s)]
*  But first, I want you to go to the studio audience. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=485.48s)]
*  James, you're over there. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=488.2s)]
*  You have a question for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. Thank you so much for just taking our questions and being here. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=492.48s)]
*  But we all know that access to healthy foods is not always easy or affordable for many. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=495.76s)]
*  What are some ways that you hope to change this? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=500.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=503.64s)]
*  Well, first, I would say that you cannot afford to eat bad food because it's going to affect your health [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=504.56s)]
*  and you're going to pay later on. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=511.24s)]
*  And, you know, with food we can cause, we can solve the diabetes crisis. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=513.04s)]
*  Most people who have diabetes or pre-diabetic can be cured with good food. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=519.04s)]
*  And if they choose instead to be cured by Ozempic, the government then pays $1,500 a month for the rest of their lives. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=524.68s)]
*  And with a fraction of that, we could give everybody organic foods three meals a day in this country. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=533.8s)]
*  What I would do is, you know, the first thing I do isn't going to cost you anything because I'm just going to tell the cereal companies to take all the dyes out of their food. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=540.92s)]
*  It seems pretty inevitable. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=551.56s)]
*  I'm going to tell the same cereal companies. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=552.56s)]
*  President Trump was cooking McDonald's the other day and giving people french fries. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=558.04s)]
*  And people criticized me and they said, well, you know, he's out there giving fast food. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=564.04s)]
*  And I said, I don't have anything against fast food. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=570.04s)]
*  I have, I'm against food that has seed oils. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=573.04s)]
*  When I was a kid, McDonald's was made with tallow fat. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=576.64s)]
*  That was good for you. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=580.72s)]
*  And your body needs that. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=581.72s)]
*  It makes you healthy. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=583.72s)]
*  Why aren't we making with tallow fat again? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=584.72s)]
*  You know, in England, McDonald's has a McDonald's french fry has three ingredients in it like potato, sugar and some oil or tallow. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=586.72s)]
*  Yeah, salt. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=600.72s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=601.72s)]
*  Potatoes, salt and some tallow fat. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=602.72s)]
*  In our country, it has 17 ingredients. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=606.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=609.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, and they're none of them are good for you. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=610.8000000000001s)]
*  OK, well, obviously something's got to give. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  Lynn right in the front row. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=615.8000000000001s)]
*  R.F.K. has got a question for you. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  Lynn. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=619.8000000000001s)]
*  Hi, I grew up a Bostonian with a Kennedy name is Sank Pro-Sanked. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  How did you get the courage to stand up against the liberal media and your famous family? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=627.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, I, I, you know, I was I was led one thing to another. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=634.88s)]
*  I saw what the truth was happening to our kids and I had to make a choice between whether I was going to do you know, whether I was going to try to help people get healthy again. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=643.88s)]
*  And then there were other reasons that I left the Democratic Party. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=654.88s)]
*  I you know, the party that I grew up with was the Party of Peace. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=657.88s)]
*  It was the party of constitutional rights and civil rights. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=661.96s)]
*  It was the party of that stood up to Wall Street and the big corporations. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=664.96s)]
*  Today's Democratic Party is the party of war. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=670.96s)]
*  It's the party of censorship. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=673.96s)]
*  It's the party of surveillance. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=675.96s)]
*  It's the party of big tech, big ag, big banking, the military industrial complex and and big ag, big food and big pharma. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=676.96s)]
*  And so I didn't leave the Democratic Party. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=687.0400000000001s)]
*  The Democratic Party left. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=690.0400000000001s)]
*  You tried to run as a Democrat and they locked you out. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  They wouldn't put you on the ballot. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=693.0400000000001s)]
*  We have one more question. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=697.0400000000001s)]
*  Where's Chanel? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=698.0400000000001s)]
*  Is Chanel on this side of the room? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=699.0400000000001s)]
*  Hey, Chanel, what is your question? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=701.0400000000001s)]
*  About 100,000 schools participate in the USDA's national lunch program during the year. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=704.0400000000001s)]
*  If you're given a position by the Trump administration in the agricultural department, what will you do to improve school lunches? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=710.12s)]
*  I'll get processed food out of school lunch immediately. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=717.12s)]
*  About half the school lunch program goes to processed food. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=721.12s)]
*  About 70 percent of food stamps go to processed food. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=725.12s)]
*  Ten percent of food stamps go to sugar drinks, to you know, soda. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=730.12s)]
*  We're creating diabetes problem in our our kids. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=735.12s)]
*  I giving them food that's poison and I'm going to stop that. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=739.2s)]
*  Robert, we gotta let you go. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=742.2s)]
*  You're talking about the difference from the McDonald's here versus another country or the Froot Loops here versus another country. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=745.2s)]
*  What's the reason why? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=752.2s)]
*  Like if they know how to make it already, why aren't we doing it? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=754.2s)]
*  It's because it's cheaper for them to put the chemicals. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=757.2s)]
*  And President Trump wants to get the chemicals out. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=761.2s)]
*  And he's you know, he wants to make it healthy because in the long run that's cheaper for a country. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=764.2s)]
*  It's America. America is the best at everything. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=768.2800000000001s)]
*  We need to be the best at food too. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=771.2800000000001s)]
*  There you go. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=773.2800000000001s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, RKJr. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GlV1MVUwnQ&t=774.2800000000001s)]
