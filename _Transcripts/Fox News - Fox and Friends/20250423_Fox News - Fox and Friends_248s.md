# Musk reveals future at DOGE as Tesla profits plummet
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w)
*  Ultimately, one company that has reported their earnings, first quarter earnings, yesterday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=0.0s)]
*  was Tesla. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  And Tesla, the stock is now up, but yesterday their net income was announced. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=7.08s)]
*  It's down 71 percent. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=13.0s)]
*  And Elon Musk even said he admitted that Tesla faced a lot of blowback from his ties to Donald [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  And now he's talking, and we're going to play a little snippet of it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  He says, you know what, maybe I better go back to the car company because they need me. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=26.32s)]
*  Starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to do it will drop significantly. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=32.44s)]
*  So I think I'll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=44.28s)]
*  long as the president would like me to do so. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=53.04s)]
*  And as long as it is useful. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=55.88s)]
*  But starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=58.36s)]
*  And now that the major work we're establishing, the development of government efficiency is [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=66.12s)]
*  done, you know, there are some challenges and I expect that this year will be, it can [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=72.44s)]
*  follow me some unexpected bumps this year. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=80.44s)]
*  I remain extremely optimistic about the future of the company. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=85.84s)]
*  So investors are happy to hear that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=89.0s)]
*  Hoping he's going to refocus his efforts on Tesla. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  He's saying it's because political sentiment, he thinks, and the uncertainty in the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=95.16s)]
*  automotive and energy markets. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=98.32s)]
*  But he has some plans coming up. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=99.96s)]
*  He's on track to launch this robo taxi business out of Austin, Texas, within the next few [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=101.56s)]
*  months. And then he said the second half of next year, 2026, he's going to have millions [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=107.12s)]
*  of Teslas operating fully autonomously. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=112.28s)]
*  So there's the self-driving Tesla. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  And the other thing is robots. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=118.36s)]
*  He's got the Tesla robots rolling out. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=120.2s)]
*  And if you see some of this video, the robots are more athletic than us. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=122.0s)]
*  I mean, they can go down a mountain, they could do a Tough Mudder. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=127.2s)]
*  So and I and I need somebody that understands me. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=130.28s)]
*  And I'm hoping that this robot could be one of the people. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=133.44s)]
*  That's why when you would watch the Jetsons back in the day, you identified with Rosie. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  Right. Absolutely. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=140.11999999999998s)]
*  Rosie, Rosie, the robot, the housekeeper. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=142.0s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=145.2s)]
*  Did a great job. She had wheels. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  The robotic housekeeper. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=147.56s)]
*  Didn't she have wheels? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  That would, would, would, Elon Musk has feet. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=149.44s)]
*  Right. Okay. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=153.44s)]
*  Like, you know, and also what was the lost in space robot? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  The worst robot ever to be lost in space with. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=157.72s)]
*  Remember? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  Robot. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=163.64s)]
*  A number name? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=163.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=164.88s)]
*  It was just a robot and had arms like on danger. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=165.11999999999998s)]
*  Danger. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=168.0s)]
*  Will Robinson. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  It was really, it was a bad robot. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  Made you not want to know that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  Elon did not build that one. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=172.55999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=173.92s)]
*  No, Elon, Tesla did say one thing about the tariffs yesterday. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=174.16s)]
*  And they said that the tariffs are making its energy storage business. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=179.32s)]
*  It's, it's impacting them harder because obviously they need the rare earth, the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=184.67999999999998s)]
*  rare minerals to make the batteries and stuff like that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=188.88s)]
*  Musk told, Musk even told the president, look, tariffs are a bad idea, but Musk [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  also supports the president. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  He's got a different vision and they're going through with it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  But it's just going to make making batteries more complicated. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=202.08s)]
*  Just no noted member that Elon Musk is going to donate money and Donald Trump [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=205.52s)]
*  is going to do whatever he wants. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  No, Howard Lutnick would be the treasury secretary if he had, if you listen to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk, Elon Musk didn't want the tariffs, but he respects that he's not [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=214.36s)]
*  the president and I would say this, there's gotta be like 10 major items. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  For national security that when this trade war is over, we just have to bring [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=221.44000000000003s)]
*  it back and rare earths is another, we have to be able to refine it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=225.24s)]
*  We've got to be able to do it because China will hold this over our heads in [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  any conflict, military or economic, unless we start doing it ourselves. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-U9CQGtV4w&t=232.48000000000002s)]
