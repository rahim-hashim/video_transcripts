# Top Democrat warns ICE: 'This is a red line'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk)
*  A Republican proposal looking to strip these New Jersey Democrats from their House committee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=0.0s)]
*  assignments after attempting to storm an ICE facility last week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=4.38s)]
*  The bill calling the behavior, quote, an assault on our brave ICE agents and undermining the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=8.82s)]
*  rule of law. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=13.68s)]
*  Co-anchor of American Newsroom, co-host of the 5 Day No Parino joins us now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=15.02s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=19.62s)]
*  I get what they're trying to do with the, I guess, legislation. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=20.62s)]
*  But isn't it quite just simple if they committed a crime, charge them with assault or obstruction? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=24.46s)]
*  So I can understand there needing to be a punishment, right? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=29.24s)]
*  But until it's adjudicated, until like, if they broke the law and there's charges, then [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=32.18s)]
*  I think the next step is, okay, now maybe you're stripped of your committee assignment. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=36.96s)]
*  But I also think that these Democrats, they're wanting to get arrested. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=40.46s)]
*  They want the attention. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=44.72s)]
*  They want the ability to say, they want to say to their constituents, I did something, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=45.84s)]
*  but there's something else they really want. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=49.36s)]
*  Name recognition and small dollar donations to their campaigns. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=51.66s)]
*  And that's one of the things that they can get. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=55.56s)]
*  The congressman who is putting this forward is running for Senate in Georgia against John [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  Ossoff. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=63.31999999999999s)]
*  Some people might not know him very well, but something like this can put him to the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=64.72s)]
*  front of the field. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=68.08s)]
*  I was surprised by this reaction to this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=69.08s)]
*  Chad Pergram asked, Hikim Jeffries, the minority leader, his response to all this happening, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=71.64s)]
*  this is what he had to say. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=77.56s)]
*  What happens if they were to go and arrest these members or if they would try to sanction [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=79.8s)]
*  them during the House of Representatives? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=83.84s)]
*  They'll find out. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=85.4s)]
*  It's a red line. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=86.4s)]
*  It's pretty clear. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=87.4s)]
*  First of all, I think that the so-called Homeland Security spokesperson is a joke. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=88.4s)]
*  And so there are clear lines that they just dare not cross. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=95.12s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, first of all, I hate when people say so-called. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  She is called the spokesperson. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=107.28s)]
*  That is her title. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=108.92s)]
*  She earned the title. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=109.92s)]
*  She has the job. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=110.92s)]
*  You can disagree with her. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=111.92s)]
*  But when you see the video and you see ICE agents being aggressively pushed and physically [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=113.92s)]
*  touched, he's talking about a red line. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=119.72s)]
*  That's the line. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=123.68s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=124.68s)]
*  But again, I also say that this facility has been open since 2014. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=125.68s)]
*  No one ever went to visit it until all of a sudden, I do think they want to get arrested [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=130.32s)]
*  and maybe they should be. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=133.96s)]
*  And those charges go forward. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=135.36s)]
*  Then I do think the committee assignment, that's up for grabs. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=137.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, more news on the Biden front. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=141.36s)]
*  It looks like it's the gift that keeps on giving. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=143.44000000000003s)]
*  Apparently, according to the book, he forgot his national security advisor, Jake Sullivan's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=145.52s)]
*  name, and Kate Bedingfield, who ran his campaign. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  This was revealed in the new book. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=153.84s)]
*  Why won't they just all just come out and just be honest about it? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=156.68s)]
*  Well, one of the things is that you see in this book, they have over 200 sources. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=162.84s)]
*  But they're all anonymous. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=163.84s)]
*  And the reason is not that they're worried that the Bidens or the Democrats are going [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=164.84s)]
*  But because things that they said publicly will turn out not to be true. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=169.0s)]
*  That's why they want to remain anonymous. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=175.84s)]
*  But does it even hold anyway? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=177.12s)]
*  Because we already know that they lied. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=179.2s)]
*  We know all of them lied. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=181.34s)]
*  And until they deal with it, they're not going to be able to move past them. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=182.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=184.96s)]
*  Until you actually deal with any big problem. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=185.96s)]
*  Until you actually deal with the root cause of the problem, you will not be able to move [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=187.96s)]
*  forward. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=192.12s)]
*  It's probably not a great idea. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=193.12s)]
*  In fact, you might call it an existential threat if the president of the United States [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=194.12s)]
*  cannot recognize his national security adviser. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=198.12s)]
*  One time I mistook Jake Sullivan and Jake Sherman, who writes for PunchPoll News, and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=200.4s)]
*  I demanded that Jake Sherman must testify. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=207.12s)]
*  But I'm not the president. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=209.0s)]
*  I'm not in charge of anything. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=210.36s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=211.36s)]
*  You're not getting briefed by the national security adviser every single day. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=212.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, newsrooms coming up. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=215.32s)]
*  Top of the hour. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=217.12s)]

*  Yes, we have Kellyanne Conway, which of course she's crowd favorite. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=219.12s)]
*  We have Senator John Kennedy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9fSEud-htk&t=221.8s)]
