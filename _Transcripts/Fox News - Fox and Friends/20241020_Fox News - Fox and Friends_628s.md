# 'DOING GOD'S WORK': Pro-life students allegedly mocked, thrown out of Harris rally
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY)
*  We remember Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=0.0s)]
*  with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade and they did as [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=7.0s)]
*  he intended. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=16.0s)]
*  Christ is King, Jesus is Lord. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=17.0s)]
*  Oh, you guys are at the wrong rally. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=20.0s)]
*  No, I think you meant to go to the smaller one down the street. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=30.0s)]
*  All right, so that moment we brought to you yesterday. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=40.0s)]
*  Today we'd like to bring in those students who yelled that out to Kamala Harris, two [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=46.0s)]
*  pro-life students at the University of Wisconsin-LaCrosse, both juniors. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=50.0s)]
*  Luke Pulaski and Grant Beth join us now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=54.0s)]
*  Luke, Grant, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=58.0s)]
*  Luke, I'll start with you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=60.0s)]
*  Just take us into that moment. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=62.0s)]
*  What happened yesterday? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=63.0s)]
*  We see the video clip. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=65.0s)]
*  Is there any more you can tell us about what you guys had to say and what happened afterwards [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=66.0s)]
*  from that video? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=70.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=71.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's great to be here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=73.0s)]
*  I would say the first thing I want to bring up, this is our first time taking an interview [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=75.0s)]
*  with anybody and I think it's important because this is our raw, like, untold story. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=80.0s)]
*  There's a lot that happened off camera that we said at the protest and, well, while we [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=84.0s)]
*  were protesting. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=90.0s)]
*  And I guess we could start off with when she, after she talked about overturning Roe v. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=92.0s)]
*  Wade and Donald Trump, I yelled out to the crowd that abortion is the sacrament of Satan. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=96.0s)]
*  And when I said that, I deeply do believe that as a Christian. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=102.0s)]
*  And about 10 seconds go by and that's when the video of my friend Grant and I, we were [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=106.0s)]
*  proclaiming that Christ is Lord and Jesus is King when we said that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=112.0s)]
*  And I think it's important to say this is a small venue and we're about 20 to 30 yards away from [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=118.0s)]
*  Kamala at this point. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=124.0s)]
*  There's a lot of controversy that says she wasn't talking to us or we left, we didn't get kicked [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=126.0s)]
*  out. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=130.0s)]
*  Well, I can speak on Grant's behalf on video. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=132.0s)]
*  Grant's getting pushed and shoved. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=136.0s)]
*  And there's about five seconds after or before she tells us to go to the smaller rally down the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=138.0s)]
*  street. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=144.0s)]
*  You can see on the video she waves, she was actually waving to me. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=146.0s)]
*  I took this cross off my neck that I wear. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=150.0s)]
*  And as we were getting asked to leave, I held it up in the air and waved at her and pointed to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=152.0s)]
*  her and she looked directly in the eye, kind of gave me an evil smirk. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=158.0s)]
*  And yeah, I just want to clear that up and confirm that she 100% was talking to us. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=162.0s)]
*  And there's other controversy that says we left. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=168.0s)]
*  We were getting shouted at, pushed, assaulted, screamed at. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=172.0s)]
*  So we were walking away. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=176.0s)]
*  But there was about three attendees there, volunteers that kicked us out with badges or [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=178.0s)]
*  whatever they had. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=184.0s)]
*  And I specifically remember this one man saying you were uninvited and unwelcome to this event. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=186.0s)]
*  You need to leave. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=190.0s)]
*  And all they did was walk us out the door. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=192.0s)]
*  They didn't tell us why. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=194.0s)]
*  No cops escorted us out. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=196.0s)]
*  No secret service. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=198.0s)]
*  And yeah, that's our story. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=200.0s)]
*  So where was this event held exactly? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=202.0s)]
*  This was held in our University of La Crosse's gym. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=204.0s)]
*  So did you pay tuition to go to the university? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=208.0s)]
*  I do pay tuition to go to the school, but this was a free event. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=212.0s)]
*  This is in a really small venue. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=218.0s)]
*  They only said there was about 2,500 people there, which when she told us to go to a smaller rally [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=220.0s)]
*  down the street, I didn't really think that for a political rally there could be smaller than 2,500 people. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=224.0s)]
*  But you were allowed to be there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=230.0s)]
*  You paid to be there. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=232.0s)]
*  Yes, correct. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=234.0s)]
*  Grant, I want to get your point of view from there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=236.0s)]
*  So is there anything you want to add to Luke's story? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=238.0s)]
*  And what did it feel like? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=240.0s)]
*  I mean, she basically said, you said, or Grant said something about, or Luke said something about Jesus, right? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=242.0s)]
*  Jesus is King. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=248.0s)]
*  Jesus is Lord. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=250.0s)]
*  And she said, you're not welcome here. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=252.0s)]
*  I want to know what you felt in that moment and if there's anything you want to add to his story. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=254.0s)]
*  First of all, thank you, Rachel. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=258.0s)]
*  Thank you, Will. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=260.0s)]
*  Thank you, Charlie, for having us. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=262.0s)]
*  You know, we're very blessed to be here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=264.0s)]
*  We're very blessed to speak on the national stage. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=266.0s)]
*  It's important that we get our message out in any way possible. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=268.0s)]
*  First of all, we didn't really intend on, you know, going at any people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=272.0s)]
*  People online were calling us mega fascists. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=278.0s)]
*  That was never our intention, going to this rally. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=282.0s)]
*  We were only here to protest our faith, and we did so. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=286.0s)]
*  We never expected this to grow as large as it was. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=290.0s)]
*  Essentially, she was speaking and we decided to say Christ is King, Jesus is Lord. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=294.0s)]
*  And we got a lot of backlash. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=300.0s)]
*  As you can see in that firsthand video, I was pushed by an elderly woman. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=304.0s)]
*  We were heckled at. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=310.0s)]
*  We were cursed at. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=312.0s)]
*  We were mocked. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=314.0s)]
*  And that's the biggest thing for me personally. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=316.0s)]
*  In reflection of the event, Jesus was mocked. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=318.0s)]
*  His disciples were mocked. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=324.0s)]
*  And that's okay. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=328.0s)]
*  In reality, we did God's work and we were there for the right reasons. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=330.0s)]
*  And God is watching us in this moment. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=336.0s)]
*  You know, I'm all about being a core little person, no matter your beliefs. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=340.0s)]
*  But I do believe that we were sent there by God. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=346.0s)]
*  And I do believe this timing, you know, 18 days before the election, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=352.0s)]
*  is imperative for young Americans and first-time voters like myself to understand that this is what you are going to get with a Kamala Harris presidency. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=358.0s)]
*  You are going to get the Kamala Harris that alienates over 50% of the U.S. population that is Christian. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=370.0s)]
*  You're going to get the Kamala Harris that skips the Al Smith Memorial Dinner that no major presidential candidate has skipped since, I believe, Walter Mondale in 1984. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=378.0s)]
*  Over, you know, now over 40 years ago, I'm a 20-year-old man. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=394.0s)]
*  That's double my life. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=400.0s)]
*  So that's a long time for someone not to attend that event. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=402.0s)]
*  That, along with our experience on this day, it's a good storm for the opposition. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=406.0s)]
*  And it just proves what type of person Kamala is and what type of leader she will be. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=414.0s)]
*  I'd love to ask you this question out of my own curiosity. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=420.0s)]
*  I'll put it to you. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=423.0s)]
*  And I know it's a difficult question because I'm asking you to put yourself in the mind or experience of someone else, meaning that person could be Kamala Harris. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=424.0s)]
*  But when she responded that way to you, you and Grant, I'm curious what she understood about you. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=431.0s)]
*  Like, what had you made clear that you were a protester, that you were pro-life? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=438.0s)]
*  We all hear you say Christ is King, Jesus is Lord. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=444.0s)]
*  Did she understand your message? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=447.0s)]
*  I want to know specifically what she is rejecting. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=450.0s)]
*  I know you can't know because you weren't in her mind, but you can know what did you make clear. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=453.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=460.0s)]
*  So I said Jesus is Lord due to the abortion Roe v. Wade she was talking about, which me and many Christians around the world disagree with, with her stance on abortion. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=461.0s)]
*  And we wanted to kind of send in a message that, you know, as Christians, at least me and grants, we don't accept or agree with her abortion policies and that we believe that Jesus is Lord and that he has the final say in everything we do. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=473.0s)]
*  And it's something we center our life around. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=493.0s)]
*  So I guess we wanted her to know that. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=495.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=499.0s)]
*  And I think you guys are two really brave boys. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=500.0s)]
*  They don't call it the People's Republic of Madison for nothing. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=503.0s)]
*  You guys went right into the lion's den and you are brave and courteous, as I can see right here. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=506.0s)]
*  And I just really admire you. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=514.0s)]
*  And I just want you to know that I think your message is resonating and very wise young men. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=516.0s)]
*  And you'll never get an apology from the Kamala Harris campaign. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=522.0s)]
*  But I hope you get an apology from the university because you had every right to be there. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTyuVKJG0hY&t=526.0s)]
