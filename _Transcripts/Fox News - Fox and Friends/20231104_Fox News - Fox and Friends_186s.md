# America is ‘flat broke’ in terms of military readiness, US general warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=0.0s)]
*  You're looking live at the Gaza Strip, as Israeli forces continue their ground push [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=1.6s)]
*  into Hamas strongholds. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=6.44s)]
*  And Prime Minister Netanyahu says they don't plan on pressing pause anytime soon. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=9.16s)]
*  Retired Air Force Brigadier General Rob Spaulding joins us now to react. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=15.0s)]
*  General, thanks for being here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=19.56s)]
*  America's—our secretary of state is trying to push a pause. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=21.72s)]
*  I don't know the difference between a pause or a ceasefire. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  But you're speaking at Netanyahu says they will continue. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=29.48s)]
*  What's your take on the situation right now? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=31.4s)]
*  Well, I think any pause is going to lead to further Israeli deaths. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=33.52s)]
*  Either it's going to lead to more troops getting killed during the invasion when they [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=37.8s)]
*  eventually do invade, or it's going to lead to more Israelis getting killed because Hamas [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=41.72s)]
*  thinks they can get away with it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=45.96s)]
*  So I don't think it benefits the civilians in Gaza because Hamas really doesn't care [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=47.56s)]
*  about them anyway. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=53.72s)]
*  So I think they're just using the time to really get prepared to kill more Israelis. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  So, I mean, in your mind, as far as operational tempo is concerned, Israel's got to keep [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=59.0s)]
*  going, keep pressing on the ground if they want to maintain the momentum? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=64.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=68.04s)]
*  And I think they need to take defensive, and they need to actually rid Gaza of Hamas. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=69.04s)]
*  And we should be supporting that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=74.4s)]
*  I don't think we should be advocating a pause at all. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=75.76s)]
*  We wouldn't be pausing if this was us. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=78.8s)]
*  Why are we advocating for a pause, then, General? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=82.76s)]
*  What's this all about? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=86.44s)]
*  Well, I think it's part of the propaganda effort that not just Hamas is putting forth, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=87.48s)]
*  but also Iran, China, Russia. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=93.52s)]
*  If you look at it, there's a full court press, you know, and they're basically blasting our [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=96.2s)]
*  university systems with this message over things like TikTok. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=101.84s)]
*  So, you know, I think the administration is feeling this false sense of pressure. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=106.2s)]
*  It shouldn't feel any pressure whatsoever because we shouldn't care about what those [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=111.08s)]
*  people think. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=114.32s)]
*  No, we shouldn't, but it also includes the House of Representatives and a massive rally [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=115.72s)]
*  that's going to happen in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=119.63999999999999s)]
*  Would you change anything? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=123.0s)]
*  Militarily, is the U.S. posture correct right now? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=124.44s)]
*  Forget the statements about pauses, but as far as positioning of forces? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=127.96s)]
*  Well, I think we've done all we can do. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=133.6s)]
*  The problem, quite frankly, is we've spent so many munitions in Ukraine. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=135.48s)]
*  We are—we're worn out. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=139.6s)]
*  You know, our military was already worn out from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=141.08s)]
*  Now Ukraine, now this. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=145.92s)]
*  We don't have munitions. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=147.64s)]
*  We are just basically flat broke in terms of, you know, our readiness in the military. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=148.98s)]
*  So we've done what we can. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=154.68s)]
*  Flat broke as it pertains to readiness in our military. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=157.76s)]
*  I've heard the same thing, General, and when you get yourself overextended and out of ammo, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=160.76s)]
*  that's a bad place to be. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=166.0s)]
*  Rob's holding, and then you have bad leadership at the Pentagon and the White House, too. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=168.44s)]
*  Thank you, sir. Appreciate your time. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=174.2s)]
*  You got it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSxnrwqKhcg&t=174.7s)]
