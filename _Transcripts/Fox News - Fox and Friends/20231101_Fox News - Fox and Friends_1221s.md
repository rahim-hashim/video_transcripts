# Today's Top Headlines | Wednesday, Nov. 1
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM)
*  Israel continuing to target Hamas hotspots, striking 11,000 terror hubs since the war started. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=0.0s)]
*  11,000! But the ground fighting is coming with a very heavy toll, Lawrence. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=8.0s)]
*  So within the last 30 minutes, the IDF announcing 11 of their soldiers were killed last night in northern Gaza. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=15.0s)]
*  That brings the Israeli soldier death toll to 13ings. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=21.0s)]
*  Well, Trey Yngst is live in southern Israel with the very latest, Trey. We've gone to you every morning. This is day 26. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=25.0s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys, good morning. Day 26 of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=33.0s)]
*  You can hear the fighter jets overhead. We've been watching as the Israelis continue airstrikes against the Strip. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=40.0s)]
*  I do want to start with some new information here though. Yesterday, amid a very chaotic day for the Israeli military, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=45.0s)]
*  I met again with Yoav Galant, the country's defense minister in Tel Aviv to discuss the situation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=51.0s)]
*  And he gave a small group of journalists some new information about the October 7th massacre and how this war began. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=57.0s)]
*  And he says the defense establishment has set up a special operation room to identify all of the Hamas militants [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=64.0s)]
*  and all of the Palestinians that participated in the massacre. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=70.0s)]
*  And they are using this operation room to ultimately hunt down each and every one of them and kill anyone who was involved [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=75.0s)]
*  in the slaughter of these innocent people in southern Israel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=82.0s)]
*  He says that they crossed a red line that day and that the Israeli forces actually blocked them from entering the southern city of Ashkelon, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=85.0s)]
*  a major city where the casualty rate would have been even higher than the 1400 that were killed in that deadly, deadly attack. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=92.0s)]
*  We are learning more about the situation though inside Gaza today. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=100.0s)]
*  And as you can hear that outgoing artillery in the distance, Israeli media is reporting 13 soldiers were killed yesterday. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=104.0s)]
*  The Israeli military in the process of notifying the families. And we do know that some soldiers will even be buried today. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=111.0s)]
*  Their fellow soldiers are operating inside Gaza behind me. It is difficult street to street fighting that's taking place. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=117.0s)]
*  But we do know the Israelis are using their air force to target other senior Hamas leadership. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=124.0s)]
*  Just yesterday, Ibrahim Bayeri, the senior commander of the Jabariah Battalion from Hamas was killed in an Israeli airstrike. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=129.0s)]
*  Though the Israelis today are facing new questions about how many civilians were in the area and how many died as a result of that strike. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=136.0s)]
*  We should note amid all of these tragic updates, we do have a small piece of good news for you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=144.0s)]
*  And it's that the Rafa crossing between Egypt and Gaza is open today to get many injured and vulnerable Palestinians out and also get foreign citizens up to 500 of them out of the Gaza Strip that have been waiting for weeks to get to safety. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=149.0s)]
*  Guys. Hey, Trey, with this first batch of people who are trying to leave Gaza go into Israel, as you just said, there are a number of seriously injured people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=163.0s)]
*  And that's why Egypt's got ambulances lined up on their side. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=175.0s)]
*  There won't be any Americans today. At what point might the Americans who are stuck in Gaza be able to leave? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=179.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. And look, it could be a very long time. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=188.0s)]
*  This is the initial batch of people that is going to get out as part of a Qatari and Egyptian led negotiation. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=195.0s)]
*  But there are reportedly thousands of foreign nationals that are inside Gaza. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=202.0s)]
*  We know hundreds of American passport holders there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=207.0s)]
*  And so it could take a very long time because the Israelis are still operating at many different points along the strip. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=210.0s)]
*  And so while this is a piece of good news and it indicates that Hamas is going to allow these people to leave, the Egyptians are going to open that crossing and let people get to safety. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=216.0s)]
*  This is just a few hundred people. We're talking about thousands that need to get out. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=224.0s)]
*  Trey, do you know if they're allowing Americans to get on that list? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=228.0s)]
*  I know you talked to that one woman. She, I think, is an American, has an American passport. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=232.0s)]
*  She's not on the list, but her son, American passport and Jordanian passport. And he is on the list. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=236.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. They both have U.S. passports and he also has a Jordanian passport. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=245.0s)]
*  So they put him on the list, but they didn't put her on the list. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=250.0s)]
*  And she's been talking with the State Department each and every day since this war began. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=253.0s)]
*  And you heard in that voice note that she sent me. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=257.0s)]
*  She's incredibly frustrated with the Biden administration and the State Department. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=259.0s)]
*  And it focuses around one specific thing. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=264.0s)]
*  And it's the fact that the State Department keeps telling her to go to the Rafa crossing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=267.0s)]
*  And when she gets there, she risks her life going in the midst of this active war zone. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=271.0s)]
*  They don't let her cross. And so she has told me now she's not even going to leave until she can really confirm that Americans are indeed getting through and that she can take her 10 year old son with her. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=276.0s)]
*  Cross into Egypt and then ultimately go back to her home in Utah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=286.0s)]
*  That's terrible. So where is she living right now? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=290.0s)]
*  Is she just essentially just camped out a thousand yards from the crossing? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=294.0s)]
*  So right now she's in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=302.0s)]
*  She's staying with friends of friends. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=305.0s)]
*  And she said everyone is staying in one room and they're terrified because these are civilians. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=308.0s)]
*  They are not combatants and they are in the middle of this active fighting. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=313.0s)]
*  She's seen the rockets going out. Everyone in Gaza has. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=317.0s)]
*  She's heard the airstrike shaking the ground there. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=320.0s)]
*  And so it's not just her that's trapped. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=323.0s)]
*  We've been talking with aid workers, American citizens who are stuck in Gaza. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=326.0s)]
*  They tell Fox News they're running low on food. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=330.0s)]
*  They don't have clean water and they feel abandoned. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=332.0s)]
*  Why did she? Was she telling you why she decided to stay? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=335.0s)]
*  She didn't want to send her son across. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=340.0s)]
*  I do know the reason why she was in Gaza. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=342.0s)]
*  Originally, she was visiting her father, who is a Palestinian man who I believe is also an American citizen. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=344.0s)]
*  But there are many Palestinians that go to Gaza to visit their family during times of peace with more than two million people. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=351.0s)]
*  You can imagine there are so many people that have links to the United States, even a journalist that we've known for years. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=358.0s)]
*  He lives now in Chicago, but he was in Gaza visiting his family when the war started and he still stuck there. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=365.0s)]
*  His family is in the United States. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=371.0s)]
*  Real quick. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=373.0s)]
*  Admiral Kirby said yesterday we have no evidence that Hamas is taking any of the humanitarian aid that is coming in. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=374.0s)]
*  Like 60 trucks have come in the last couple of days. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=380.0s)]
*  Is that true? Have you heard Hamas trying to take some of this aid, the food, the water, the fuel? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=383.0s)]
*  I would question that statement. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=391.0s)]
*  I think it's critical that we ask further questions about that statement. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=393.0s)]
*  I'm not saying what Admiral Kirby is saying is not true, but I would ask how they've been able to verify that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=397.0s)]
*  Because they haven't been able to get other information from inside the Strip. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=403.0s)]
*  So how do they know that none of the aid is being diverted to Hamas? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=406.0s)]
*  They've done it in the past. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=410.0s)]
*  We know they're storing fuel and food inside the Strip that was meant for civilians. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=411.0s)]
*  And so they could easily be doing that now. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=416.0s)]
*  There's a lot of questions that have to be asked about the situation inside Gaza. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=418.0s)]
*  And it's from all sides. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=421.0s)]
*  The Israelis releasing the information about the Jabalia strike yesterday. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=422.0s)]
*  And they say they know the number of Hamas militants that were killed in a tunnel beneath that neighborhood. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=426.0s)]
*  But it's unclear how they were able to confirm that information because they would have to dig up the bodies in the tunnel. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=431.0s)]
*  And so there's a lot of information coming out from inside Gaza. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=437.0s)]
*  And we are being incredibly careful with what we're reporting here because there is this fog of war as the conflict develops in day 26. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=440.0s)]
*  You're trying to be so careful. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=447.0s)]
*  Excellent reporting, Trey. Thank you. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=449.0s)]
*  So to that point, thanks, Trey, to that point of fact checking the information we had the former ambassador on who's now the senior advisor to Netanyahu, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=451.0s)]
*  he makes the point of the men that are surrounding the area of the blast site. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=462.0s)]
*  Let's play that first. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=468.0s)]
*  If Hamas is eradicated, as Israel would like to see and many people around the world would, what happens next? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=469.0s)]
*  Who's waiting in the wings? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=479.0s)]
*  So first of all, can I just rephrase your question and say when Hamas is eradicated? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=481.0s)]
*  I like that better. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=486.0s)]
*  Because we are determined. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=487.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=488.0s)]
*  We will do this. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=489.0s)]
*  The bottom line is we refuse. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=490.0s)]
*  We refuse to live next to this enclave of terror. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=492.0s)]
*  On our border, that enclave will be destroyed. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=495.0s)]
*  That's good for Israel. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=498.0s)]
*  That's good for the civilians of Gaza. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=499.0s)]
*  We will end Hamas's regime of terror in the Gaza Strip. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=501.0s)]
*  So that's actually another clip of him saying what he's going to do, what Israel is going to do to destroy Hamas. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=505.0s)]
*  But after that, he makes the point that do you see all these age fighting men that are surrounding the blast site? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=510.0s)]
*  At the refugee camp. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=518.0s)]
*  At the refugee camp. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=519.0s)]
*  Where are the women? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=520.0s)]
*  Where are the children that they were all talking about? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=521.0s)]
*  He was alleging, I think we can infer from, that they may be these age fighting men, a part of Hamas. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=523.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=529.0s)]
*  And Jabalia, just so you know at home, we call it a refugee camp. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=530.0s)]
*  That's what they call it because they are refugees. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=534.0s)]
*  But they don't live in tents. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=536.0s)]
*  And that's what many people picture when they're not living on cots. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=538.0s)]
*  It's an urban area. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=541.0s)]
*  It is an urban area. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=542.0s)]
*  There are buildings there. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=543.0s)]
*  And you can see here, we have the video of that where Israel blasts that area. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=544.0s)]
*  There's a crater. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=549.0s)]
*  There's a huge crater. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=550.0s)]
*  There's a huge crater. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=551.0s)]
*  And you have all of the people down on the ground walking around in the crater. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=552.0s)]
*  And his point to you, Lawrence, when you asked him that question was, take a look at the, they're men. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=557.0s)]
*  They're young men. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=561.0s)]
*  They're the fighters that are there. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=562.0s)]
*  He said that they're trying to get everyone notified, move down to the southern area. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=564.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=569.0s)]
*  Keep in mind, Egypt doesn't want to have a refugee camp. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=570.0s)]
*  This is the video. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=572.0s)]
*  His point is, where are the women and children? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=574.0s)]
*  Al Jazeera did say that one reporter there lost 19 members of their family in this blast. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=576.0s)]
*  I was watching some of that reporting last night. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=581.0s)]
*  And there are, there's definitely innocent people that are caught in this bombing. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=583.0s)]
*  The Israelis have had 11,000 targets inside Gaza, which is 25 miles wide, 5 miles wide and 25 miles long. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=588.0s)]
*  You know, so it's small and it's got 2.5 million people. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=599.0s)]
*  So that's going to happen. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=604.0s)]
*  But the other problem is, is that Hamas hides within the masses and they're not letting even people get to that Rafah Gate. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=605.0s)]
*  But if you just saw the split screen of the live video, look at the split screen. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=611.0s)]
*  I mean, they look like, though, it looks like the place has been hit multiple times since we hopped on the air. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=615.0s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=620.0s)]
*  And so the Israelis yesterday were targeting this refugee camp specifically because we know they've got the bad guys under the hospital. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=621.0s)]
*  They're in Mosques. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=629.0s)]
*  They're in schools. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=630.0s)]
*  They were targeting one specific Hamas leader and they got it. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=631.0s)]
*  They also got some other leaders. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=636.0s)]
*  And so here's that sound bite you were talking about. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=638.0s)]
*  Listen to Mark Rugev, former ambassador, talk a little bit about look at the people standing around. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=642.0s)]
*  Where are the women and children? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=648.0s)]
*  Watch. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=649.0s)]
*  The people around the crater where our strike had happened were mostly young men of military age. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=650.0s)]
*  And they didn't look like a lot of innocent civilians to me. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=656.0s)]
*  But what I can tell you is this. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=659.0s)]
*  If you are part of the Hamas leadership, if you are part of the command structure that was responsible for the rapes, the murders, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=661.0s)]
*  the beheadings, the mass shootings, the massacres that they perpetrated in Israel, we will find you and we will take you out. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=669.0s)]
*  The one thing I would say is don't take the bait. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=679.0s)]
*  I mean, Hamas is very good at propaganda. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=682.0s)]
*  They will send messages. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=686.0s)]
*  They're trying to play on the emotions of not just Americans, but the international community because they know they hide behind civilians. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=687.0s)]
*  That is their entire plan. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=695.0s)]
*  We know this for a fact as we look at the live picture of Gaza, all this smoke that's going on. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=697.0s)]
*  The war is under way. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=702.0s)]
*  That's what's so sad about the whole thing, right? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=703.0s)]
*  I mean, there are so many women and children that are there, people who don't agree with Hamas, but they don't have the right to even speak up or they're afraid they're going to get killed. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=704.0s)]
*  And they can't leave their landlocked. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=712.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=713.0s)]
*  So let's talk about what is another big concern is can these attacks transfer to an attack here at all? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=714.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=719.0s)]
*  Especially when your southern border is open and the northern border has been infiltrated like never before in our history. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=720.0s)]
*  Our FBI director was brought to Capitol Hill yesterday to answer some questions and he says what's happening over there could definitely inspire people who might be Hamas agents over here. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=725.0s)]
*  Listen. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=737.0s)]
*  We assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration, the likes of which we haven't seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate several years ago. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=739.0s)]
*  The ongoing war in the Middle East has raised the threat of an attack against Americans in the United States to a whole nother level. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=751.0s)]
*  We also cannot and do not discount the possibility that Hamas or another foreign terrorist organization may exploit the current conflict to conduct attacks here on our own soil. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=759.0s)]
*  Do you believe is the United States safer from foreign terror threats today? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=772.0s)]
*  Are we safer than when Joe Biden took office from the day he took office? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=777.0s)]
*  What I would say to you is that the terror threats have elevated, but I also think there are a lot of things the country has done throughout law enforcement to be better prepared to deal with them. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=781.0s)]
*  So did you notice what he did? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=798.0s)]
*  Long pause. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=800.0s)]
*  How do I answer this? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=801.0s)]
*  Because the answer is we are not as safe as we were under the last administration. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=802.0s)]
*  And then he said law enforcement. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=807.0s)]
*  We've done a lot to elevate law enforcement. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=809.0s)]
*  So he's praising law enforcement, which was great. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=811.0s)]
*  And he's right. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=813.0s)]
*  The threat level has increased significantly. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=814.0s)]
*  Look at the numbers. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=817.0s)]
*  Particularly when it comes to anti-Semitism. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=818.0s)]
*  We've got some updates for you. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=821.0s)]
*  Remember there was that threat posted online at Cornell where somebody threatened to shoot up quote 104 West, which is a university dining hall that caters predominantly to kosher diets and slit the throat of any Jewish men. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=823.0s)]
*  That this person came across. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=838.0s)]
*  Well, now, according to the cops, they have arrested 21 year old Patrick Die. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=839.0s)]
*  He's a junior at Cornell. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=845.0s)]
*  He's been charged with making threats. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=847.0s)]
*  He faces five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=850.0s)]
*  And his parents say he could not possibly have done it, even though, according to New York rather the NBC News, he confessed. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=854.0s)]
*  He said he was a culprit. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=862.0s)]
*  But nonetheless, the parents say he didn't do it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=864.0s)]
*  He was just very depressed. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=867.0s)]
*  Lawrence has the has the tweet. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=868.0s)]
*  Do you have it in front of you? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=870.0s)]
*  So this is what the kid posted on the chat. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=871.0s)]
*  On the chat. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=874.0s)]
*  Under the name Hamas Warrior, he says the genocide of fascist Zionist regime will be destroyed, raping, kill all Jew women before all they birth before they birth more Jewish Hitler's. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=875.0s)]
*  Jewess are on the face. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=886.0s)]
*  Wipe the Jews off the face of the earth. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=888.0s)]
*  No Jews civilian are innocent of genocide. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=890.0s)]
*  So I mean, people that struggle and there are millions, thousands of people that struggle with depression in this country every single day. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=893.0s)]
*  That's what his dad said about it. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=901.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean you're anti-Semitic. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=902.0s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that you want to slice the throats of Jews. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=903.0s)]
*  I mean, I just I think that demonizes the folks that actually have depression. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=906.0s)]
*  He could be looking at five years in jail. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=911.0s)]
*  And there are also problems at Cornell big time. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=913.0s)]
*  And I don't think the faculty is that upset by it. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=915.0s)]
*  That's really disturbing. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=918.0s)]
*  For example, days before that came out, F Israel was written all over graffiti scribbled on the sidewalks all over that campus. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=919.0s)]
*  So, I mean, obviously it's not one depressed person. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=927.0s)]
*  There's a school with thought there. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=930.0s)]
*  And it's not the only Ivy League institution that's having trouble. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=931.0s)]
*  For example, what happened over at Yale we've been talking about. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=934.0s)]
*  I mean, anyone who's grown up, especially in the church, knows that every child is a child of God's. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=938.0s)]
*  Every person is God's child. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=944.0s)]
*  God created them. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=946.0s)]
*  So to imagine being able to slit someone's throat or want to go to another country and hate them just because of their religion. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=947.0s)]
*  What if this were the Muslim community? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=952.0s)]
*  What if this were the African-American community? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=954.0s)]
*  And we said this about the whole community. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=956.0s)]
*  People would be outraged. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=958.0s)]
*  Why are they not outraged when people are anti-Semitic? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=960.0s)]
*  Well, and Brian, to your point about Yale, it was on October 7th. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=963.0s)]
*  So rather October 13th, about a week after the strike on Israel. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=966.0s)]
*  And the Yale newspaper had a column, an op-ed thing. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=973.0s)]
*  And the headline was, is Yalees for Palestine a hate group? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=978.0s)]
*  And it was by a sophomore you just talked to. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=983.0s)]
*  And then about a week after that, the editors of the Yale News ran a correction and said, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=985.0s)]
*  This column has been edited to remove unsubstantiated claims that Hamas raped women and beheaded men. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=993.0s)]
*  But we know that they did that. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=999.0s)]
*  So why exactly did they have a correction there? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1001.0s)]
*  And then just last night, they put this up. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1004.0s)]
*  They walked it all back. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1007.0s)]
*  They said, the news was wrong to publish the correction. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1008.0s)]
*  The news, therefore, retracts the editors' notes in their entirety and without qualification. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1011.0s)]
*  And goes on to say, apparently, the editor does, that threats of violence level against the news and its editors and their families have intensified this week. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1016.0s)]
*  Apparently, there have been people now reaching out a lot of hate messages to the people who work at the newspaper. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1025.0s)]
*  And there's also calls for people to stop giving to Yale. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1032.0s)]
*  So Yale may cross the board. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1036.0s)]
*  So here's Sahar Tartak. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1038.0s)]
*  She weighed in on what she's been through and the final retraction, which has her triumphed. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1039.0s)]
*  I don't think it's possible for public pressure to change a deeply rooted anti-Jewish current that exists in the university and is therefore translated to our flagship newspaper. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1044.0s)]
*  One that I will note is a pipeline to other major outlets, The New York Times, Washington Post. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1059.0s)]
*  You have the videos of Hamas' brutalizations. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1066.0s)]
*  They made those videos to recruit young men to their movement. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1069.0s)]
*  And so now you have a choice. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1074.0s)]
*  You can side with Hamas by either justifying or denying actions or you can choose not to side with Hamas. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1076.0s)]
*  It's so simple. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1082.0s)]
*  So I asked her the question, since they did the retraction, do you think there has been a change of heart? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1084.0s)]
*  And her response was, they only did this because of public pressure. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1089.0s)]
*  And she noted that we should realize that this is a publication on the college campus. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1093.0s)]
*  But New York Times, Washington Post, they get articles from this publication. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1098.0s)]
*  So she goes, this is not just a university problem. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1103.0s)]
*  This is mainstream right now. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1106.0s)]
*  And we shouldn't think because they did a retraction that their hearts have been changed. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1107.0s)]
*  So I thought that was a powerful saving. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1111.0s)]
*  What about the UC system? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1113.0s)]
*  They got together, their ethnic studies group, and called on the administration of all the University of California to retract the charges of terrorism on Hamas. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1114.0s)]
*  And they said, try to uplift the Palestinian freedom struggle, which got a rebuke by Jay Soros of UTA, who's a member of the U.S. Board of Regents, and just took them on for two pages. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1124.0s)]
*  Said, they are a terror group. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1134.0s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1136.0s)]
*  So that is the entertainment world taking aim at the educational world. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1138.0s)]
*  We've been saying this forever. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1143.0s)]
*  Andy McCarthy wrote a book about in 2011 the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood on college campuses that has taken root and obviously having great success melting minds to this terrorist mindset. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1145.0s)]
*  Before this conflict even happened, hate crimes were on the rise for Jews in this country. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1156.0s)]
*  The FBI director, I'm so sorry, Ainsley, I think you were about to allude to that. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1164.0s)]
*  60 percent? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1167.0s)]
*  He said 60 percent of all religious-based hate crimes in America are against the Jews. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1169.0s)]
*  Yeah, so this was an environment before. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1175.0s)]
*  I failed to believe that it's just a lack of education. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1178.0s)]
*  Sometimes you've got to believe your eyes. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1181.0s)]
*  Sometimes you've got to look in the street and see the Hamas fly. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1183.0s)]
*  Sometimes you've got to listen to the rhetoric of these kids and these professors and take them at their word. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1186.0s)]
*  And Lawrence, just look at the number, though, of the people who are on that side. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1191.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1197.0s)]
*  That is the next generation. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1198.0s)]
*  More people have posted online. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1200.0s)]
*  Granted, there are the younger people that use hashtags generally. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1201.0s)]
*  But stand with Palestine is getting more than stand with Israel. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1205.0s)]
*  A lot more. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1208.0s)]
*  Extrapolate this out. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1210.0s)]
*  Democrats, like the President of the United States, who's for Israel. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1211.0s)]
*  Turns out the next generation of Democratic voters isn't. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1214.0s)]
*  And that's the war that's happening in Congress right now. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1217.0s)]
*  You dropped 11 points already. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKOa8wDKeM&t=1219.0s)]
