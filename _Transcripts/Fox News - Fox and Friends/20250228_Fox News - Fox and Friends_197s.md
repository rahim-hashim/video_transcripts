**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY)
*  815 now here in New York City and we've got some new developments from out west in the deaths of legendary actor Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=0.0s)]
*  Officials are not calling their deaths suspicious. That's different than yesterday as Hackman's daughter speaks out for the first time [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Ty Pyro has the detail. Why are they saying it's suspicious time? I'll get into that right now Lawrence [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=15.56s)]
*  We're hearing now from Hackman's youngest daughter telling the Daily Mail [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=20.68s)]
*  She had not talked to her father and stepmother in a couple months [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=23.68s)]
*  But she said her 95 year old father was quote very good physical condition up until his passing the two-time Oscar winner and his wife [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=26.72s)]
*  Betsy along with one of their dogs found dead at their Santa Fe, New Mexico home on Wednesday after a maintenance worker grew concerned [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=33.56s)]
*  after not seeing the couple for two weeks a police affidavit also revealing the couple's hands and feet showed signs of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=40.76s)]
*  mummification authorities releasing this [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  911 call [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  Breathing I [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=52.92s)]
*  Have no idea. I'm not inside the house. It's closed. It's long [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=54.64s)]
*  I can't go in but I see them lately she's laying down on a floor from the window [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=57.84s)]
*  Now according to that affidavit detectives believe that the circumstances [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=63.2s)]
*  Surrounding the deaths are quote suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=68.04s)]
*  Although they have not said much more than that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=74.52s)]
*  Hackman was found in the mud room of his home while his wife was found in a bathroom with an open prescription [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Bottle and pills scattered on the countertop [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=81.88000000000001s)]
*  Also, one of the couple's dogs was found dead inside a bathroom closet [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  But two other dogs were found alive on the property the affidavit also noting that while the front door of the home was a jar [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  There was no sign of forced entry or theft the affidavit also suggesting the couple may have died due to some kind of gas poisoning [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=96.0s)]
*  But the New Mexico Gas Company did not find any problems [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=103.64000000000001s)]
*  Officials are also saying there were no signs of visible trauma to the bodies the case remains open pending [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=107.55999999999999s)]
*  Autopsy and toxicology results back over to you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=113.56s)]
*  Yeah, you understand 95 but a 65 year old to die at the same time [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  And the dog originally we heard it was in a crate now you're saying found dead in a closet dogs are in crate [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=121.64s)]
*  And you know what mummified I don't know why they're using that word. That means it's usually the body's preserved. Well [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=127.36s)]
*  Decomposed decomposed. Yeah, but to happen so quickly though [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=132.64s)]
*  That is different. Well, see that's why yesterday we thought it could be some sort of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=137.28s)]
*  But as Todd mentioned the gas company has been cooperating they they checked the lines in the area. There were no malfunctions [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=143.72s)]
*  It will be ongoing. They're supposed to have the toxicology report back shortly and the autopsies have been what about the done [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  There's gonna be a press conference about the other two dogs. That's right [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=156.96s)]
*  They were but they were outside they could keep in mind if the dogs inside there's nothing to eat for a couple of weeks [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=160.28s)]
*  It could have been that the dog who was found dead maybe ate some of the pills [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  We just don't know but also one report says the door front door was a jar [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=170.0s)]
*  But when you listen to the 911 call of the maintenance guy who was calling he was looking through the window [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=174.16s)]
*  He said I see a body on the ground, but the door is locked. So was that maybe the back door? Yeah [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=178.94s)]
*  Yeah [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=186.32s)]
*  You [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I9McgG5QY&t=195.96s)]
