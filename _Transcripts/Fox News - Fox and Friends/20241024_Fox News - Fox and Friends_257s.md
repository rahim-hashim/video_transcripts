# Kamala Harris struggles with Anderson Cooper's border wall questions
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc)
*  So here is the easy, simple question and our answer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=0.0s)]
*  Get your stopwatch out. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  It's gonna be exciting. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=6.82s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=7.92s)]
*  2022, 2023, there were record border crossings. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=9.8s)]
*  Your administration took a number, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=13.56s)]
*  hundreds of executive actions. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=16.48s)]
*  It didn't stem the flow. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Numbers kept going up. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=19.56s)]
*  Finally, in 2024, just in June, three weeks [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=21.2s)]
*  before the first presidential debate with Joe Biden, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=26.04s)]
*  you instituted executive actions that had a dramatic impact, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=29.56s)]
*  really shut down people crossing over. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  Why didn't your administration do that in 2022, 2023? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=34.72s)]
*  First of all, you're exactly right, Anderson. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=38.68s)]
*  And as of today, we have cut the flow of immigration [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  by over half. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=44.08s)]
*  In fact, the numbers I saw most recently, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=44.92s)]
*  illegal immigration is low. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=47.0s)]
*  But if it was that easy with that executive action, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  why not do it in 2022, 2023? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  Because we were working with Congress [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=52.36s)]
*  and hoping that actually we could have a long-term fix [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=54.32s)]
*  to the problem instead of a short-term fix. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  You couldn't have done one and both at the same time? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=58.48s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  We have to understand that ultimately this problem [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=61.68s)]
*  is going to be fixed through congressional action. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=65.88s)]
*  Under Donald Trump, you criticized the wall more than 50 times. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=68.12s)]
*  You called it stupid, useless, and a medieval vanity project. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=71.39999999999999s)]
*  Is a border wall stupid? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=76.0s)]
*  Well, let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=77.92s)]
*  So remember Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=81.6s)]
*  Come on, they didn't. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=85.8s)]
*  How much of that wall did he build? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=87.92s)]
*  I think the last number I saw was about 2%. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=89.72s)]
*  To fix the problem, you're doing this compromise bill. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=92.08s)]
*  It does call for $650 million that was earmarked under Trump [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  to actually still go to build the wall. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=98.76s)]
*  I'm not afraid of good ideas where they occur, Anderson. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=100.36s)]
*  You don't think it's stupid anymore? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=102.76s)]
*  I think what he did and how he did it did not make much sense [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=104.8s)]
*  because he actually didn't do much of anything. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  I just talked about that wall, right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=111.76s)]
*  We just talked about it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=113.64s)]
*  He didn't actually do much of anything. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=114.6s)]
*  But you do want to build some wall. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=116.88s)]
*  I want to strengthen our border. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  This is exactly why you have open primaries [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=122.36s)]
*  for candidates to debate and go against each other [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=125.96s)]
*  and have their ideas challenged. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=131.12s)]
*  Because by the time it's time for them to get [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=133.84s)]
*  to the big boy or big girl ticket, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=136.16s)]
*  they have their message honed in. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=139.24s)]
*  Yeah, she would have been their pick. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=141.68s)]
*  She would not have been their pick. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=143.28s)]
*  And this is why Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  don't forget Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=147.24s)]
*  wanted an open primary process. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=149.52s)]
*  But Joe Biden was so bitter in the way [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=151.8s)]
*  that they got rid of him that he slammed in doors [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  right after that tweet that he sent. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=156.8s)]
*  And this is what you get, an untested, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=158.72s)]
*  an unchallenged candidate that's not prepared for prime time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=161.28s)]
*  And she gets to keep the money. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=164.56s)]
*  She got to keep the money from the Joe Biden. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=165.76s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  It was on a ticket. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=168.76s)]
*  Yeah, they could have mailed it back and then reissued it, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=169.6s)]
*  but we never had that chance. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=171.68s)]
*  So here's the problem. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  She called it multiple times a medieval vanity project. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=174.64s)]
*  50 times. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=178.16s)]
*  And now the other thing, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=179.0s)]
*  and I have no criticism of Anderson Cooper, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=180.92s)]
*  not that he cares, but in the middle of the desert, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=183.32s)]
*  right now, are pieces of that wall. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=186.32s)]
*  Right now, you could say you're selling it off [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  on pennies of the dollar, but there's a lot left. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=190.92s)]
*  It does work. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=193.2s)]
*  The Border Patrol has said repeatedly it does help. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=194.2s)]
*  It's not a cure-all, but it does help. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=196.72s)]
*  Why not show you sincerely want to change things [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=198.72s)]
*  by taking the money that's already there, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  by a project that taxpayers already paid for, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  and start doing it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=206.2s)]
*  That would show a revelation and get people who are nervous [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=207.44s)]
*  about what you're really gonna do at the border, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=210.84s)]
*  that you're gonna do something at the border. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=213.2s)]
*  Instead, you got somebody talking in circles, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=214.84s)]
*  had no idea how to handle a follow-up question, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  and has no inclination to fix the border. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=220.28s)]
*  Well, and she did sit down with Telemundo. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=223.88s)]
*  She sat down with NBC earlier in the week yesterday. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=226.64s)]
*  Obviously, their internal polling number shows [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=230.72s)]
*  that people have more questions. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=233.68s)]
*  Unfortunately, she's not providing any more answers. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=235.6s)]
*  It's just more of that broad, vague stuff [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=238.68s)]
*  that drives people crazy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=242.88s)]
*  You want solutions? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=244.0s)]
*  You didn't get them last night. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=245.44s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=246.88s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTiocweypc&t=247.8s)]
