# Trump fires back at Biden over major drilling ban: 'What's he doing?!'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc)
*  President-elect Trump expressing frustration. Frustration with recent moves by President Biden in his final days in office, including Biden's ban on new oil offshore drilling in most federal waters. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=0.0s)]
*  And Peter Ducey is live in Washington with the latest for us. Good morning, Peter. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=13.32s)]
*  Good morning. And it seems like this is really frustrating to the president-elect because there's nothing he can do about it until he gets into the Oval Office just afternoon 13 days from today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=17.12s)]
*  But what we're seeing is President Biden, the current president, throwing a bunch of legacy items at the wall to see what sticks. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=28.32s)]
*  This time he's trying to make oil drilling harder in ways that could be kind of complicated to unban. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=34.88s)]
*  So let's be clear here that the area President Biden is protecting has a relatively minimal fossil fuel potential in the areas and do not justify the environmental, public health and economic risks that would come from new leasing drilling. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=43.96s)]
*  We've got a map of the areas that Biden is banning drilling, but these new bans may be super short-lived. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=58.8s)]
*  In two weeks, President Trump will have two options. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=65.52s)]
*  The first is to get Congress to act and change the law. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=68.88s)]
*  And then the second is to issue his own executive order and then just wait for this all to play out in court some way. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=72.08s)]
*  He says he's going to make it happen. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=79.36s)]
*  It's ridiculous. I'll unban it immediately. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=82.88s)]
*  I will unban it. I have the right to unban it immediately. What's he doing? Why is he doing it? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=85.68s)]
*  We have oil and gas at a level that nobody else has, and we're going to take advantage of it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=90.64s)]
*  And when I see somebody saying he's going to ban 625 million acres, he doesn't know what that is. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=95.68s)]
*  He doesn't even know what 625 million acres would look like. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=101.04s)]
*  Something else the Biden White House is doing on the way out is emptying out Gitmo. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=105.64000000000001s)]
*  11 Yemeni prisoners are on their way to Oman to live freely. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=110.68s)]
*  A lawyer for two of the detainees says they want to live their lives. They want to get married. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=116.04s)]
*  They want to have kids. They want to get a job and have normal lives. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=121.4s)]
*  And once this exchange is done, this release is done, there will be just 15 prisoners left in Guantanamo Bay. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  That is the fewest since they started using that as a military prison for terror suspects after 9-11. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=133.08s)]
*  I wonder how they're going to have their soccer games. They're going to be unbalanced now. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=140.28s)]
*  It would be seven on eight. On a really fancy field, if you remember. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=143.56s)]
*  I wonder if the young people who died in 9-11 might have one of those things too. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=146.68s)]
*  Might have wanted to get married and have a family and play soccer. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=150.52s)]
*  Peter, I know that this flurry of repatriating these people back to Oman is in anticipation of, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=153.0s)]
*  it sounds like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is about to enter a guilty plea. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=161.56s)]
*  And then he would be transported somewhere. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  But there's a law that says that none of these guys can go onto U.S. soil. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  So do we have any idea where they might put that guy and then the other 14? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=172.84s)]
*  Because obviously they want to close the place. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  Not yet. And we don't really have a good idea of how they would keep track of these terrorists [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=179.88s)]
*  once they are released. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=186.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=187.56s)]
*  Yeah. Good point. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=188.28s)]
*  And something that we have seen that has been a huge problem, of course, is [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  you can tell somebody that they're not supposed to enter the United States, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=194.44s)]
*  but people do it by the thousands. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  We've seen the numbers. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=201.96s)]
*  Especially in this administration. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=204.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=204.68s)]
*  You know, I just wonder, like, after all these years, why do these people still have breath? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=205.16000000000003s)]
*  Why they're even a conversation? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=211.0s)]
*  They should have had a legal process where these people could be tried, military tribunal, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=213.24s)]
*  and executed for what they contributed to with 9-11. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=220.12s)]
*  And the fact that they were bodyguards for Osama bin Laden. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=225.24s)]
*  And I think it just goes to the fact, it's what I alluded to yesterday, of Joe Biden. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=228.44s)]
*  He's rejecting what the voters decided, which they didn't want any more of his type of administration. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=233.0s)]
*  There's divided government right now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=237.96s)]
*  We have a new Congress in that's controlled by Republicans [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=239.4s)]
*  when it comes to the Senate as well as the House. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=242.6s)]
*  Instead of just leaving, just leaving, respecting what the voters said, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=245.08s)]
*  he wants to make it difficult for the next president when he comes in. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, one of the things about the people, and keep in mind, once upon a time at Gitmo, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  there were 780 detainees. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=258.04s)]
*  And now, as Peter just said, they're down to the last 15. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=260.52000000000004s)]
*  Most of them have never been charged with anything. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=264.68s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  And most of them have never, there is no connection to 9-11. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  So the problem is, as they try to repatriate, according to the administration, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=272.04s)]
*  the problem is there are very few countries that want to take these guys and house them forever. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=276.36s)]
*  Because keep in mind, most of them have spent their entire adult lives at Gitmo. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  And most of them, according to their lawyers, are suffering from significant mental health issues. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=289.16s)]
*  Who's going to take those guys? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=294.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, well, they are linked to terror. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=295.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=297.16s)]
*  9-11 was fighting Afghanistan, as well as Iraq and the region. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=297.96s)]
*  And now in Yemen, we know it's a hotbed for terrorism. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=302.12s)]
*  The Houthi rebels have established themselves. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=304.76s)]
*  So they're going to Oman. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=306.67999999999995s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  Remember when we took those guys, we took the Afghanis, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=309.71999999999997s)]
*  and we put them in a neighboring country? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  Barack Obama did. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  They end up going back to the battlefield. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, they went back to the battlefield. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  But now they're in power in Kabul, running Afghanistan. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  So they really learned their lesson. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=325.08s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=326.76s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-gcpJ6fFc&t=327.64s)]
