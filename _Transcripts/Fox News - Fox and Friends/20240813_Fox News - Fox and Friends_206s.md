# FBI investigating suspected Iran cyberattack attempts on Trump, Harris campaigns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q)
*  Another alert, the FBI investigating an earlier hack of the Trump campaign and an attempted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=0.0s)]
*  hack of the Biden-Harris campaign, as Intel experts are warning to brace for more disruptions [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=5.24s)]
*  this election season. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=11.1s)]
*  So here with more on what this all means for our election and your vote is cyber guy Kurt [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=12.84s)]
*  Knutson. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=17.92s)]
*  Good morning, Kurt. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=18.92s)]
*  Hey, Ainsley. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=19.92s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=20.92s)]
*  The Trump campaign alleging this is the Iranian actors that are going after his campaign at [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=21.92s)]
*  this point. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=26.84s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=27.92s)]
*  He might be right. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=28.92s)]
*  No matter what, if you're on the left, if you're on the right, you can bet that these [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=29.92s)]
*  kinds of attacks are going to be coming at American politics from now until the November [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=34.56s)]
*  election. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=39.52s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=40.52s)]
*  Are they hacking into emails? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=41.52s)]
*  Are they trying to interfere with the election results? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=42.52s)]
*  I think any way they can get in, and in this particular case, they apparently got a hold [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=46.08s)]
*  of an email list and including documents, one that included the vetting of Vice President [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=49.92s)]
*  And at that point, it was marked personal and confidential, clearly should not have [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=57.72s)]
*  been in the hands of anybody else. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=62.44s)]
*  Else it was then shopped around some websites, including Politico got a hold of it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=64.56s)]
*  This is the kind of information no campaign wants out there. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  It makes it unfair out in the political landscape. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=72.72s)]
*  And at the bottom line here is just like you and I at home, just like corporate America, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=76.4s)]
*  just like government agencies, when you're a campaign, you got to lock your tech down. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=81.56s)]
*  You got to use really strong passwords. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=86.12s)]
*  You got to really train people. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=88.36s)]
*  Don't share stuff. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=90.4s)]
*  Don't click links because that's how they're getting in. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=91.56s)]
*  And obviously use some really good antivirus protection to just lock them out. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=98.52s)]
*  Now, what did you make of this Elon Musk and Donald Trump interview last night that was [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=99.52s)]
*  interrupted by this DDOS attack? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=103.0s)]
*  You know, what this is, is so Twitter, formerly X, formerly known as Twitter, better known [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=107.0s)]
*  as Twitter has an area called spaces and that allows connections to having these kind [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=112.48s)]
*  of live events. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=117.04s)]
*  And it was delayed 40 minutes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=118.04s)]
*  And what Elon Musk is saying is that it had a DDOS disruption. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  DDOS stands for its geek speak for distributed denial of service. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  It simply means that a lot of people or somebody is flooding the same location online with [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=129.44s)]
*  an overwhelming number of requests or connections. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=135.52s)]
*  And that causes it like the plumbing to back up. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=139.36s)]
*  So people cannot get in. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=141.88s)]
*  And that's what they experience. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=143.2s)]
*  So again, tampering with digital media is one more period. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=144.76s)]
*  Who's behind it? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=148.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=149.64s)]
*  But what we do know is that they should, they really should. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=150.64s)]
*  There should be an investigation into that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=153.96s)]
*  We're talking about our free speech being interrupted. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=156.04s)]
*  And that is not what is good for this country at this point. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=158.92s)]
*  Everyone should have the right to speak without interruption. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=163.04s)]
*  And there should not be cyber actors that are going online that are interrupting that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=166.56s)]
*  speech, period. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=171.4s)]
*  Well, I'm glad they figured it out. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=172.4s)]
*  Figured out pretty quickly. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  If that happened to me, probably to you, you'd figure it out quickly. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  But I would just give up. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=178.44000000000003s)]
*  But thankfully that interview went on about 30, 45 minutes later. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=179.72000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much, Kurt, for coming on. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  And good to see you, Ainsley. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=186.48000000000002s)]

*  browsers you should look at. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bBzhSp9_Q&t=191.48000000000002s)]
