# HIGHLIGHTS: The must-see Kamala Harris-Bret Baier interview
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0)
*  Well, it was must-see TV last night. Brett Baer pressed Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=0.0s)]
*  on everything from the border to the economy to Joe's mental fitness during her first formal [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=6.84s)]
*  sit-down interview with Fox News as vice president. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=14.08s)]
*  And with less than three weeks to the election day, the Democratic nominee trying to make [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  the case that she offers a new way forward despite being in power the last three and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=22.0s)]
*  a half years. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=27.28s)]
*  If you're turning the page, you've been in office for three and a half years. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=29.2s)]
*  And Donald Trump has been running for office since he's been holding the office. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  Come on. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=39.12s)]
*  Come on. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=40.12s)]
*  So, it was a tense interview at times as Harris tried to dodge some questions and point the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=41.12s)]
*  blame toward Donald Trump. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=45.84s)]
*  Toward the end of the interview, though, Brett says it had to quickly be wrapped up after [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=48.08s)]
*  her team signaled to him to stop. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=52.64s)]
*  There are critics who look at what the administration did and say and think differently. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=56.48s)]
*  Madam Vice President, they're wrapping me very hard here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  I hope you got to say what you wanted to say about Donald Trump. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=65.0s)]
*  There are a lot of things that... [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=68.52s)]
*  There's more to say. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=69.52s)]
*  I have much more to say. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=70.52s)]
*  Madam Vice President, they're giving me a hard wrap here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=71.52s)]
*  Well, I thank you for the time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=73.84s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  Prior to that moment, Harris faced several tough, direct questions like how her presidency [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=76.67999999999999s)]
*  would differ from the current Biden-Harris administration. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  So, you're not Joe Biden, you're not Donald Trump, but nothing comes to mind that you [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=86.52s)]
*  would do differently? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  Let me be very clear. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=93.55999999999999s)]
*  My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=94.96s)]
*  And like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=99.56s)]
*  my professional experiences and fresh and new ideas. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=106.36s)]
*  I represent a new generation of leadership. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=109.32s)]
*  I, for example, am someone who has not spent the majority of my career in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=111.92s)]
*  Your campaign slogan is a new way forward, and it's time to turn the page. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  You've been vice president for three and a half years. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=122.72s)]
*  So, what are you turning the page from? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=125.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, turning the page from the last decade in which we have been burdened [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=127.76s)]
*  with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that has been designed and implemented [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=135.12s)]
*  to divide our country and have Americans literally point fingers at each other. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=140.96s)]
*  That is turning the page. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=146.24s)]
*  Madam Vice President, more than 70 percent of people tell pollsters. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=147.24s)]
*  That is about turning the page on rhetoric that people are frankly exhausted of breath. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  You've been in office for three and a half years. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  And Donald Trump has been running for office since— [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=157.44s)]
*  But you've been the person holding the office. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  Come on. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=162.56s)]
*  Madam Vice President. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=163.56s)]
*  You and I both know what I'm talking about. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=164.56s)]
*  You and I both know what I'm talking about. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=165.56s)]
*  I actually don't. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=166.56s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=167.56s)]
*  is that over the last decade, people have become— [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=169.32s)]
*  But you're the lever of power. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=172.48s)]
*  But, listen, over the last decade, it is clear to me, and certainly the Republicans who are [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=174.52s)]
*  on stage with me, the former chief of staff to the president, Donald Trump, former defense [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=180.6s)]
*  secretaries, national security adviser and his vice president, one that he is unfit to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=188.04s)]
*  serve, that he is unstable, that he is dangerous. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=193.08s)]
*  So when we had Bret Baier on yesterday to preview the big conversation with Kamala Harris, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  one of the things I noted is that Bret Baier is really good when it comes down to the research. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=205.56s)]
*  And we saw that yesterday because it was question after question based on her record and prior [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=210.84s)]
*  statements. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=216.52s)]
*  And I've got to be honest. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  She didn't meet the moment in the sense of having a response to those questions. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=220.54000000000002s)]
*  But I think it was a better format for Kamala Harris versus some of the softball interviews [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=226.56s)]
*  that she's gotten. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=231.04s)]
*  At least she rose to the cajun in the sense of wanting to fight back. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=232.04s)]
*  And so if you're on the left, maybe you applaud her. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=236.16s)]
*  But if you're someone that's been waiting for the big interview, then you thank Bret [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=239.0s)]
*  Baier for asking those tough questions. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  I was glad he pressed her on. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  You've been the one that's been in office for three and a half years. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=245.12s)]
*  And then it was almost that moment where she said, but I haven't been to Europe either, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=247.78s)]
*  when she said, but Donald Trump was running. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=251.72s)]
*  He said, but you're the one in office. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=254.2s)]
*  You're the one that we're turning to for change. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=256.28s)]
*  You want to turn the page. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=258.56s)]
*  But this is what you've stood for. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=259.8s)]
*  He said in 2019, when you ran for president, you wanted to allow immigrants to apply for [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=260.98s)]
*  driver's licenses, free tuition, free health care. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=264.56s)]
*  Do you still support that? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  Kamala said that was five years ago. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  I will follow the laws. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=269.84s)]
*  And then Bret said, but you chose Tim Walz as your running mate. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  And he signed all of this into state law. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=273.76s)]
*  So do you support this? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=276.2s)]
*  She hesitated. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=277.56s)]
*  And she said, we are clear. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  We will support federal law. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=279.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=281.88s)]
*  To me, that's right. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=283.04s)]
*  Yesterday, when Brett was on with us, as you alluded to, Lawrence, we talked a little [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  bit about how she is a known filibuster. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=290.2s)]
*  Yeah, I saw it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=292.48s)]
*  And as soon as he asked the first question and she went into an answer that we've heard [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  a million times, it was like she was reading a teleprompter. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=299.24s)]
*  But 20 seconds in, he tried to refocus her on the actual question. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=302.7s)]
*  And it was back and forth the whole time. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  I'll tell you this. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=309.32s)]
*  If you and your family set this up as a drinking game before it started and you said, OK, every [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=310.64s)]
*  time she says Donald Trump, I'm going to take a shot, you would have been so stung. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  Smashed. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=323.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=324.8s)]
*  Smashed. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=325.8s)]
*  That's a good word. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=326.8s)]
*  I would say 10 minutes in because she, every time the going got tough, she went to Donald [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=329.4s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=335.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=336.28s)]
*  I think the campaign said we want to be able to say we've done a tough interview. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=337.67999999999995s)]
*  OK, they checked that box. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  They also say, you know, Tim Walz has done a couple of interviews on Fox News Sunday [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=344.4s)]
*  back to back. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=348.76s)]
*  The campaign, Brian Fallon put out a statement and he said that they reached an audience [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=350.44s)]
*  last night that do not hear a lot directly from her. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=355.4s)]
*  And she showed her toughness. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  So I think they think it was a win. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  But the question that really I think is going to be played everywhere was when Brett Bear [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=364.24s)]
*  asked a direct question, when did you know about the diminished faculties of the current [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=371.2s)]
*  president of the United States? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=377.52s)]
*  And she turned to Donald Trump. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=378.84000000000003s)]
*  And she went to Donald Trump. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=380.32s)]
*  And there was a huge pause there as if she was not expecting that question. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=381.72s)]
*  But the answer was not sufficient enough, especially when what we witnessed Ainsley [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=387.08s)]
*  on the debate stage. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=391.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=392.44s)]
*  And I was watching Brett last night on Sean's show. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=393.48s)]
*  And Sean was saying, you know, you were supposed to do this interview at five. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=396.44s)]
*  He said she didn't walk out until 517. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  She knew he had a live show at six o'clock. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=401.2s)]
*  She knew that he had to turn this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=403.68s)]
*  We had to get it into the tape room so that we could push play on that at six o'clock. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=405.72s)]
*  She knew how stressful that would be for the staff, the team. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=411.04s)]
*  And she knew she could eat into some of her time that she had promised Brett Bear. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=414.5s)]
*  Brett said we were supposed to have 25 minutes and she only gave us 20 minutes. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=418.32s)]
*  And he said, I don't like interrupting, but I had to interrupt a lot because she was filibustering. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=422.12s)]
*  She just kept talking and talking about things I wasn't necessarily asking her about. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=427.12s)]
*  He said, so I had to interrupt. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=430.96s)]
*  But he said, if I hadn't interrupted, we would have probably gotten four questions in five [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=432.66s)]
*  minutes per question. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=436.48s)]
*  He said, so I had 75 questions prepared. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=437.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=440.56s)]
*  He was very well prepared and he asked a lot of questions throughout the 26 minutes. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=441.56s)]
*  One of the ways that Donald Trump has really made some hay in the last couple of weeks [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=448.4s)]
*  is with an ad talking about how she supports surgery for prisoners, gender changing surgery. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=452.76s)]
*  And he asked her about that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=461.56s)]
*  And once again, she started an answer and then she mentioned Donald Trump. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=464.12s)]
*  Watch. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  So are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  illegal aliens to transition to another gender? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=476.12s)]
*  I will follow the law. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=479.48s)]
*  And it's a law that Donald Trump actually followed. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=481.88s)]
*  You're probably familiar with now it's a public report that under Donald Trump's administration, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=485.08s)]
*  these surgeries were available to on a medical necessity basis to people in the federal prison [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=491.44s)]
*  system. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=499.48s)]
*  And I think, frankly, that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=500.52s)]
*  you know, stones when you're living in a glass house. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  The Trump aides say that he never advocated for that prison policy and no gender transition [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  surgery happened during his presidency. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=511.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, you know what, you've got to take responsibility for what happened in your administration. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=514.0s)]
*  Yeah, no surgeries happened in his presidency. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=515.52s)]
*  It's in black and white. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=517.64s)]
*  So would you still advocate for using taxpayer dollars for gender reassignment surgeries? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=518.64s)]
*  I will follow the law. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=522.32s)]
*  Obviously, she didn't answer, Ainsley, the yes or no question, which is do you support [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=523.8000000000001s)]
*  taxpayer funds going to gender reassignment? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=529.2s)]
*  But that, I mean, she always traps herself. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=531.86s)]
*  And that last line, you got to take responsibility for what happens in your administration. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=534.64s)]
*  So the border, the 8. some million folks that have come across the border, the record inflation [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=540.24s)]
*  in this country, grocery prices going up, an economy that is not bouncing back. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=545.48s)]
*  Maybe if you like the stock market, then you're happy with it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=551.0s)]
*  But if you're going to the grocery stores, is she responsible since this is her administration? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=553.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, she keeps saying I'll follow the law, follow the law and the gender transitioning [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=558.36s)]
*  in prison. I'll follow the law when it comes to the border. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=564.24s)]
*  Well, you have access to the law. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=567.4000000000001s)]
*  If you're the vice president, if you're running for president and you become president, you [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=569.44s)]
*  can change the law. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=573.24s)]
*  There are executive orders and they did away with most of Donald Trump's executive orders [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=574.84s)]
*  when it came to immigration. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=578.84s)]
*  And Brett knows the facts. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=580.6s)]
*  And Brett really pressed her on this and said, what about immigration? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=581.88s)]
*  How many have crossed the border under your administration? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=585.2s)]
*  She couldn't answer that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=587.44s)]
*  She pivoted and changed the subject. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=588.44s)]
*  But she mentioned the amnesty bill again. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=590.5200000000001s)]
*  Brett said that would have given 11 million illegals amnesty, a pathway to citizenship, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=593.12s)]
*  because when she's asked about immigration, oh, on day one, right after hours within us taking the oath, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=598.1600000000001s)]
*  we tried to pass the U.S. Citizenship Act. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  And then that's when Brett said that would have allowed 11 million people to get citizenship. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=606.0s)]
*  That's an amnesty bill. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=609.9200000000001s)]
*  And then she started talking about the bipartisan border bill that Donald Trump landed on Donald Trump, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=611.36s)]
*  that it never passed. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=616.64s)]
*  And Brett said, but Democrats voted against it and Democrats had problems with it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=617.9200000000001s)]
*  And that would have allowed 1.8 million illegals to be allowed in our country every year. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=621.68s)]
*  That is not closing the border. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=626.4s)]
*  So the question is, after the 26-minute interview, how many people who are watching Fox or saw the clips [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=628.16s)]
*  would actually say, you know, I was undecided. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to change my mind. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=638.16s)]
*  We've talked a little bit about how there are so few. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=639.68s)]
*  There's just a narrow little sliver of the electorate that is undecided. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=642.4s)]
*  But what's interesting, Fox News came out with a brand new poll yesterday. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=646.16s)]
*  And it had some good news for Donald Trump. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=649.76s)]
*  He is now leading her by two. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=652.0s)]
*  She was ahead by two in the last poll. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=654.56s)]
*  But what's interesting, in the Fox poll, it says that 10 percent of his supporters [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=656.64s)]
*  and 10 percent about 10 percent of his supporters and about 10 percent of her supporters [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=661.68s)]
*  might change their mind. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=668.0799999999999s)]
*  So ultimately, they took a high-risk gamble to come on Fox and get a great grilling by the great Brett Baer. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=669.52s)]
*  Did she change any minds? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=678.16s)]
*  It's interesting because earlier in the day, she appeared on stage there in Pennsylvania [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=680.32s)]
*  with a bunch of Republicans who said, OK, we're supporting her. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=685.28s)]
*  One other fact from the Fox News poll is 20 percent of non-MAGA Republicans [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=689.2s)]
*  apparently are going to vote for her. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=694.72s)]
*  The balance of them are going to vote for him. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0&t=696.64s)]
