# Elon Musk urged to audit US gold reserves
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA)
*  All right. So this morning to talk about going for the gold, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk and Doge set in their sights on the country's largest gold reserve, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=2.48s)]
*  Fort Knox in Kentucky, as its own Senator reveals that $425 billion [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=6.4s)]
*  of a gold supply doesn't even get a yearly review. Kentucky Senator [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=12.6s)]
*  Rand Paul joins us now. So Senator, I didn't know it was that much money there. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=16.76s)]
*  And I was even more surprised that there's been no review. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=21.64s)]
*  Well, you know, I've been trying to go down and see the gold and make [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=27.32s)]
*  sure it's all there for about 10 years. During the first Trump administration, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=29.92s)]
*  I got permission. You have to get permission all the way up to the Secretary [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  of Treasury. And then the Secretary of Treasury said, well, I want to go down [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  there too. And then he said, I want to go down there when the eclipse is coming [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  through Kentucky too, so I can see the eclipse and the gold at the same time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=44.92s)]
*  But they came when I wasn't there. So I tried for 10 years. I set up the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=49.0s)]
*  appointment and then because they wanted to see the eclipse, they changed the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  appointment. I didn't get to go down. But the Secretary of Treasury and the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=55.88s)]
*  Senior Senator from Kentucky did go down and attest that they believe they [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=58.96s)]
*  saw the gold down there. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=63.4s)]
*  So what do you think the problem is? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=64.56s)]
*  You know, I think some of them may not think it needs to be outed all the time, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=68.28s)]
*  but I think the more sunlight, the better, more transparency, the better. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  And also it brings attention to the fact that gold still has value and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=75.32s)]
*  implicitly, not explicitly, but implicitly, gold still gives value to the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=79.64s)]
*  dollar. That's why we don't get rid of it. You know, we've got it. The IMF has [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=84.4s)]
*  it. The World Bank has it. Most of the central banks around the world have [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=88.56s)]
*  gold, and it's an implicit trust that the dollar still has some backing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=92.2s)]
*  So, Senator, I want to switch gears with you. I want to talk about the, since [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  we're talking about money, the GOP budget resolution that is apparently in [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=100.68s)]
*  jeopardy over concern from the moderates as well as Democrats about the budget. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=105.2s)]
*  Talk about it. I mean, you are your father's son, and so I know you've had [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  these objections to it. What are they now? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=117.4s)]
*  Well, this year the deficit's going to be $2.2 trillion. In March, both parties [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  will come back and probably spend $300 billion more in California for wildfires [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=128.68s)]
*  and it will be borrowed, not paid for. We just spent another $100 billion in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=133.6s)]
*  North Carolina. It never seems to end and we don't borrow it. So what I would [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=137.88s)]
*  say is for border, if you want money for the border, take it from somewhere else [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  in the budget, but let's don't have a new spending bill. So this budget is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=146.16s)]
*  setting up a new spending bill and ultimately this year there'll be a $2.2 [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=150.2s)]
*  trillion and people will be scratching their head saying, what about all the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=154.4s)]
*  cuts? What about all the things? The Doge committee, Elon Musk has found billions [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=157.68s)]
*  of dollars. The way you save money and it has to be done is they send it back [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=163.4s)]
*  to Congress in something called a rescission package and then we vote on it [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=167.96s)]
*  with a simple majority. So Republicans alone can cut the spending that Doge is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=171.8s)]
*  finding, but they're doing a great job and they're going through it with [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  rapidity, but it's got to come back to Congress. If I started seeing that, I [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=180.36s)]
*  might be more inclined to go along with them. I'm almost out of time, but I got to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  quickly ask you, why aren't you in the room? Because as I've said, you haven't [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=187.4s)]
*  changed your position. You're still reasonable though. You understand you're [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  not going to get everything. I believe your support of a bill would get some of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=195.0s)]
*  the folks in the House. You'll get Chippewa. You'll get Thomas Mass's support [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=198.56s)]
*  if you were involved in the negotiation. So I think Thune has been doing a fairly [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  good job compared to McConnell, but why haven't you been involved with the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=206.68s)]
*  negotiation? I've told the negotiators from the very beginning, if they want my [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=210.68s)]
*  vote, they have to talk to me about the numbers. They have to be believable [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  numbers and we have to adhere to them. If the numbers in the budget resolution [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=219.84s)]
*  will be adhered to by the Appropriations Committee, I could be inclined to support [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=223.88s)]
*  the budget, but so far I've seen no indication. For example, there's a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=228.12s)]
*  trillion dollars difference between the budget document and what we're going to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=232.16s)]
*  spend this year. So it becomes a fiction and if it's not honest accounting and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=235.84s)]
*  they're not honestly going to do it, I don't want to vote for a rubber stamp [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=239.72s)]
*  that actually leads to increased spending. I think that's fair. Hopefully [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  they bring you in because I think some good can be done. Senator, thanks so much [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=247.0s)]
*  for giving us some time this morning. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  you [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmAi0c69biA&t=258.12s)]
