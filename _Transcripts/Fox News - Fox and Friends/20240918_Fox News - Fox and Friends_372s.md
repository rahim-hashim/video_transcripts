# Hezbollah vows retaliation for exploding pagers attack
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0)
*  Fox News Lord Hezbollah. Hezbollah is vowing to punish Israel after accusing them of wounding [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=0.0s)]
*  thousands across Lebanon by detonating explosives hidden inside pagers. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  The devices were reportedly tampered with by Israeli intelligence operatives before [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=12.08s)]
*  they ended up in the pockets of the Iranian-backed terrorists. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=17.0s)]
*  Mike Tobin joins us live from Tel Aviv. Mike, we've never seen this kind of a brilliant [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=20.52s)]
*  strategic move like this in history. What are the people of Israel saying about it? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=27.12s)]
*  Well, the Israelis are rather proud of their Mossad. Of course, the Mossad hasn't [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=31.8s)]
*  confirmed that they were part of this attack. People on the other side of the border are rather [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=37.68s)]
*  outraged. The Lebanese Health Ministry now says that the death toll from this pager attack has [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  risen to 12, and they say it includes two children. Around 3,000 people were injured [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=45.92s)]
*  after yesterday afternoon, pagers started exploding all over Lebanon. They exploded, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=50.64s)]
*  we know now, in Syria as well. The pagers beat before they went off. As a result, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=55.04s)]
*  a lot of the injuries are to the hands and fingers of the people who reach for their pagers. Injuries [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=59.6s)]
*  are to the eyes and faces of people who looked at their pagers, and of course there are injuries [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=63.72s)]
*  to the waist and pocket area where most people would carry their pagers. Now, according to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=67.84s)]
*  reports, it was Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah himself who ordered the use of pagers because [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  he thought it was too easy for Israel to track or hack into smartphones. Security experts say [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=76.4s)]
*  the explosions were more powerful than just a battery, so at some point the pagers were sabotaged [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=81.96s)]
*  and explosive charges as well as switches were installed on each device. The pagers were a [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  Taiwanese brand, Gold Apollo, but the chairman of that company says they licensed the name to a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=92.91999999999999s)]
*  company out of Europe called BAC who says he says made the pagers. I reached out to BAC no response. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=97.0s)]
*  The Associated Press is reporting that BAC is starting to look like a shell company. The U.S. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=103.32s)]
*  says they had no heads up warning about the attack. I can tell you that the U.S. was not [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=109.0s)]
*  involved in it. The U.S. was not aware of this incident in advance and at this point we're [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=114.76s)]
*  gathering information. Hezbollah blames Israel for the pager attack with a statement that reads, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=120.28s)]
*  in part, the treacherous and criminal enemy will surely receive his just retribution for the sinful [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  aggression from where it counts and from where it doesn't count. The north of Israel remains on high [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=131.96s)]
*  alert now for retaliation from Hezbollah. Israeli media is reporting that paratroopers from the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=137.32s)]
*  elite 98th division have left Gaza and are redeploying to the north of Israel. More than [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=142.2s)]
*  60,000 Israelis have already evacuated from the north as rockets and drones are fired almost every [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=147.64s)]
*  day and Israel predictably is not saying anything about the pager attack. Guys? And Mike Tobin, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=152.6s)]
*  of course, Israel's not saying anything but we presume it was Israel. It just goes to show you [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=159.56s)]
*  that they were able to coordinate this so well somewhere between where the pagers left a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=165.4s)]
*  warehouse and before it wound up at Hezbollah HQ somebody was able to install one or two ounces of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=171.96s)]
*  detonating explosive in each one of them. But it just goes to show you that these Israelis [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=180.28s)]
*  have got people probably either on the inside or they can surveil what they're doing at Hezbollah. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=186.52s)]
*  Well, well there's new information that BAC looks like it might be a shell company. Don't [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=192.44s)]
*  overlook the possibility that they created the company for the purpose of producing bogus pagers [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=198.04s)]
*  with with explosives. Oh that would be crafted. So I'm curious Mike, the United States government [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=203.96s)]
*  is saying that we didn't know about it or had no involvement with it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=208.6s)]
*  Well that's what we're getting out of the state department and out of out of D.C. and obviously [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=215.8s)]
*  something like this would have to be as top secret as top secret gets because once word got [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=220.52s)]
*  out that it could happen it would fail. In fact there is a different reporting coming out now [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  that the Hezbollah operatives started to get suspicious of their pagers and that's why they [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=231.4s)]
*  were detonated yesterday. Obviously if Hezbollah was aware that they had explosive devices that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=235.88s)]
*  they were carrying around with them they'd get rid of them and the attack wouldn't be effective. So [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=240.44s)]
*  at least if these reports are accurate it was detonate them yesterday or don't detonate them [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=245.32000000000002s)]
*  at all. So I might understand Mike if I remember correctly since the attack on those Hezbollah [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=250.2s)]
*  higher-ups about a month ago as well as the killing of Hania in Iran we're waiting for some type of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=255.88s)]
*  retribution from both sides and Israel is braced for that and not only have they not gotten hit [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=263.0s)]
*  they've attacked massively in this way. Have I missed anything or is that really the cycle of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=268.59999999999997s)]
*  events? No that really does seem to be the cycle of events. Everyone is waiting. There's a lot of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  tension about what Iran's retaliation will be for the assassination of Ismail Hania. I haven't seen [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=280.12s)]
*  it yet but they can do that in their own time. All right thank you so much. It's interesting that the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=286.04s)]
*  leader of Hezbollah decided to give them pagers because he thought they were safer. Right. Turns [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=291.72s)]
*  out they weren't and Israel was able to to access these pages before they were distributed. That [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=295.8s)]
*  means someone inside Hezbollah probably is giving this information to Israel. Or Israel's just [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=301.0s)]
*  surveilling. Or Israel was able to anticipate where Hania would stay when he went to Iran. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=305.64s)]
*  He went there for the funeral or the inauguration of the new president. They had to anticipate the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=312.36s)]
*  townhouse or whatever he was in and they blew it up. Then they had to anticipate [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=317.56s)]
*  Nasrallah switching from the cell phone to the pager, come up with a pager company [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=322.28s)]
*  which is subsidiary of a Taiwanese company and then be the engineers of it. I mean there's [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=328.68s)]
*  something in between we don't know. It's a puzzle we're not supposed to solve. I do find it very [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=334.84s)]
*  interesting that the Mossad who is the closest intelligence agency to the United States intelligence [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=339.0s)]
*  either denying it and we knew or they didn't feel comfortable sharing this information with [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=346.52s)]
*  our government. That definitely sends a message. So right. Well it was it was something the cover [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=351.08s)]
*  of the New York Post says beep beep boom. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilme. And I'm Ainsley [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD4Eoycima0&t=357.55999999999995s)]
