# Brothers who staged Jussie Smollett hoax: This was a 'real injustice'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s)
*  Let's bring in two guys right in the middle of this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=0.0s)]
*  Ola and Abel Oshindaro. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=2.0s)]
*  We appreciate you guys joining us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=4.36s)]
*  We saw you on the special recreating this big hoax. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=5.8s)]
*  First off, your thought about this decision from the courts. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=9.16s)]
*  We were taken aback initially, not [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=15.48s)]
*  because of the Supreme Court's decision, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=18.16s)]
*  but because Jussie never admitted guilt. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=20.72s)]
*  We understand that he has due process rights [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=24.44s)]
*  and double jeopardy and is not allowed in America. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=27.36s)]
*  However, Jussie should have admitted guilt, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=32.24s)]
*  and that's where we stand. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=34.76s)]
*  So the real injustice here was the sweetheart deal [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=37.6s)]
*  he was given by Kim Foxx's office [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=41.44s)]
*  at the beginning of all this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=43.8s)]
*  Here's what Kim Foxx said yesterday, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  defending the plea deal. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=48.36s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  The amount of attention to a filing of a false police [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=51.6s)]
*  report charge and the energy that resulted from that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=55.08s)]
*  is something I won't understand. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=59.56s)]
*  It's important to note, is Dan Webb [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=61.0s)]
*  knew all along that this was not a legitimate prosecution. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=62.92s)]
*  So I'm grateful that the court has finally put this to rest. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=67.28s)]
*  So Abel, your thoughts? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=72.6s)]
*  She says, what's the big hype? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=75.32s)]
*  He did a network. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=76.92s)]
*  He did all these network interviews. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=77.88s)]
*  He said how white MAGA people are out to kill him [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  because he was gay and black. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=83.64s)]
*  We're in the middle of the George Floyd riots. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=85.36s)]
*  This was a blowtorch to blow up American society [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=87.76s)]
*  and further that cause and make him more famous. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=91.68s)]
*  That's the big deal, isn't it? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=94.84s)]
*  Yes, it is a big deal. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=97.16s)]
*  And the problem is, if it was a regular small Joe [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=99.04s)]
*  John Doe or Ola Uchundairo, he would not get that deal. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=102.68s)]
*  Jussie got that deal because he has influence and power. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=107.72s)]
*  So it shows that there are two different citizens [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=111.0s)]
*  in America, one with power and one without. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=113.48s)]
*  And that's why he got that sweetheart deal. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=116.48s)]
*  Have you talked to him since, Ola? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=120.2s)]
*  Did he ever pay you guys? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  We have not spoken to him since. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=124.48s)]
*  Yes, he did pay us at first. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=127.36s)]
*  He still owes us $500. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=129.36s)]
*  But I don't think we're ever going to see that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=132.08s)]
*  Abel, go ahead. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=134.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=135.68s)]
*  It wasn't about the money. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=136.44s)]
*  It was not about the money at all. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=138.12s)]
*  It was more so us helping out a friend. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=140.08s)]
*  Do you know anyone that believes him? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=143.72s)]
*  Do you know anyone that believes Jussie Smollett [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=146.56s)]
*  was telling the truth, Ola? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=148.96s)]
*  Not a single soul. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=151.84s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  I do see people online that still has his back. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=155.0s)]
*  But no. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  In my immediate circle, nobody believes him. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=161.12s)]
*  Yeah, not even Pinocchio. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  Abel, let me ask you something. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=166.56s)]
*  When he told you about it, did you [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=167.84s)]
*  realize this was an absolute farce that would never come off, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  that no one would believe it? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=173.12s)]
*  Yes, I did believe that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=175.84s)]
*  However, he made it seem like this is what Hollywood does. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=177.52s)]
*  He mentioned Kim Kardashian. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  During that time, she had a incident [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=184.36s)]
*  where she got robbed and kidnapped in France. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=187.08s)]
*  And he said that was made up. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  That was fake. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=192.28s)]
*  So that's what I was thinking. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=193.36s)]
*  Oh, this is what Hollywood does. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  My brother and I are professional actors. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=197.2s)]
*  And we thought, oh, this is our introduction into Hollywood. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=198.96s)]
*  And actually, we go further in our book [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=203.0s)]
*  that we just released, Bigger Than Jesse, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=206.12s)]
*  the reason why Jesse might have actually performed this hoax. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=209.2s)]
*  And who? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=213.84s)]
*  That's a very important question that leads us to the why. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=214.84s)]
*  The who. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=218.44s)]
*  Who is involved. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  Who put him up to it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=219.88s)]
*  And obviously, I think he's unemployable, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=221.56s)]
*  even though he beats it on this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  Abel, you're boxing, right? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=226.92s)]
*  You're a pro. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=229.12s)]
*  You want to fight Jake Paul? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=229.76s)]
*  Oh, definitely, especially after that rubbish [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  that happened with Mike Tyson. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  Yes, Jake Paul, we're going to come after you [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=237.48s)]
*  and we're going to beat you up. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  Maybe do a tag team. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=240.76s)]
*  I'll take Logan. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=242.16s)]
*  Logan Paul versus Ola. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=243.2s)]
*  I'll bet on you guys. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=246.2s)]
*  What did you think of the Tyson fight, Abel? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=247.48s)]
*  The Tyson fight, I think it was a... [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=253.92s)]
*  I think it did a disservice to boxing [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=256.68s)]
*  because Tyson should have definitely [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  went in there to kill him. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=261.32s)]
*  Now, we're tainted on Tyson's memory, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=263.08s)]
*  on who he was as a boxer. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, my little cousin has to look at Tyson [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=268.12s)]
*  as being this wimpy guy that Jake Paul beat. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=271.0s)]
*  I don't think Tyson even fought, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=275.76s)]
*  but I can't wait to get your book. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  You have rigged answers to big questions. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=279.2s)]
*  Bigger Than Jesse, and we look forward [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  to following both of your career. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=283.12s)]
*  And everybody, go to One Nation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=284.52s)]

*  Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWz4BEX1Y0s&t=292.20000000000005s)]
