# BREAKING: Democrat senator meets with suspected MS-13 gang leader in El Salvador
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20)
*  All right, Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen meeting face to face with suspected MS-13 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=0.0s)]
*  gang member in El Salvador. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=7.96s)]
*  Madeline Rivera is live in Washington with the latest for us. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=10.36s)]
*  Hey, Maddie. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=13.16s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=14.16s)]
*  Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen says he'll give more details about that meeting when [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=15.16s)]
*  he gets back to the U.S. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=18.6s)]
*  Van Hollen posting this photo on X saying he spoke into Abrego Garcia's wife and given [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=20.56s)]
*  her Abrego Garcia's message of love. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=24.92s)]
*  Fighting against MS-13 for probably longer than Donald Trump even heard about MS-13. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=29.88s)]
*  They're trying to make this case about Kilmar all about MS-13. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=39.44s)]
*  The judge in the case has said they've not provided substantial or any significant evidence [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=47.4s)]
*  to back up their claim. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  El Salvador's President Ibukele is mocking the meeting, saying in part Kilmar Abrego [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  Garcia has miraculously risen from the death camps and torture. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=62.32s)]
*  He also suggests he's still not looking to release Abrego Garcia, saying he gets the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=66.96s)]
*  honor of staying in El Salvador's custody. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=70.8s)]
*  Per the New York Post, a conservative watchdog, the American Accountability Foundation is [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=73.8s)]
*  demanding an ethics probe into Van Hollen's El Salvador trip. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=77.68s)]
*  The organization's president says Senator Van Hollen decided that he would use Senate [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=81.52s)]
*  funds to fly to El Salvador and advocate for an enemy of the United States. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=85.48s)]
*  Here's President Trump talking about the case yesterday. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=90.36s)]
*  I have to refer again to the lawyers. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  I'll have to do what they ask me to do. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=95.92s)]
*  I had heard that there were a lot of things about a certain gentleman, perhaps it was [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  that gentleman, that would make that case be a case that's easily winnable on appeal. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  So we'll just have to see. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=109.92s)]
*  I'm going to have to respond to the lawyers. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=110.92s)]
*  On Thursday, an appeals court denied the Justice Department's request to block a federal judge's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=113.38s)]
*  order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=117.88s)]
*  The case could ultimately land back in the hands of the Supreme Court. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=120.83999999999999s)]
*  Lawrence Ainsley and Brian. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=124.94s)]
*  Well, thanks so much. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=126.66s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=127.86s)]
*  So it's unbelievable that he feels good sitting against a guy that beat his wife twice because [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=129.14s)]
*  they say the case is closed. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=134.1s)]
*  It doesn't mean he didn't do it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=135.1s)]
*  Number two is he was picked up wearing a bull shirt, hanging out with MS-13. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=136.78s)]
*  Unless it was Meet the Civilian Day, this is called what MS-13 does. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=141.38s)]
*  They don't have cards, but they have certain actions. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  That's why two separate judges said he's a member of MS-13. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=151.78s)]
*  Also, the trafficking case that was brought up yesterday confounded a Tennessean that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=155.38s)]
*  said he was moving seven other people from Texas to Maryland, one of which they think [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=160.57999999999998s)]
*  was on a terror watch list, driving without a license on top of that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=165.57999999999998s)]
*  And do we even know what job he had before he was picked up? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=169.46s)]
*  So since we did the show yesterday, DHS has now confirmed their story that it did happen [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=172.3s)]
*  with the Tennessee State Police. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=178.46s)]
*  I guess it brings me to know, Joyce Sanders, Brian, but you were right yesterday. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=180.34s)]
*  I mean, you talked off air and I said, do you really think they're going to stick with [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=183.58s)]
*  this after all of this information beating his wife, the immigration jury, two judges [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=187.26000000000002s)]
*  saying that he's a part of MS-13 and then the new information about him trafficking? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=193.10000000000002s)]
*  And you said they would. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=197.08s)]
*  And this is going to be the image, Ainsley, during the next campaign. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  The Democrats stand with the people that beat their wives that are illegals and MS-13 members [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=202.34s)]
*  and the president, Donald J. Trump, stands with the victim's family. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=207.96s)]
*  I still cannot believe that they think this is a winning message. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  The majority of the people in America, they voted for Donald Trump. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=216.08s)]
*  They all said their issue was the high prices under Joe Biden and then immigration. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=220.56s)]
*  That was everyone's, those were the top two issues on the campaign trail. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=227.36s)]
*  This guy's going down and the House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Green said, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=231.04s)]
*  wasting taxpayer dollars, visiting a gang member, reported domestic abusers, if, abuser, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=235.84s)]
*  if Democrats care so much about defending this individual, they can use their own personal [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=241.56s)]
*  credit cards, not taxpayer money, to virtue signal their radical base. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=245.52s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=249.95999999999998s)]
*  It's the radical, radical, radical left that is for this kind of thing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  And Stephen Miller talked about how Van Hollen, when one of his own constituents, when Rachel [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=254.04s)]
*  Morin was killed, when she was raped and beaten to death and murdered by an illegal alien, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=258.36s)]
*  that Joe Biden set free. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=263.52s)]
*  Not once did Van Hollen call his constituent, Rachel's mom, and say, I'm sorry. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=266.84s)]
*  Could it be bothered to express condolences or any sympathies? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=271.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=274.48s)]
*  And if he really cared, he says, I know more about MS-13 than Donald Trump. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=275.48s)]
*  Well, show it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=278.2s)]
*  Of course, because when you have somebody who's a victim of it, maybe pick up the phone. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=279.28s)]
*  I love what the president of El Salvador said. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=282.96s)]
*  He said, well, miraculously, he's risen from death camps and torture. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=285.36s)]
*  Now sipping margaritas with Senator Van Hollen in the paradise of El Salvador. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=289.8s)]
*  So now you got what you wanted. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  Other things interesting, he told ICE when he was picked up, I ultimately put on that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=296.56s)]
*  plane, that he said he did not fear, he isn't afraid to go back to Central America. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=300.0s)]
*  In 2019, he told the court that he expressed fear if he ever returned to El Salvador. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=306.20000000000005s)]
*  So is he suddenly got courage, or is he trying to get asylum and to do that you have to express [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=311.76000000000005s)]
*  fear? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=316.48s)]
*  Here's his story and Victor Davis Hanson on what the Democrats are doing. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=317.48s)]
*  It's kind of a disturbing pattern. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=322.6s)]
*  This Democratic Jacobin Party, they have all these iconic people, they want to die on the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=325.12s)]
*  altar of their freedom. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  It's not just Mr. Garcia, it's Mahud Khalil, the pro-Hamas spokesman. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=332.64s)]
*  He's an iconic figure. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=341.79999999999995s)]
*  It's Mr. Mangione, he's an iconic figure. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  Even on social media, Carmelo Anthony, who's an alleged killer, is an iconic figure. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  They fixate on these people and you get two things from it all, that they have no moral [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=356.48s)]
*  bearings and they don't care about the victims, they don't care about that. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=363.24s)]
*  And then they're in this, I don't know what you'd call it, kind of a fog or an echo chamber. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=367.36s)]
*  They really think that people agree with them or resonate. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=372.44s)]
*  I just really think that the Democratic Party is lost right now. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=376.36s)]
*  They're completely losing their minds. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=379.52s)]
*  When you look at all the swing sticks, going for the guy that you guys got rid of before [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=383.96s)]
*  and he comes back and makes the biggest comeback in political history, you would think something [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  would register to their brain, maybe we're doing something wrong. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  Instead, they double down on every 90-10 issue there is. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=398.92s)]
*  And then Van Hollen wrote on X, I have called his wife Jennifer to pass along his message [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=404.32s)]
*  of love. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=408.91999999999996s)]
*  I thought message of love. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=409.92s)]
*  He loved her so much that she had to go to authorities and say that he threw a boot at [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=411.76s)]
*  her and he punched her in the face, that he knocked the laptop off the bed because she [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=416.0s)]
*  wouldn't get off, she couldn't sleep. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=420.52000000000004s)]
*  So she was on the laptop, knocked it off the bed and she was fearful for her son, gave [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=422.36s)]
*  her a black eye. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=428.0s)]
*  That's the woman that she loved. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=429.0s)]
*  Two different incidents. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=430.48s)]
*  So the Washington Post did a poll and they said, America in 2016, are you for deporting [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=431.48s)]
*  all illegal immigrants? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=435.94s)]
*  Only 36% of the country. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=437.44s)]
*  This is all illegal immigrants, let alone MS-13. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=438.94s)]
*  2025, the number's up to 56%. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=440.94s)]
*  And then Howard Enton of the CNN pollster said only 2% of the American people regret [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=444.26s)]
*  voting for Donald Trump, which is astounding. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au7wvOg1X20&t=450.26s)]
