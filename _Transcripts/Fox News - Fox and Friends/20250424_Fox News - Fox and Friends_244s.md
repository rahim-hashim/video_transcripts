# Barbara Corcoran: This is causing tremendous uncertainty
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14)
*  Today at the White House, they are set to hold more high-stakes trade talks, this time [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=0.0s)]
*  with South Korea. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=5.26s)]
*  It comes as brand new polls highlight voters' concerns with tariffs, with more people feeling [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=6.34s)]
*  they are hurting the economy and jobs here in the United States. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about what it takes to make a deal. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=15.38s)]
*  Shark Tank investor and Corcoran Group founder Barbara Corcoran joins us right now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=18.48s)]
*  Thanks, Steve. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=23.68s)]
*  Good to have you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=24.68s)]
*  During the commercial, she was talking to me a little bit about how they have to edit [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=25.68s)]
*  out when the Shark Tank people talk dirty. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=29.08s)]
*  You weren't supposed to say that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=30.56s)]
*  Oh, sorry. Never mind. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=31.56s)]
*  Apparently that's true, though. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=32.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=33.56s)]
*  Let's talk. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=34.56s)]
*  Some people are cursing at the stock market when they have watched these wild gyrations [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=35.56s)]
*  with the tariffs the last couple of days, good days. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=39.36s)]
*  What do you make of the Wheeler deal, and because you're a Wheeler dealer, that the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=43.24s)]
*  president is doing with essentially the whole planet? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=47.4s)]
*  Well, I'm not a Wheeler dealer, by the way, but it causes uncertainty. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=50.2s)]
*  It causes uncertainty in the commercial market. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=55.08s)]
*  Such companies aren't committing to long leases. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  It causes tremendous uncertainty in the buyer market, buying new homes, buying old homes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=59.6s)]
*  Right now, last month, we had almost 14 percent of all contracts fall apart, which is very [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=64.72s)]
*  unusual. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=69.6s)]
*  Last time we saw that was right on the heels of COVID. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=70.6s)]
*  People got scared, but then the market came back by storm. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=73.08s)]
*  But that's exactly what's going to happen here. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=75.92s)]
*  We have so much hesitation in the market, and it's giving us an opportunity for buyers [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=77.48s)]
*  to make a good deal. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=82.5s)]
*  That's how I feel about it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=83.6s)]
*  But during times of trouble, you know, you look back in history and it's like, if I [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=85.36s)]
*  would have bought when it was way down, I'd be loaded right now. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=89.24s)]
*  So what you're doing is you're saying, OK, it's going to hurt right now, but suck it [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=92.52s)]
*  up, you'll make money. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=97.96s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=99.2s)]
*  In times of trouble, it's the last thing a buyer wants to do is to commit to a new house. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=100.2s)]
*  They're going to be saddled with it for 20 years. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=104.16s)]
*  They're so afraid that only a shrewd buyer usually jumps into the market. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=106.12s)]
*  OK, speaking of new houses, there's a survey that's come out, I think, by Bankrate. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=109.6s)]
*  It shows that in certain markets, it's actually cheaper to rent a house or an apartment or [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=114.52s)]
*  whatever, a condo, than buying a house. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=120.96s)]
*  It's actually in every market. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=123.8s)]
*  All the 50 leading markets of the nation, it's cheaper to rent right now than to buy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=125.24s)]
*  But think about that for a moment. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=129.76s)]
*  So you rent the house, you have a smaller expense every month, but you don't get the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=131.12s)]
*  appreciation, you don't get something to leave your kids, you don't get the satisfaction [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=135.44s)]
*  of owning the place you live. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=139.2s)]
*  It's very different. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=140.76s)]
*  And the tariffs and the economy are kind of impacting all of that right now as well. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=142.92s)]
*  It's the main card. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=149.04s)]
*  People don't like to buy in uncertain times. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  People worry. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=152.76s)]
*  People at home are worried about their futures and nervous about everything. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=153.76s)]
*  And the last thing they do is want to make a large commitment to anything. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=156.83999999999997s)]
*  They hesitate. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=160.66s)]
*  But again, there's a hesitation right now that I'm sure is short-lived. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  It's not going to last forever when things settle down. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=165.76s)]
*  Well, and the president has even said that he's got a vision for how the world order [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=168.12s)]
*  should reshuffle itself. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=172.64s)]
*  He's reshuffling the deck regarding trade. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=174.4s)]
*  He's got a big picture idea. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=177.16s)]
*  And he said there's going to be some pain. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  This is just a period of pain. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=180.14s)]
*  And we hope sooner than later it's over. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  But people don't believe it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=184.2s)]
*  People have had so much uncertainty, they are afraid to trust. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=186.28s)]
*  So all those claims could sound good, but they don't make a big difference in the American [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=190.0s)]
*  mind. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=194.56s)]
*  So you're best friends as you advise them whether to buy a house, whether to invest [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=195.72s)]
*  money, do any of that stuff. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=199.96s)]
*  What are you telling them about right now? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=200.96s)]
*  If you're taking your money out of the stock market, put it in real estate. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=201.96s)]
*  It's a much more stable environment. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=204.64s)]
*  Of course, because I love real estate. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=206.44s)]
*  But I'm doing it myself. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=208.2s)]
*  I have taken so much money out of the stock market. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=209.4s)]
*  I've gotten great deals this month. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=211.72s)]
*  The deals that turned me away four months ago are coming back to me. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=213.64s)]
*  So I know it's a good time to buy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=216.24s)]
*  And think about it, the president is a real estate guy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  So he should know best. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=220.72s)]
*  You should know best. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=222.48s)]
*  You'll have to check out the stock prices of his building. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=223.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=225.88s)]
*  We're going to take a time out. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=226.88s)]
*  Next up, during the commercial, will you tell me about Mark Cuban? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=228.32s)]
*  Sure, I will. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=230.44s)]
*  Okay, good. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=231.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=232.44s)]
*  In the meantime, Barbara, thank you very much. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=233.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5X5p06IL14&t=234.44s)]
