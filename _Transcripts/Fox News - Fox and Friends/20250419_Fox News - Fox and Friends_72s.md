# Holy Week Clash: Trump reacts to Biden’s Easter Trans Day proclamation #foxnews #trump #easter
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM)
*  It's just a beautiful time of the year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=0.0s)]
*  And I remember that with Biden. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=2.16s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Look, he was the worst president in the history of our country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  And we've had some bad ones. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=8.76s)]
*  But there was never anybody like this. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=10.44s)]
*  I don't even know if he was president because he didn't know where the hell he was. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=12.0s)]
*  Yeah, fair point. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=15.56s)]
*  Maybe Biden didn't even know it was Trans Visibility Day. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=17.36s)]
*  Or Easter, for that matter. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=19.72s)]
*  Or Easter. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=20.96s)]
*  Definitely not. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=21.96s)]
*  And we've talked about, you know, you just spoke with Lauren Green about how people are [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=22.96s)]
*  coming out in droves and declaring their faith. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=26.12s)]
*  And I think what we saw under the prior administration was, or actually know what we saw, was a formalized [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=29.48s)]
*  persecution and prosecution of Judeo-Christian culture, of Christians. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=34.92s)]
*  We saw weaponized DOJ. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=40.32s)]
*  We saw protesters literally being prosecuted, octogenarians being prosecuted for protesting [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=42.46s)]
*  against abortions, worshippers not feeling safe going to Latin Mass because they knew [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=48.0s)]
*  they were on an FBI watch list. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=52.72s)]
*  I mean, it was a horrible appropriation of our tax dollars, stamped at the top with Trans [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=54.56s)]
*  Visibility Day on Easter, on the day of resurrection, on the day that Jesus is risen. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=59.56s)]
*  And now it feels as if we can finally worship freely. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnNRJjBDfM&t=65.16s)]
