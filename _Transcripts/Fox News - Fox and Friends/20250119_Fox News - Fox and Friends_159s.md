# 'CLEAN DIVESTMENT': This is the 'best answer' for TikTok, expert says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ)
*  All right, TikTok officially going dark overnight, but Trump could step in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  A message on the app saying, quote, we are fortunate that President Trump has indicated [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  that he will work with us on a solution. So here with more, a senior research associate [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=9.24s)]
*  at the Heritage Foundation, Daniel Cochran. Daniel, thanks for coming on. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=14.16s)]
*  It's so good to be here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=18.0s)]
*  Thank you. How does this all play out? How can he make sure that the many people who [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=20.0s)]
*  are on TikTok are happy, but yet our security is not at risk? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=23.2s)]
*  Well, look, the bottom line is it didn't have to be this way. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  TikTok, Congress didn't ban TikTok. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  Congress simply said TikTok can't be owned and controlled by a company, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=33.4s)]
*  which is operating under the influence of the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=37.8s)]
*  The simple and clearest answer is a clean divestment. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=41.68s)]
*  That's, I think, perhaps one reason why the president has asked for another 90 days. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=44.76s)]
*  He's he's considering an executive order to that effect tomorrow. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  And if that happens, I think the best answer is a clean divestment so that we're not [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=52.16s)]
*  sending so many Americans data to China. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=55.92s)]
*  And how can he do that and make sure China is not stealing our information? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=58.56s)]
*  Look, ByteDance controls the algorithm that is the bread and butter of TikTok. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  What has to happen is ByteDance needs to license that algorithm to the U.S. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=66.8s)]
*  version of the app, the U.S. company that needs to operate completely independently [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=72.0s)]
*  of China and Chinese companies. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=76.12s)]
*  And if it does that, that'll that'll protect Americans national security. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=78.12s)]
*  OK, I think we have a sound bite from the CEO of TikTok [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=81.56s)]
*  on how he's going to work with Trump. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=85.36s)]
*  I'm being told we don't have the sound that he says. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=87.2s)]
*  I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=89.0s)]
*  that keeps TikTok available in the United States. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=92.2s)]
*  This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=94.44s)]
*  We are grateful and pleased to have the support of the president who truly understands our platform. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=98.44s)]
*  Now, the current administration, KJP, was saying she thinks that this is a stunt. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=103.4s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=107.84s)]
*  Well, look, I think TikTok has a long track record of engaging in sort of questionable [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  behavior to avoid scrutiny. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=113.68s)]
*  For years, they said they weren't sending Americans data to China, but it turns out that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=115.92s)]
*  they were they were they were holding they were they were storing the data, sensitive [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=120.16s)]
*  data of American creators on Chinese servers. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  And it turns out they were collecting sensitive data about topics like abortion and gun [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=127.72s)]
*  control ahead of our elections and sending it back to China. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=131.88s)]
*  So TikTok has lied before and they're going to lie again. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=134.56s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=137.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yep. And Donald Trump says that he will most likely give the app a 90 day extension [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=137.96s)]
*  on Monday. So we'll see. Daniel, thank you so much. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=142.92s)]
*  Thank you. It's exciting to be here, isn't it? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  Beautiful shot behind us. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK-dbKMwmKQ&t=147.35999999999999s)]
