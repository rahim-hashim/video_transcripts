# 'Vindicated!': Peter Doocy, hosts detail explosive report on 'diminished' Biden
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8)
*  This is a huge story, Tiff. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=0.0s)]
*  It would be number one if it wasn't for this ongoing budget issue. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=1.6s)]
*  An explosive report in the Wall Street Journal underlines everything we've been reporting and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=4.4s)]
*  saying. It's shedding light on how the White House functioned or didn't function with a diminished [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=8.08s)]
*  Biden in charge. This is a crazy story and it's just coming out even though we've been reporting [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=13.92s)]
*  on it for years. Peter, he knows about it. He joins us from Washington. Peter, you asked the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=19.2s)]
*  questions but now the liberal press is starting to catch on. Yes, remember cheap fakes? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=23.2s)]
*  When we were told over and over that things that appeared to show President Biden had lost a step [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=30.08s)]
*  were somehow manipulated media, well they were not. And now we have some new insight into how [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=36.56s)]
*  Biden aides covered for him and they just have to make it through one more month of this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=42.88s)]
*  You prepare to leave the White House. Any other regrets that you have? Anything you wish you would [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  have done differently? Well, I guess if I thought a lot about it, it would be something I'd done [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=54.88s)]
*  specifically then but not generically. The Wall Street Journal's headline is this. How the White [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=60.56s)]
*  House functioned with a diminished Biden in charge and diminished dates back to the first year in [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=67.04s)]
*  office. Quote, if the president was having an off day, meetings could be scrapped altogether. On one [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=72.64s)]
*  such occasion in the spring of 2021, a national security official explained to another aide why [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=77.2s)]
*  a meeting needed to be rescheduled. He has good days and bad days and today was a bad day so we're [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=82.16s)]
*  going to address this tomorrow, the former aide recalled the official saying. In the small windows [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=86.96s)]
*  we did see President Biden, there were falls on stairs, on stage, on a bike but we were continually [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=92.08s)]
*  assured everything was okay. Right after the debate you insisted that President Biden is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  extraordinarily strong. Given where we are now, do you have any regrets about what you told the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=106.32s)]
*  American people? No, not at all. Not at all. I talk to President Biden, you know, regularly, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=112.16s)]
*  usually several times in a week. His mental acuity is great, it's fine, it's as good as it's been [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  over the years. Do you think the president should undergo some cognitive testing? No, I, I, I, I, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=125.35999999999999s)]
*  to the extent that we're having this conversation, I don't see any need to do that as it relates to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  Biden. Last year when I asked the press secretary about a book claiming the president himself [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=135.2s)]
*  felt like staff was treating him like a baby, I was told it was a ridiculous claim. This year, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=140.64s)]
*  when I asked who is actually running the country, I was assured President Biden is and when I read [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=146.0s)]
*  part of the Robert Herr report to the president himself about how they think, the DOJ, that he's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=151.6s)]
*  a well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory, the president said that his memory was so bad he let [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=156.48s)]
*  me speak, which was funny. So there was just enough of those Joe Biden of years past moments [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=163.52s)]
*  for Dems to stand by their man for a whole term. Back to you. Didn't he call you a one-horse pony? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=169.36s)]
*  Yeah, and that was before he even got in. Right. He meant one trick pony. Son of a something else. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=175.84s)]
*  You were asking about Hunter. Peter, you've been asking these questions for four years. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=182.4s)]
*  You've been vindicated. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=187.2s)]
*  Ah, yeah. Thank you. Okay. Well then, it's been fun. Time for a new president to come in. That'll [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=190.32s)]
*  be fun too. Well, Robert Herr's been vindicated too, hasn't he? So what about all those people [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  that had the... What about the Wall Street Journal in August when they wrote a similar story and were [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  eviscerated? What about this Chris Colizza goes, I should have pushed Hunter. They would get very [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=208.72s)]
*  defensive and really go after you aggressively if you asked about the president's work ethic, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=215.76s)]
*  appearances, statements. Well, a lot of this was just out there in plain sight, whether it was [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=221.92s)]
*  something that was at an event or a clip that they were putting out that was heavily edited, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  or if you looked at some of these transcripts of fundraisers that the president was going to where [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  all we had was a printed transcript. And he was telling these wealthy Democratic donors [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=242.08s)]
*  about a European leader that he had just spoken to who had been dead for a decade. And so a lot [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=247.28s)]
*  of it was right there, but we were told by people that we are supposed to take their word for it if [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=253.36s)]
*  they are standing at the White House podium, that we should not believe what we were seeing, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=260.88s)]
*  we should not believe what we were hearing. And what's really interesting is that it took [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  almost four full years, we're a month shy, January 20th is a month from today, we're a month shy of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=270.72s)]
*  President Biden leaving office, it took this long for the Wall Street Journal to find these [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=277.36s)]
*  50 people that they talked to. I would bet that January 21st people will start putting their names [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  to those. It's gonna get worse. 500 people. Yeah, we forgot if we really had no president for four [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=289.36s)]
*  years. Can I just say, just please, thank you, Peter, I just want to play devil's advocate here. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  We've all had an elderly family member that's gone through this before. At what point- We saw the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=299.76s)]
*  signs. We saw the sign. We all did, and we used to have to do the whole disclaimer, we're not a [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=305.76s)]
*  doctor, even though we can see it. At what point is it his responsibility and not the people [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=309.68s)]
*  that surround him? I don't know what's left of him. I mean, because when I think of elderly people [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=316.48s)]
*  in my family, at some point you take the keys away. Right. It's a tough decision. But you kept [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=320.64s)]
*  putting them behind the wheel. That's what I'm saying. And Joe was in more counties than he was, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=326.48s)]
*  and the staffers were told, don't play that up. Don't talk about that. In 2020. That's right. But [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  to your point, great point, but here's the thing, they got away with it for four years, so they're [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  thinking, all right, have him run for reelection. Steve, do you believe that? Let's get another- In [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=340.56s)]
*  light of all this and that- Yes. They actually thought they could pull this up. The tight circle. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=344.0s)]
*  Here's why, it's more than just a talking point. This affected lives. That's right. The pull out [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=348.32s)]
*  of Afghanistan, the way he did that, cost Americans lives. And if you're their parents [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=352.88s)]
*  and you know that the staffers behind the pearly gates knew that he were behind the White House, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  the columns, not pearly gates, it's God. Those are other staffers. Yeah. If you knew that he was [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=363.44s)]
*  having a problem and they all knew about it and he's still in charge, I would be so irate as one [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=369.12s)]
*  of their parents. Did Vladimir Putin take an assessment when they met one on one and he said, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=374.8s)]
*  I'm going into Ukraine? Because they knew who was dealing with it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=380.8s)]
*  Think about the thousands that died. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XO55tR5Nj8&t=383.84000000000003s)]
