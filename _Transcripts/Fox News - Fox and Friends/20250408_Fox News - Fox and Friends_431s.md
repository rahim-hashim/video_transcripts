# China vows to fight Trump's tariffs 'to the end': 'BLACKMAIL'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A)
*  Let's talk tariffs. The trade battle between the U.S. and China is ramping up with Beijing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=0.0s)]
*  promising to fight to the end. That is really amping up. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=4.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a scary sound. And today on Capitol Hill, the U.S. trade representative is [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  going to testify in defense of the tariffs that have rattled global markets going on the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=11.4s)]
*  second week. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=16.96s)]
*  Brooke Singman joins us now with all the details. Hey, Brooke. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=18.96s)]
*  Hey, guys. Good morning. James and Greer will appear before the Senate Finance Committee [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=20.96s)]
*  today to defend Trump's tariffs. So he will say in prepared remarks, quote, our large [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=24.96s)]
*  and persistent trade deficit has been over 30 years in the making and it will not be [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=29.76s)]
*  resolved overnight. But all of this is in the right direction. This adjustment may be [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=34.72s)]
*  challenging at times. It is a moment of drastic overdue change. But I am confident the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=39.44s)]
*  American people will rise to the occasion as they have done before. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=44.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump is threatening to impose a 50 percent tariff on imports from [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=49.16s)]
*  China starting tomorrow. That is, if Beijing fails to withdraw its 34 percent retaliatory [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  tariffs by today. But China is not backing down. It's Commerce Ministry warning that, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=59.64s)]
*  quote, the U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=64.76s)]
*  and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the U.S. China will never accept this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=69.92s)]
*  If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end. If Trump follows through, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=75.68s)]
*  the total cumulative tariff on China would be a staggering 104 percent. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=81.12s)]
*  Despite the sharp sell-offs on Wall Street and global markets, President Trump, though, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  is calling for patience. And he's come up with a new name for tariff critics posting [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  on Truth Social, quote, the United States has a chance to do something that should have [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  been done decades ago. Don't be weak. Don't be stupid. Don't be a panicking. A new party [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=100.16s)]
*  and stupid people. Be strong, courageous and patient and greatness will be the result. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=106.96s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=111.96s)]
*  Ever heard the word panicking before? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=112.96s)]
*  It's an invention. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=115.96s)]
*  Panic in. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=118.96s)]
*  It's a combo of weak and stupid. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=119.96s)]
*  Don't be one. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=121.96s)]
*  So the Dow futures, thank you, Brooke. The Dow futures are up 700 points. There's a sense [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=122.96s)]
*  that maybe the president's looking to do a deal and Scott Besson indicated yesterday, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=127.32s)]
*  Hey, I am looking to do that and I'm going to give Japan first dibs. They contacted us first. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=132.36s)]
*  And then on top of that, the EU said, I have a great idea. Let's just make it zero tariffs. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=139.36s)]
*  But the president said no to that. We've got too many other imbalances between cars and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=144.36s)]
*  not taking our cows and our meat. We'll deal with that. But it shows things are going in [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=149.36s)]
*  the right direction. Maybe that's what the market thinks. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=154.36s)]
*  Well, it's interesting too. Yesterday, did you hear what he said about Iran? He has negotiations [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=156.36s)]
*  with Iran coming up this Saturday. Yes, they have a high level negotiation with Iran on [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=160.36s)]
*  a potential nuclear deal. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=166.36s)]
*  Well, and yesterday the markets finished flat simply because he finally sounded like he [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=168.36s)]
*  was open for a deal because there's been so much uncertainty ever since Liberation Day [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=173.36s)]
*  that people have been trying to figure out how big are the tariffs and how long are they [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=179.36s)]
*  going to last? Are they going to be just until we make a deal or will they be permanent [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=184.36s)]
*  because some on the president's team have said they're going to be permanent. But Scott [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=188.36s)]
*  Besant yesterday said essentially it's time for Monty Hall to make a deal. Watch this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=192.36s)]
*  I haven't seen anything from them. But Larry, I can tell you that there are 50, 60, maybe [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=199.36s)]
*  almost 70 countries now who have approached us. So it's going to be a busy April, May, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=205.36s)]
*  maybe into June. And Japan is a very important military ally. They're a very important [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=212.36s)]
*  economic ally. And the U.S. has a lot of history with them. So I would expect that Japan's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=219.36s)]
*  going to get priority just because they came forward very quickly. But it's going to be [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=227.36s)]
*  very busy. And if President Trump again gave himself maximum negotiating leverage and just [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=233.36s)]
*  when he achieved the maximum leverage, he's willing to start talking. Well, that's going [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=241.36s)]
*  to be interesting because Japan and Israel yesterday, Benjamin Netanyahu says, follow [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=246.36s)]
*  my lead. I'm down to zero. It's going to cost us $34 billion. Roughly, we'll take a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=251.36s)]
*  $34 billion hit if the 70% tariff level go into effect. But Japan, Vietnam, the EU, Cambodia, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=256.36s)]
*  Italy individually, the U.K., they're amongst the 70 countries that, best in set, have [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=265.36s)]
*  content access to a deal. And if you see the market responding like this on the rumors [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=270.36s)]
*  of a deal, and then yesterday they erroneously thought that Kevin Hassett told us that he's [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=275.36s)]
*  entertaining a 60-day pause, and the market went back like 500 points for about 15 minutes, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=281.36s)]
*  you could see how quickly everything would bounce back. And in the end, if people could [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=287.36s)]
*  see what Trump is doing now, maybe he's holding out for the best deal possible, perhaps, even [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=292.36s)]
*  though the New York Post says in the editorial section, start doing a deal, Mr. President. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=296.36s)]
*  He is staring them down Clint Eastwood style in order to get the maximum deal possible, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=300.36s)]
*  knowing that China is the main focus, but he's gotten the world's attention to reconfigure [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=306.36s)]
*  trade. Everybody's paying attention now. Nobody can ignore it. I was down in Florida over [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=311.36s)]
*  the weekend. I saw the president, and he is single-minded. He is in no mood to cave on [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=316.36s)]
*  anything he's doing right now. The problem is for all the people who are terrified to look at [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=321.36s)]
*  their 401Ks is they want to know, okay, so right now you can see the Dow futures are up 643. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=326.36s)]
*  How far is it going to go back up, and how long is it going to take? I was at a town event down [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=333.36s)]
*  in South Florida over the weekend, and I met this guy, and he's a retired banker. And I asked him [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=342.36s)]
*  about the tariffs, because at that event, everybody was talking about the tariffs, because [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=348.36s)]
*  everybody's on a fixed income for the most part, and they were talking about how they're impacted. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=352.36s)]
*  He said, you know, I'm on a pension, and the pension amount doesn't change, but I looked at my 401K, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=356.36s)]
*  and I am so underwater now. And he had the look of a guy. He was probably in his 80s. He's hoping [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=363.36s)]
*  that this all works, and it all comes back. And imagine if it does work, and it comes back. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=370.36s)]
*  Well, that would be great, but he's broke right now. In a huge way. Well, he probably has other [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=375.36s)]
*  money coming in, right? He's got pension money. Is he just relying on that? Okay. So, but Trump did [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=379.36s)]
*  say, we need to be strong, we need to be courageous, and we need to be patient. Just let him do his [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=383.36s)]
*  thing. And he said he's not considering the pause on tariffs, because remember Bill Ackman, you were [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=388.36s)]
*  talking about that yesterday, said he should consider that 90-day timeout. He said he's not going [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=393.36s)]
*  to do that. In fact, he's doubling down on China. China has these retaliatory tariffs, and he said [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=396.36s)]
*  if you don't get rid of those, then I'm going to tariff you another 50%. So that could be as much as [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=402.36s)]
*  104%. It's tariff Tuesday. You know what Apple said? We're going to move a lot of our production to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=407.36s)]
*  India. To India, right. That's exactly the hope. We've got to pull the American companies out of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=412.36s)]
*  that country. Well, they should move it to the United States. Much easier. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=416.36s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5PPPY3xe-A&t=426.36s)]
