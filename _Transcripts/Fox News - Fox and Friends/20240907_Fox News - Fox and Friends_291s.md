# US’s ‘plummeting’ birthrate is something we should all be concerned about: Expert
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM)
*  Advocates are sounding the alarm on America's baby bust as our country's birth rate hits a record low. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=0.0s)]
*  Last year, about 3.5 million children were born in the U.S. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=6.8s)]
*  That's the lowest number of birth since 1979. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=10.8s)]
*  Our next guest says the downward trend is, quote, this is from her op-ed in the Washington Examiner, it says, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=14.8s)]
*  A reflection of a society increasingly soaked in an anti-family ideology that views children as burdens rather than blessings. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=21.6s)]
*  A society that fails to value children is one that risks losing its sense of purpose, continuity, and responsibility. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  Joining me now is Sarah Gable-Seaford. She is the co-founder and president of Every Life. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=37.2s)]
*  Sarah, it's so great to have you on, and I thought your op-ed was so beautiful. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  A lot of people will blame the low birth rate on economics. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=47.2s)]
*  The economy is not doing well, but you're saying this is a much deeper cultural problem. Explain. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=51.6s)]
*  That's correct. Thank you, Rachel, for having me. It's an honor. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=58.0s)]
*  The birth rate today is at 1.6 babies per woman. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=62.0s)]
*  In order for us to have a healthy, sustaining future for our country, we need that replacement rate to be at minimum at 2.1. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=66.0s)]
*  It's really interesting that in the 1950s, the rate was at about 3.4. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=74.4s)]
*  So you can see that our birth rate is plummeting, and this is a problem that we should all be focusing on. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=79.2s)]
*  We need a country that is pro-life, pro-family, pro-freedom, and we don't have enough companies, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  we don't have enough people that are supporting these families, that are going above and beyond to say, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=93.2s)]
*  we know that in order for us to have a long, sustaining future, we have to have strong families. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=99.2s)]
*  At Every Life, we are doing that every single day. We are the first and only pro-life diaper company on the market today. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  Believe it or not, every other major diaper company today is supporting abortion, either vocally or financially. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  We decided to be the solution for parents that are passionate about shopping their pro-life values, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=116.8s)]
*  and knowing with a blessed assurance that they're partnering with a company that's giving back. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=123.2s)]
*  We've already had the opportunity of giving out over 1.7 million diapers to moms in urgent need of these essentials, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=127.6s)]
*  and this is how we start to see a culture shift to one that celebrates every miraculous life. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=135.2s)]
*  Yeah, well first of all, let me just say, as soon as I learned about your company, I switched Valentina over to your diapers immediately. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=140.0s)]
*  I had no idea those other companies were funding abortion groups, and you, of course, are doing the exact opposite, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=145.6s)]
*  but I'm also donating so many to moms in need. But I think it's really interesting, you laid out in this op-ed the economic case for having children, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=152.0s)]
*  but you also laid out something that it's really hard to give data on, which is just sort of the spiritual, fulfilling meaning in life reason to have children. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=162.8s)]
*  I think so many young people, they come to me, I'm sure they come to you, and they want life advice, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=173.6s)]
*  and I always tell them, yeah, follow your dreams, your career is great, but it will never fulfill you the way a family will, the way children will. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=178.8s)]
*  And I just think there's so many really dangerous messages that will ultimately change their lives for the rest of their lives. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=186.8s)]
*  Because if you don't get started falling in love and having a baby now, it's not going to happen, it's a lot harder to do much later. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=194.8s)]
*  You know? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=202.0s)]
*  That's correct, and it's wild to think that 44% of young people today are actually considering not having children at all. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=203.6s)]
*  23% are actually saying that due to their concerns to climate change, they don't want to bring a child into the world because they see it as a threat or a cancer to society. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=211.4s)]
*  And what we're saying at Every Life is that's not true. The best thing that you can ever embark upon is becoming a parent. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=220.6s)]
*  Children are a gift, they're a blessing, they're our hope, they're our future. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=226.8s)]
*  And so we need to start seeing more people shift this mindset of seeing children as a burden or something that's going to stop you from being able to pursue your dreams and your career [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=230.8s)]
*  and actually begin to see it as something that's going to make you a better person. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=240.8s)]
*  I know since being a mom, I'm stronger, I'm wiser, I'm more patient, I'm more loving, I'm more compassionate. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=244.0s)]
*  I'm actually better at my job because of my daughter. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=250.4s)]
*  And so I can't say enough good things about parenthood and life, and we're going to continue as a company to never stop singing our praises about being a parent [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  because it is the best job that one could ever embark upon. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=263.4s)]
*  Amen to that. Listen to Sarah, not that weirdo, Bill Gates, telling you not to have kids. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  The motto of your company, Make More Babies, Sarah. Every Life, we thank you so much for joining us. Fantastic message. We need it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=271.4s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=278.0s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=280.0s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lnuQlD2wBM&t=280.8s)]
