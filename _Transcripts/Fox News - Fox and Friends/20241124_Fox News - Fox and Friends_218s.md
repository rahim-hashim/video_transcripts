# 'ON CLOUD NINE': Ex-pipeliner hopeful Trump will make a ‘big difference’ for US energy
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8)
*  President-elect Trump vowing to make American energy dominance a day one priority, and it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=0.0s)]
*  seems he's already making good on that promise, as he's reportedly planning to revive the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=7.96s)]
*  Keystone pipeline, canceled under President Biden. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=12.76s)]
*  Our next guest was fired from his job on the Keystone pipeline when Biden canceled it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=16.84s)]
*  Bugsy Allen joins us now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=20.96s)]
*  Bugsy, it's good to see you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=22.64s)]
*  There's a lot of anticipation around this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=24.88s)]
*  Keystone pipeline was a big deal when it was canceled. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=26.44s)]
*  President Trump has made it clear he's bringing it back. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=29.68s)]
*  What difference will it make to U.S. energy to have the Keystone pipeline come back online? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=32.44s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=39.0s)]
*  Thanks for giving me a voice. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=40.88s)]
*  But yes, it will make a big difference as far as your energy costs, your food costs, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=42.84s)]
*  your gas that you put in your cars. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=49.6s)]
*  It is actually the primary, going to be the primary start of bringing everything, the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=52.08s)]
*  costs down for the American people that we have suffered so much in the last, this administration, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=57.12s)]
*  the four years that this administration has been in here, that they've canceled this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=64.12s)]
*  And not only the Keystone, they have canceled so many other ones. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=69.24s)]
*  Bigger lines are about the same size projects. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=75.12s)]
*  The thing is, the Biden administration is an artist at coming in and deflecting the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=81.12s)]
*  permits. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=88.12s)]
*  In other words, you've got to have permits to lay a pipeline. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=89.12s)]
*  Well, they come in there and they'll kick all the permits out so that an oil company [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=91.64s)]
*  or a gas company can't run a pipeline. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=97.52s)]
*  And it's hamstringed the American blue collar workers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  This right here is going to be a primary, good, very good start. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=106.2s)]
*  God bless Donald J. Trump. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=110.44s)]
*  He's going to come in and he's going to make this right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=112.12s)]
*  So Bugsy, you work on these pipelines. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=114.76s)]
*  I mean, you know plenty of people who work in these pipelines. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=116.88s)]
*  Is there sort of an anticipation amongst workers that, hey, we're back, there's going to be [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=119.88s)]
*  a lot of new projects, the permits are coming with, you've got Doug Burgum as a nominee [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=125.2s)]
*  for Interior Secretary. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=129.64s)]
*  He plays a big role there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=131.64s)]
*  What's the feeling among workers? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=133.04s)]
*  Oh my God, it's a breath of fresh air. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=136.0s)]
*  I mean, we're running on cloud nine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=138.96s)]
*  I'm going to tell you something, sir, in the last three, four years, it's just, I mean, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=141.32000000000002s)]
*  people have talked, it's been, it's been bad. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=147.4s)]
*  But now that Trump has got in office, God bless him. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=150.12s)]
*  And I have prayed for this man to get in office because it is give us a breath of fresh air. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=153.84s)]
*  The American people is going to see the difference between day and night, what energy will do [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=160.56s)]
*  for a country and what no energy will do. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=167.72s)]
*  And I hope and I prayed that the people will have their eyes enlightened and see that electric [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=171.68s)]
*  is not just all that great. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=178.44s)]
*  It's good, but oil and gas is the main driver of any country. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=181.44s)]
*  Trump is fixing to show this in the next four years. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=187.56s)]
*  Well, Bugsy, we appreciate your perspective because you're right on the front lines. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=191.84s)]
*  You see what's happening and you know what it means for people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  Thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=200.24s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=202.24s)]
*  And thank you for giving me a voice and God bless America. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  You bet. Our pleasure indeed. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjw3mXt3w8&t=206.28s)]
