**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8)
*  Meanwhile Donald Trump holding an hour-long press conference ahead of his trip to Montana tonight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=0.0s)]
*  And while Kamala Harris travels to battleground, Arizona, the former president explains why he is hitting a red state instead [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=4.8s)]
*  I'm going out. Actually. I'm going out to certain places to help certain senators get elected not even for me [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=13.36s)]
*  I'm trying to help when I go out to Wyoming or when I go out to Montana or I'm going to different places [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=19.3s)]
*  to help people and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=24.88s)]
*  I don't have to go there because I'm leading those states as you know by thirty five forty fifty points [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=26.919999999999998s)]
*  I'm leading by record numbers. I'm going because I want to help senators and congressmen get elected [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=32.2s)]
*  And he wants to be in this case John Tester and put Tim Sheehy in the Senate [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  Joining us right now is Trump surrogate Stephen Miller who certainly will be in the White House doing something important if Donald Trump wins [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=44.32s)]
*  So what was your do you believe that that press conference? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=50.92s)]
*  Forced Kamala Harris to even take a question yesterday [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=54.68s)]
*  Which was are you gonna debate Donald Trump and then she said no, I'm gonna skip two out of the three debates [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=62.28s)]
*  Look, you can't be the president if you can't hold a press conference [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=68.88s)]
*  Donald Trump put on a masterclass yesterday touching on every single issue every single policy question every part and region of the world [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=74.68s)]
*  For an hour with reporters who mostly are not on our team [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=82.19999999999999s)]
*  Mostly are part of the left mostly are part of the Democrat establishment and he did it joyfully and happily for an hour [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris cannot do a press conference for five minutes ten minutes fifteen minutes, let alone an hour ask yourself America [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=93.24s)]
*  How can you lead America if you can't even stand at a podium for even ten minutes and answer? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=101.32s)]
*  Questions from reporters on behalf of the American people so Senator Mark Kelly was gonna be the we thought was going to be the running mate [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=108.52s)]
*  He's not gonna be the running mate [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=115.36s)]
*  But they're gonna go to Arizona where the number one issue or number two issue in most people's polls is [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=117.08s)]
*  Legal immigration when asked the people of Arizona. What's important to you? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  34% said border security 32% inflation 22% said abortion [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=126.32s)]
*  threats to democracy 20% said the economy and jobs having said that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=131.72s)]
*  Kamala Harris has portrayed herself now went from I'm not the borders are to I'm tough on the border and I prosecute [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=136.55999999999997s)]
*  People on the border. How do you fight that? I? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=143.0s)]
*  Mean she is a liar. This is the greatest lie ever told [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=147.76s)]
*  Brian not only do we have the tape that you've played that we've all seen of Joe Biden appointing her as borders are [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=152.48s)]
*  Where she'd been working for the last three and a half years in the West Wing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  She's co-running the country with Joe Biden right now and what has happened on her watch as vice president and borders are an [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=164.76s)]
*  all-time record of illegal immigration in 2021 then surpassed that in 2022 then surpassed that in 2023 [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=172.68s)]
*  Then we'll get a new record in 2024. We've seen the killings. We've seen the slayings [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=179.32s)]
*  We've seen the tragic rapes of women and children the record deaths from drugs [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=184.08s)]
*  We have seen terrorists just a new report from the House Judiciary Committee [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=188.56s)]
*  99 terrorists were in Border Patrol custody in custody Brian and what did Harris and Biden do they ordered them released and now they're living in our cities [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  This issue alone. Donald Trump will be able to prosecute to victory in November [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=201.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's incredible. It's almost if she just does not want to engage in any of these issues and the press is not pushing it [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=206.2s)]
*  Hopefully that changes by naming Tim waltz [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=213.32s)]
*  She's saying I'm gonna go left and I'm gonna be happy to be there Stephen Miller [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  Thanks so much left of left right and we'll see what happens [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYIC89r7ed8&t=219.24s)]
