# GOP rep blasts 'losing' Harris campaign: 'You're hearing a failing strategy'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM)
*  All right, well our next guest will be attending today's rally, New York's GOP Congresswoman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=0.0s)]
*  and Women for Trump co-chair Elise Stefanik joins us now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=4.72s)]
*  Welcome, Elise. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=9.16s)]
*  Excited to be here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=10.16s)]
*  It's a big day. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=11.16s)]
*  Well, it is a big day. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=12.16s)]
*  These crowds are amazing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=13.64s)]
*  The love outside. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=14.64s)]
*  Everybody who goes to Trump rallies say they feel a lot of love. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=15.64s)]
*  I want to talk about a message yesterday from Michelle Obama. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=17.52s)]
*  This is the message she's sending to men. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=22.68s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=25.28s)]
*  Do not hand our fates over to the likes of Trump who knows nothing about us, who has [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=27.040000000000003s)]
*  shown deep contempt for us. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=32.96s)]
*  Because a vote for him is a vote against us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=37.52s)]
*  Against our health. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=42.8s)]
*  Against our worth. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=45.08s)]
*  To think that the men that we love could be either unaware or indifferent to our plight [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=46.08s)]
*  is simply heartbreaking. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=55.4s)]
*  So fellas, before you cast your votes, ask yourselves what side of history do you want [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=57.56s)]
*  to be on? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=65.6s)]
*  So she's crying, she's making an appeal for the mail vote that they're clearly losing [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=67.16s)]
*  out to Donald Trump on. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  Elise, what struck me the most about her remarks was when she, this was basically, if you watch [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=73.64s)]
*  the whole speech everybody, it's basically an abortion speech. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=78.64s)]
*  It's an abortion speech. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=81.4s)]
*  It's a dystopian vision of American and women's health. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=82.48s)]
*  I told Pete earlier and Will, I didn't even want to have a baby after I listened to what [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=86.64s)]
*  she described as, you know, what it's like to have a baby and that we're all going to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=90.8s)]
*  die from it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=94.6s)]
*  I thought it was appalling actually. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=95.88s)]
*  And I'd like to know what you think of the remarks that she made and if you think this [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=98.84s)]
*  appeal will work. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=102.4s)]
*  No, this is a losing campaign. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=103.4s)]
*  You're hearing a failing strategy from Kamala Harris. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=105.6s)]
*  President Trump's campaign has never had more energy and support. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=109.36s)]
*  You can see that with the people who have been out there since last night waiting for [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=111.84s)]
*  Madison Square Garden. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=115.24s)]
*  I've been in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia campaigning for President [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=116.64s)]
*  Trump and the energy and enthusiasm is higher than it was even before 2016. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=120.44s)]
*  And we already see with early vote numbers, Republicans are flooding the polls. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=125.12s)]
*  They are flooding the polls. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=128.64s)]
*  In our first day of early voting in New York State, we have historic turnout in Republican [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=129.76s)]
*  areas with Republican voters. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=134.18s)]
*  That was yesterday. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=135.56s)]
*  And what's interesting is Kamala Harris is underperforming Donald Trump in every single [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=137.04s)]
*  swing district across the country. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=140.64s)]
*  Look here in New York. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=142.6s)]
*  She will be the lowest, get the lowest amount of support from any Democrat candidate for [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=143.6s)]
*  president since the 1980s. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=147.84s)]
*  So President Trump's America First movement, it appeals to all Americans. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=150.04s)]
*  That's why you're seeing historic support among Hispanic Americans, African Americans, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=153.32s)]
*  working class, Jewish and I believe women voters. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=157.28s)]
*  He has a tremendous record when it comes to women's opportunity, whether it's economic [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=160.08s)]
*  opportunity, the highest number of women in the workforce ever when he was president [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=164.72s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=167.96s)]
*  Congresswoman, that story you just told us as it's playing out in New York is, as you [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=168.96s)]
*  mentioned as well, playing out in other states. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=173.16s)]
*  A lot of registration gains for Republicans. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=174.72s)]
*  Early voting also way bigger than in the past for Republicans. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=179.68s)]
*  I think the big question is, is that new or low propensity voters or is that cannibalizing [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=182.28s)]
*  Republicans past historic success on election day? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=188.84s)]
*  Well that's what the Trump campaign is very focused on. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=192.24s)]
*  They are focused on turning out low propensity voters. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=194.36s)]
*  Yesterday I knocked on doors in Bucks County with the Trump Force 47 captain. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=196.88000000000002s)]
*  Those are the local grassroots captains who are focused on turning out those low propensity [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=201.84s)]
*  voters and the data that the Trump campaign is seeing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  And again, we cannot be complacent. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=208.96s)]
*  We have to turn out every vote and sprint through the tape on election day is focusing [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=210.5s)]
*  on turning out those low propensity voters. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  The problem that the Democrats have is they're not turning out their voters. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=216.32000000000002s)]
*  has not energized Democrats who previously have turned out to vote for Joe Biden. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=220.04s)]
*  And you see that in the swing districts. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=225.68s)]
*  You see it in the swing states. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=227.1s)]
*  So all of this as you see Republican Senate candidate surge and House Republicans running [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=228.36s)]
*  on the same ticket as Donald Trump. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=233.04s)]
*  Donald Trump turns out voters more effectively than any other candidate in America of either [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=234.6s)]
*  party. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=239.36s)]
*  Well, he's about to turn them out, turn them out right here in New York City. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=240.36s)]
*  You're going to be on stage, right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=243.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  There at the event. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  It's a real honor. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  President has talked about for years with everyone. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=248.16s)]
*  This is iconic not only for President Trump, but for the entire Trump family. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=251.0s)]
*  We are so excited. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=254.42s)]
*  And President Trump has had a vision for growing the Republican Party in New York. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  And as you all remember, it was New York that flipped those five seats. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=259.08s)]
*  He is committed to continue growing this movement. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=262.41999999999996s)]
*  And it's America first. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=265.32s)]
*  You have people who are coming all across the country. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=266.5s)]
*  Kamala Harris could never fill Madison Square Garden. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  This sold out in three hours when President Trump announced this. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=271.18s)]
*  So it will be an exciting historic evening. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=273.78s)]
*  And I'm honored to be there for it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=276.06s)]
*  Thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9lUI6K-vM&t=277.8s)]
