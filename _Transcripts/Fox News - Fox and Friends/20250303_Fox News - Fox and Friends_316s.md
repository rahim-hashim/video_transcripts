# Democrat denigrates JD Vance's military service with 'mind-blowing' insult
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk)
*  I saw the meeting as a despicable display of bullying by the president of the United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=0.0s)]
*  States and the vice president of the United States. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=4.72s)]
*  I think he was cornered and he was bullied in the Oval Office. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  And Margaret, that just makes us look weak. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=11.88s)]
*  Either it was an ambush setup or they just got so hot-headed, the president and the vice [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=13.56s)]
*  president, that what happened happened. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=19.84s)]
*  You know, it's the chaos of this presidency. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=22.36s)]
*  So it is absolutely shameful what is happening right now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=24.96s)]
*  The White House has become an arm of the Kremlin. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=27.52s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy, you can't even take him seriously. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=32.2s)]
*  He just thinks he's going to raise money by going after Trump. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=34.6s)]
*  Democrats bringing back their old tactics after President Trump and Vice President Vance's [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=37.76s)]
*  Oval Office clash with the Ukrainian president on Friday. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=41.36s)]
*  Zelensky, here to discuss it, Fox News contributor Joey Jones. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  And Joey, we can talk about the war, that's another thing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=48.2s)]
*  But the attack on the president, the White House, on JD Vance is something else that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=51.0s)]
*  emerged after we spoke. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=55.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's really puzzling to me. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=56.6s)]
*  I guess the intellectual honesty has kind of left Congress at this point and the divisiveness [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=58.32s)]
*  of bipartisanship. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=62.84s)]
*  You know, you're just trying so hard to grab on to money or support from whatever organization, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=63.84s)]
*  ActBlue or MoveOn.org. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=69.4s)]
*  You're just trying to say something sensational to go viral. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  There's no way that a reasonable, responsible person who's been elected to represent this [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  country thinks that going on national television and calling our vice president a coward, our [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=78.08s)]
*  president a puppet of Putin, is helpful for our country. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=82.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=86.12s)]
*  Here is a former Marine, Seth Moulton, who I thought had a pathway to being the Federman [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=86.62s)]
*  on the right after he was blitzed for saying that men should not play in women's sports. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=92.76s)]
*  But he didn't. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=98.58000000000001s)]
*  He went right back left. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=99.58000000000001s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=100.58000000000001s)]
*  The president of the United States is a coward who is Vladimir Putin's puppet. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  The vice president of the United States is a pogu and a coward who is Donald Trump's puppet. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=108.30000000000001s)]
*  And so what we just witnessed was a meeting in the Oval Office between two cowardly puppets [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=115.55999999999999s)]
*  and a hero. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  Yes, pretty much. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=125.36s)]
*  You know, you said former Marine, and usually as a Marine we say, hey, listen, we're not [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=126.36s)]
*  former Marines. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=129.56s)]
*  Once a Marine, always a Marine. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=130.56s)]
*  We formerly active duty. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=131.56s)]
*  And it's a point of pride for us. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=133.0s)]
*  We carry that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  It's on my collar every time I come on this network. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  What bothers me so much about the way Seth Moulton handled this, number one, pogu is a [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=138.2s)]
*  very intentional word. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=140.92s)]
*  It means person other than grunt. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  So what Seth Moulton is saying, he said in 2014 actually, just about a year ago, he said [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  that JD Vance in describing him, he said that he was a combat Marine and he goes, oh, I [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  mean actually a combat cameraman. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  He said he's a Marine Corps veteran. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  He says, oh, I mean combat cameraman or a combat journalist. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=159.08s)]
*  And so what he's trying to do is trying to denigrate JD Vance's service. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=162.08s)]
*  But sit there and call him a pogu, person other than grunt. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=165.0s)]
*  Maybe he doesn't understand this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=168.36s)]
*  Seth Moulton, I'm a pogu. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=169.84s)]
*  I'm a person other than grunt. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=170.84s)]
*  I wasn't infantry. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=171.84s)]
*  I hope that my service doesn't come across as cowardly to you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=172.84s)]
*  I hope that you respect my service. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=176.24s)]
*  You served with Brian Mast. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=178.6s)]
*  He's a pogu. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=179.8s)]
*  He wasn't a grunt. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=180.8s)]
*  He lost his legs. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=181.8s)]
*  I watched Brian Mast recover with his hands sewn to his stomach. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=182.8s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=185.72s)]
*  It's a very intentional word. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=186.72s)]
*  Up until World War II, it was used to describe homosexuals. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=187.72s)]
*  So maybe he's a historian and he's trying to attack him in that way. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=195.76s)]
*  But Seth Moulton needs to understand that every female Marine that served in combat, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=196.76s)]
*  or killed in combat prior to 2012 was a pogu. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=201.12s)]
*  They were a person other than a grunt. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=204.08s)]
*  And it just bothers me that we have a Marine Corps officer in Congress, regardless of what [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=207.04s)]
*  his policy positions are, that doesn't have the honor, the courage, the commitment, the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=210.36s)]
*  integrity to sit there and take issue with JD Vance's policy position, take issue with [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=215.04s)]
*  the outcome that may come from the policies that he and President Trump make. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  You can't find an intellectual argument to tell the American people why they're wrong. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  If you have to call them stupid names like Pogue and Coward, I would never call Seth [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=228.08s)]
*  Moulton a coward because it takes absolute courage or complete stupidity to go on live [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=231.36s)]
*  TV as a Marine Corps officer and call another enlisted Marine who's risen to vice president [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  of Pogue and a coward. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  That takes some sort of absolute stupidity or courage. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  But I wouldn't call him a coward. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  And to call JD Vance a coward and to try to denigrate his service that way, it just really [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  it blows my mind. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=254.72000000000003s)]
*  It's pretty amazing when you call the president a coward, his shot got up and what he did [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=256.36s)]
*  and every day that he got up after a second attempt, he still wanted the job. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=259.36s)]
*  He stared down prison sentence for a year and a half. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=263.56s)]
*  And the other thing is, did he ever call out Joe Biden for scripting the biggest disaster [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=267.32s)]
*  in American history? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=272.88s)]
*  You know, I'd love to know how much Seth Moulton cares about those 13 mostly Marines that were [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=273.88s)]
*  killed at Abbey Gate. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=277.42s)]
*  I would imagine it's not a topic he broaches very often. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=278.42s)]
*  And that is borderline cowardice, if you ask me. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=281.4s)]
*  But he got to get some booked on CNN again. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=284.56s)]
*  So maybe it's a success. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=286.08s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=287.08s)]
*  It takes anything but a coward to sit in that White House and know the blowback that's going [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=288.08s)]
*  to come, but to make a call and to say specific words like JD Vance and President Trump did [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=292.96s)]
*  that put us in this situation now because they believe there's a better outcome for [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=298.6s)]
*  them. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=301.76s)]
*  Even if you don't agree with it, it's not cowardice. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=302.76s)]
*  Great points, Joe. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=304.08s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=305.08s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=306.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2yQ0wnEggk&t=314.56s)]
