# Biden commutes nearly 1,500 sentences, pardons 39
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFC9-q-Gn3I)
*  Fox News alert right now, President Biden granting the largest single day act of clemency in modern history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFC9-q-Gn3I&t=0.0s)]
*  Brooke Singman joins us with this breaking news. Brooke. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFC9-q-Gn3I&t=5.76s)]
*  Good morning, Brian. That's right. So the White House announcing this news overnight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFC9-q-Gn3I&t=9.28s)]
*  President Biden commuting the sentence of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on house arrest during the pandemic. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFC9-q-Gn3I&t=12.64s)]
*  He's also pardoning at least 39 more people, all of whom have been convicted of nonviolent crimes. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFC9-q-Gn3I&t=20.32s)]
*  Now, the previous single day record for clemency was held by Biden's old boss, former President Barack Obama. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFC9-q-Gn3I&t=26.479999999999997s)]
*  But today's action is five times larger than that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFC9-q-Gn3I&t=31.84s)]
*  We had heard reports last week that the Biden administration was considering issuing preemptive pardons for a handful of people like Liz Shaney, Anthony Fauci and Adam Schiff out of fear that the incoming Trump administration could target them. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFC9-q-Gn3I&t=35.2s)]
*  But it appears none of those three names are part of this list. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFC9-q-Gn3I&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  This also follows the president's controversial decision to pardon his son, Hunter, who faced sentencing this month for felony tax and gun convictions. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFC9-q-Gn3I&t=52.08s)]
*  White House lawyers say those pardoned this morning had all been convicted of nonviolent crimes such as drug offenses and say they have since turned their lives around. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFC9-q-Gn3I&t=60.8s)]
*  Lawrence. We'll be looking out for the rest of the list. Thanks, Brooke. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFC9-q-Gn3I&t=69.44s)]
*  you [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFC9-q-Gn3I&t=82.0s)]
