# Tom Homan reveals which blue city is first for mass deportations
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg)
*  He's been the only Democrat that's willing to work with this administration as a mayor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=0.0s)]
*  Chicago resisting LA resisting and it looks like Tom Holman [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Has accepted the invitation from Mayor Adams to have a meeting today to talk about what they're gonna do [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=10.3s)]
*  Once he takes off right we're not asking for a lot. No, we're asking for access to criminals [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=17.18s)]
*  That's right. The detainers honored give give ice a chance by the way. I thought it was a great [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=22.22s)]
*  Robert Holden a Democrat from Queens said if you want to show that mayor Adams talk is great [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=28.44s)]
*  But if you want to show that you're sincere give [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=33.92s)]
*  Put set up the ice office at Rikers again because they closed it down because they don't want to let he's also considering [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=37.96s)]
*  Eric Adams is also considering getting rid of the sanctuary city status. That's right [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=44.08s)]
*  But so so Tom Holman pictured right there is gonna be meeting with the mayor of New York. It's interesting on Monday night [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=47.68s)]
*  Tom Holman was at an event and he revealed we know that the deportation plan, you know on a wide scale [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=54.04s)]
*  You know, you know what American City they're gonna start in they're gonna start in Chicago [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=61.02s)]
*  He was a guest Monday night at a holiday party for law and order pack. This is one of the quotes according to CBS in Chicago [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=65.68s)]
*  Tom Holman said Chicago's in trouble because your mayor sucks and your governor sucks [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=73.12s)]
*  and so he says it's gonna start in Chicago right after the inauguration and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=77.56s)]
*  Holman asked the mayor mayor Johnson and governor Pritzker to come to the table and help with the biggest deportation in history [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=83.24s)]
*  And here's the other quote. He said if your mayor doesn't want to help he can step aside [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  There's Johnson right there [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  But if he impedes us Tom Holman said if he knowingly harbors or conceals any illegal alien, I will [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=95.08s)]
*  Prosecute him. So that's new now [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  Tom Holman is suggesting if these people in the sanctuary city do [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=105.84s)]
*  Impede the federal government he's gonna press charges. Well, you can't harbor felons. No, you can't [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=110.22s)]
*  There's already a federal statute and and that's all they're saying right now [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=117.02s)]
*  Is that when we come to pick them up, they're already in custody [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=121.58s)]
*  Or they're already in a certain community. The residents are upset. Just let us just get out of the way [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=125.94s)]
*  proof and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=133.29999999999998s)]
*  From the residents themselves listen to them speaking out against their mayor watch [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=134.5s)]
*  Mayor Brandon Johnson you took an oath to uphold the Constitution [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=140.22s)]
*  Or when you took an oath was only intended to fight for the 10th and 14th amendments regarding illegal aliens [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=143.78s)]
*  We don't want illegals in our community [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=149.18s)]
*  We don't want migrants terrorizing our own people and have y'all sit up here and say we have to accept [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=151.7s)]
*  70 million dollars being given to them when you got black people who are already [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=158.9s)]
*  Struggling and need help. It is a disgrace [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=163.94s)]
*  All people and that by the way we can we go to play 12 of these [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=166.82s)]
*  So the people agree with Tom [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=171.26s)]
*  Well, and you could see in that wide shot you could see that some people were wearing you could see red shirts [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=173.38s)]
*  You know what the shred shirt said? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=179.54s)]
*  Chicago flips red so essentially he's getting in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=182.78s)]
*  Let me just finish this up. So essentially those people who are showing up are suggesting. Okay, you don't listen to me. Just remember [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=186.7s)]
*  The politics have [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=195.12s)]
*  Consequences and we could flip this down red, which it would be rare. I'm so glad this is their message [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=197.16s)]
*  Finally because we you've been to Chicago how many times I mean Giano Caldwell's brother was killed there and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=202.44s)]
*  It's very dangerous already. The money needs to go to the residents. It doesn't need to go to the illegals [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=208.76s)]
*  Well, Ainsley and when I was there a few months ago, they're showing this net we're showing this now [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=213.84s)]
*  But we covered this lead and up to the election [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=219.08s)]
*  They have shut down schools of kids and in the community they said they didn't have any money for it and then they [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=221.46s)]
*  Reopened them to shut them down. Well, they shut them down because [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=227.54000000000002s)]
*  They said we don't have any money to fund this school or this community center [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=232.62s)]
*  But then they reopened them found the money magically for the legal steer [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=236.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, y'all remember when I was in there as well. I was outside of one of the holding facility [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=241.02s)]
*  There's drug bags all outside of the place where they clearly have some type of illegal substance there and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=245.3s)]
*  The residents have been crying out for help for a long time and the mayor is still giving a back answer [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=252.5s)]
*  Why is the mayor's not listening to the people? But you know, what's interesting is that the people he thinks he's representing? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=257.7s)]
*  He is he doesn't understand he's going by an old playbook [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=265.02s)]
*  He thinks that if I go to the bat for inner-city America or for minorities in my city [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=268.54s)]
*  I'm gonna make the hard decision against the law enforcement [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=274.38s)]
*  But law enforcement and his people actually agree. He's the impediment [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=277.9s)]
*  So is the Denver mayor the impediment? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=283.21999999999997s)]
*  Denver has fallen apart crushing on its own weight per capita more illegals more immigrants than even New York City and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=285.58s)]
*  All they care all this mayor cares about I'm gonna fight for my people [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=292.9s)]
*  Do you understand that your people are asking you to get out of the way and he once agreed? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=296.58s)]
*  Yeah, he told us in an interview that they're at their breaking point [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=300.86s)]
*  Magically when Donald Trump is elected then he turns back to the same old thing [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=305.02s)]
*  So you can't just resist because it's Trump you got to do what your people are asking you to do [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=309.62s)]
*  And the Chicago people are simply saying look you're spending too much money on the migrants [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=315.65999999999997s)]
*  And you know what? You know what? I think the people of Chicago would like a Department of Government efficiency [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=320.86s)]
*  How long is they need a doge in Chicago? How long he's in office? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=325.9s)]
*  Well, you just got a year ago. It's like a year two and a half years. I would say [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=329.62s)]
*  Also, they are in the right right in Chicago [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=334.98s)]
*  They continue to elect these individuals that and that's what common sense and that's why Tom Homan is starting in Chicago [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=339.18s)]
*  The crazy thing is he was second and they had the runoff and he has up winning [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=346.54s)]
*  But Chicago Chicago reminds me of New York remember it was they were great cities great cities. I still love New York [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=349.94s)]
*  I love New York, but it's different. I [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=357.18s)]
*  Was beautiful Chicago was a clean mini, New York [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=360.97999999999996s)]

*  Outside our old apartment in Chicago just across nice area. Yes [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=378.21999999999997s)]

*  Avenue a lot of yeah, we're closing down exactly and an innocent person was hit so that that's a jarring reality for a lot of people [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdNXXyRe1Kg&t=385.68s)]
