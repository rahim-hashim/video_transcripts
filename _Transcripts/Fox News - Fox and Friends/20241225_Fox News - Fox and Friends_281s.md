# How Hanukkah starting on Christmas can bring interfaith families closer
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0)
*  For the first time in almost 20 years, Hanukkah and Christmas will be celebrated on the very [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=0.0s)]
*  same day, bringing interfaith families together while highlighting America's religious heritage. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=5.16s)]
*  So what's it going to be, huh? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=10.72s)]
*  You want your menorah or a candy cane? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=14.16s)]
*  Christmas or Hanukkah? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=16.92s)]
*  Uh, I'm not. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=18.92s)]
*  Don't worry about it, buddy, because in this house, you don't have to choose. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=21.34s)]
*  Allow me to introduce you to a little something that I like to call... [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=24.36s)]
*  Christmas. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=28.36s)]
*  Christmas. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=30.36s)]
*  That's right, it's a new holiday, Ryan, and it's sweeping the nation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=32.36s)]
*  Well, as founding father, President John Adams once said, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=34.36s)]
*  the Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=38.36s)]
*  It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=42.36s)]
*  Years later, Dwight Eisenhower echoed, quote, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=46.36s)]
*  Our form of government makes no sense unless founded in a deeply felt religious faith, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=49.36s)]
*  with Reagan later writing, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=53.36s)]
*  If we ever forget that we are one nation under God, then we will be a nation gone under. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=57.36s)]
*  Joining us now with their joint message, Rabbi Aria Lightstone and Father Gerald Murray. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=63.36s)]
*  Good morning to you both. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=68.36s)]
*  Rabbi, you'll be having a little bit of fun with that movie clip, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=70.36s)]
*  The fact that Hanukkah starts on December 25th really is a wonderful way [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=73.36s)]
*  to highlight the unity between Christians and Jews. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=78.36s)]
*  So with that in mind, what should we be thinking about this holiday season? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=81.36s)]
*  Well, I think the weather report that we just heard beforehand [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=86.36s)]
*  tells us that this is the darkest and coldest time of the year. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=89.36s)]
*  And when you look at the excitement about Christmas and Hanukkah, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=93.36s)]
*  the number one adjective that plays in my mind is warmth. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=96.36s)]
*  And in the darkest and perhaps coldest time, let's make it lighter, let's make it warmer. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=100.36s)]
*  And I think that is what unites all of us in America who believe so deeply [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=105.36s)]
*  in the Judeo-Christian values of which this country was founded upon. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=109.36s)]
*  Father Murray, weigh in here. What is your message for us this morning? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=112.36s)]
*  Yeah, the message is that faith in God is strong in our country. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=115.36s)]
*  And the fact that our Jewish brethren also celebrating a great feast on Christmas Day [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=119.36s)]
*  is a sign of God's providence that this is a country in which we have freedom to worship God. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=124.36s)]
*  We have a great dose of respect for each other's religions. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=129.36s)]
*  And we love that common heritage, that Judeo-Christian heritage, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=132.36s)]
*  which is the foundation of our nation. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=135.36s)]
*  As those presidential quotes said, if we don't have faith in God, our nation has no future. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=137.36s)]
*  Rabbi, it has been a difficult year for the Jewish people for obvious reasons. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=143.36s)]
*  What is the meaning of Hanukkah in light of that? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=149.36s)]
*  I think there are two fundamental messages that I want people to know about Hanukkah. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=152.36s)]
*  One is that you are not a bystander to history. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=157.36s)]
*  The Maccabees, who are the heroes of the Hanukkah story, saw an injustice. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=160.36s)]
*  They rose up to fight against the tyranny. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=165.36s)]
*  They rose up to fight against those who were anti-religion and anti-God. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=168.36s)]
*  And they were able to restore freedom and integrity for their religious freedom in the land of Israel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=172.36s)]
*  And the second is when you reach out as somebody looking to fight for that which is right, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=180.36s)]
*  God will meet you halfway. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=186.36s)]
*  It was the miracle of the oil that was only supposed to last one day that lasted eight, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=188.36s)]
*  where God sends his divine hand and says, you did the right thing, let me partner with you. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=192.36s)]
*  And that's a story to all people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=198.36s)]
*  We are here to partner with God and his mission to perfect the world. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=200.36s)]
*  Yeah, we certainly are. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=204.36s)]
*  Father, we just were talking about when we finished our holiday gift shopping, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=205.36s)]
*  and some people aren't even done yet. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=209.36s)]
*  And with that in mind, there's so much gift giving and material pressure put on people at this time of year. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=211.36s)]
*  It can be pretty easy to forget about the main message of Christmas. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=218.36s)]
*  So how do you keep the main thing, Jesus Christ, at the center of this season? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=223.36s)]
*  Yeah, well, we remind ourselves that the greatest gift is not something under the tree, but it's Jesus Christ. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=228.36s)]
*  And the gift that God gives to us and his Son, who is the light of the world, is meant to teach us a lesson. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=234.36s)]
*  Materialism is a dead end. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=240.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's good to share gifts. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=242.36s)]
*  It's good to share love in that way. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=244.36s)]
*  But what really counts is what's in our heart. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=246.36s)]
*  And do we manifest that in the way we treat each other? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=248.36s)]
*  So Christmas is a time to say, good Lord, teach me to love other people the way you love us all in Christ. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=250.36s)]
*  And hopefully we can carry that in our hearts the whole year through. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=257.36s)]
*  Wonderful messages from both of you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=262.36s)]
*  Rabbi Lightstone, Father Murray, thank you both so much for joining us today. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hgbgzRnCu0&t=264.36s)]
