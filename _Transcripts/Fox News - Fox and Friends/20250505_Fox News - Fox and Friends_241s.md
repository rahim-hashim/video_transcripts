# NEW: Trump to reopen Alcatraz for 'most ruthless and violent offenders'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0)
*  Well, President Trump says he wants to reopen the notorious Alcatraz prison off the coast [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=0.0s)]
*  of California to house America's worst of the worst. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=6.8s)]
*  Madeline Rivera is live in Washington with the details. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=10.56s)]
*  Good morning, Maddie. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=12.6s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=13.6s)]
*  The president says he wants to reopen Alcatraz because he's frustrated with judges who have [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=14.6s)]
*  placed roadblocks on parts of his agenda, especially on immigration. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=19.56s)]
*  The president's saying on Truth Social for too long, America has been plagued by vicious, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=23.64s)]
*  violent and repeat criminal offenders, the dregs of society who will never contribute [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=28.64s)]
*  anything other than misery and suffering. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=33.72s)]
*  That is why today I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=36.44s)]
*  Justice, FBI and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt Alcatraz [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=40.32s)]
*  to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  The president was press about this when he got back to the White House last night. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=50.96s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=54.6s)]
*  Just an idea I've had, and I guess because the judges, so many of these radicalized judges, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=56.56s)]
*  they want to have trials for every single, think of it, every single person that's in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=62.72s)]
*  our country illegally, they came in illegally, that would mean millions of trials. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=67.36s)]
*  And it's just so ridiculous what's happening. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=72.2s)]
*  And it's long been a symbol, Alcatraz. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  It's a symbol of law and order. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=78.48s)]
*  Alcatraz was used as a maximum security federal prison for nearly 30 years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=82.0s)]
*  It housed several well-known criminals, including Al Capone and George Machine Gun Kelly. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  The prison was closed in 1963 because it became too expensive to operate. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=90.96s)]
*  Now it's a popular tourist destination with more than one million visitors per year. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=96.0s)]
*  Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calls the president's proposal not a serious one. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  But is it even possible for Alcatraz to lose its designation as a historical landmark? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  One of the National Park Service's website, a property's historical designation can be [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  considered for withdrawal at the request of the owner or the Interior Secretary, provided [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  some criteria are met. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  Lawrence Ainsley and Brian. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=120.96s)]
*  Thank you so much, Maddie. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=123.64s)]
*  Thanks, Maddie. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=124.64s)]
*  He was talking about prices going down. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=125.64s)]
*  He said, grocery prices are down, prices are down for oil, energy prices are down. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=127.28s)]
*  For gas prices, gasoline is a thousand times more important than a stroller because Kristen [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  Welker said, well, stroller prices are down. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=135.72s)]
*  He's basically saying, are you crazy? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=138.6s)]
*  You're focused on that and not the big picture of prices going down elsewhere. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  I kind of feel that way about him talking about reopening Alcatraz. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  Obviously, you can't reopen it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  There's some museum and all that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  But I do think he's highlighting the bigger picture, which is we've got criminals roaming [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  the street, Americans and non-Americans. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=154.88s)]
*  When he said that he was considering deporting or housing Americans, he wanted the Department [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=158.27999999999997s)]
*  of Justice to look at it, to see if we can send them to Venezuela. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=164.68s)]
*  They complained about that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=168.44s)]
*  And now he's saying that he wants to reopen a prison or potentially build a new prison. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=170.24s)]
*  And they don't like that as well. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=174.72s)]
*  But I think it's the spirit of the conversation. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=175.72s)]
*  It's just so funny because San Francisco doesn't want to arrest anyone and that's when they'll [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=178.32s)]
*  rebuild Alcatraz. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  But hey, let's find out. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Let's get a price on it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=183.58s)]
*  It's a perfect place. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=184.58s)]
*  You try to escape. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=186.12s)]
*  We watched the movie. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=187.12s)]
*  You get eaten by sharks. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=188.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=189.12s)]
*  So let's see how much it costs to spackle it up. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=190.12s)]
*  Maybe get a playground in there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=193.0s)]
*  We'll see what goes on. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=195.36s)]
*  You know, a little shuttle so families can go visit the worst of the worst. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=196.36s)]
*  And his message, his point was back then we used to lock up the most dangerous criminals. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=200.32s)]
*  We kept them away from everybody without hesitation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=204.72s)]
*  And it's really been over the last just few decades, I would say, maybe just the last [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=208.0s)]
*  decade where you have all these Democrats that seem to be more concerned with the criminal [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=211.8s)]
*  than the victim. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=217.08s)]
*  So they want to reimagine our criminal justice system and the criminals start running our [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=218.08s)]
*  streets. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=222.56s)]
*  They demonize the police. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=223.56s)]
*  We have record low law enforcement and now they're making a comeback. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=224.56s)]
*  And now we've got all these criminals that we've got to pick up off the street. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SOhbRXWj0&t=228.24s)]
