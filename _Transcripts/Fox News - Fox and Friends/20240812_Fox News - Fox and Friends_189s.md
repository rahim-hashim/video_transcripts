**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s)
*  Former President Trump is set to sit down for a major interview with Tesla and ex-CEO [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk today. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=8.88s)]
*  The partnership upsetting the Hollywood elites rallying around Kamala Harris as the long-running [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=10.32s)]
*  rivalry between entertainment and Silicon Valley enters a new era. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=15.24s)]
*  Here with more, Silicon Valley tech pioneer and former Obama fundraiser, Allison Nguyen. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=19.88s)]
*  Good morning to you, Allison. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=24.48s)]
*  Good morning, Ainsley. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=26.64s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=27.64s)]
*  So, let's divide. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=28.64s)]
*  Why do you think there are some people, there are very wealthy people in Silicon Valley [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=29.84s)]
*  that are supporting Donald Trump, but you have Hollywood supporting Kamala? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=33.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=37.16s)]
*  Well, I think this is another narrative of us versus them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=38.16s)]
*  And the new Republican party is always about unification, right? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=44.28s)]
*  Especially under Trump and also with Elon Musk. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  If you think about it, Hollywood dreams of these big ideas and Silicon Valley makes [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=53.8s)]
*  it a reality. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  Robotics with C-3PO, AI and augmented reality with Minority Report, spinner cars, electric [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=60.04s)]
*  cars, flying cars. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=69.8s)]
*  So we have a great collaboration together. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=71.24s)]
*  And I know Elon Musk personally. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=74.32s)]
*  I've been on vacation with him. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=77.16s)]
*  He's one of the nicest people I've ever met. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  He gave up his bedroom on a private plane for me and my daughter. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=82.0s)]
*  He could have thought that I was just a nanny. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=86.36s)]
*  I'm a Silicon Valley soccer mom. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=88.92s)]
*  And he sat at the back of the plane with the staff and gave that bedroom to me. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=91.6s)]
*  And every day on our vacation, we got to know each other. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=98.92s)]
*  He woke up in the morning. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=103.34s)]
*  He was the first one to wake up. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=104.68s)]
*  He was the last one to go to sleep. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=106.14s)]
*  He made these dreams a reality. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=108.22000000000001s)]
*  And he actually played chess with my daughter every morning. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=110.18s)]
*  The first two times, she cried because he never let her win. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=115.06s)]
*  He doesn't see a difference between black, white, male, female. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=119.22000000000001s)]
*  If you look at his record, Linda is the CEO of Twitter. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=124.5s)]
*  Gwen's the CEO of SpaceX, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=127.94000000000001s)]
*  And he wants parents to have the same rights as transsexual children. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  He's not gonna give up on that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  He doesn't give up on people. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=138.2s)]
*  And I do believe Donald Trump is the same way who I've dined with several times. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=140.2s)]
*  I have another story about Donald Trump, and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm very excited about this mashup, this interview. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  I was there with one of my best friends, and she looks almost like Letitia James. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=153.32s)]
*  And he treated us very nicely during the middle of his trial. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=159.0s)]
*  So I'm very excited about this mashup. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHwK7qfz9s&t=164.04s)]
