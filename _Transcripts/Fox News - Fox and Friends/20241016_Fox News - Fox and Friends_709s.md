# 'The fear card': Harris ramps up outrageous claims against Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8)
*  So can you can you imagine black voters, especially black males saying this is what we want. We want our economy to work for us [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=0.0s)]
*  We want to just afford things day to day on the basis. We hate what's happening at the border [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Because they're taking job different resources from our communities [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=12.56s)]
*  We don't like what's happening in the schools today with them trying to replace their parents with all this reproductive stuff and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=16.6s)]
*  Transgender stuff and then you have a this is what we want to see [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=23.82s)]
*  We tell you what the issues that matter to us and then releasing a policy proposal [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=26.92s)]
*  With stuff that we never said that we want it from the government and they think this is gonna work three weeks before election [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=31.360000000000003s)]
*  I'm not sure she gets a bump after this. Well, it's clear pandering. We were talking about that yesterday [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=38.92s)]
*  One of the reasons Kamala Harris is stepping outside of her comfort zone [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  She's gonna be on special report with Brett tonight and he's gonna ask he is just you know, he is the best in the business [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  He's gonna ask some really good questions [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=56.32s)]
*  political playbook talked a little bit [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=58.4s)]
*  This morning about why she would appear on Fox and essentially what they said is she's trying to expand her appeal to people who? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=61.36s)]
*  don't normally [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=68.84s)]
*  You know vote [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=70.84s)]
*  Democratic and that is in particular they suggest [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=73.6s)]
*  Fox News has a lot of Nikki Haley [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=77.44s)]
*  Republicans who are still shopping around they suggest so is that what's going on? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=80.76s)]
*  We don't know but we just know she's gonna sit down with Brett and she's gonna take a bunch of questions and tomorrow morning [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=85.84s)]
*  We're gonna talk about her answers. Yeah, when you look at when you hear Kamala Harris [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=91.28s)]
*  We're gonna play a little bit of the Charlemagne de Garde interview [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=95.16s)]
*  Her plans don't help a lot of families and including like student loan forgiveness. That's gonna be one trillion dollars [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  $25,000 for her first time homebuyers. This isn't gonna help any of us, right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  20 billion for forgivable loans for African Americans promise to and promise to consider this [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=111.48s)]
*  Reparation plan that's gonna be multi trillion dollars promises to legalize weed. Well, I don't smoke pot [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=117.08s)]
*  I don't think any of y'all do either that's not gonna help [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=122.78s)]
*  Sex change surgeries for illegals and convicted criminals. Did you expect us to say whether or not we smoke pot? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=125.28s)]
*  That is the black community smokes more for black males, yeah, which is it would be an insult [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=133.2s)]
*  Not even the number one consumer of of weed well and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=139.0s)]
*  Charlemagne de Garde asked her about that, you know [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=143.88s)]
*  You roll out this initiative aimed at black men and talk about pot and she said that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=146.24s)]
*  Certain demographics are disproportionately impacted by marijuana laws. All right, so let's talk about has been against [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=152.18s)]
*  Essentially changing the schedule on marijuana for a long time [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=160.16s)]
*  All right [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=163.34s)]
*  Let's talk about one thing that she one thing about Kamala Harris and we watched it for the last three and a half years [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  And we watched it when she was a candidate repeats herself over and over again that she has talking points and she repeats him [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=168.45999999999998s)]
*  And now she's trying to run from them and never explaining why she changed her mind on those talking points [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=174.16s)]
*  And now that she's a candidate. She's got her same talking points Charlemagne [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=178.55999999999997s)]
*  Who's known her since she was out in Los Angeles? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=182.0s)]
*  Asked her about that criticism about how she sticks to the script. Listen [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  What do you say to people who say you stay on the talking points? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=189.92s)]
*  I would say you're welcome. Mm-hmm. I mean listen, here's the thing [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=193.67999999999998s)]
*  I love having conversations [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=197.6s)]
*  which is why I'm so happy to be with you this afternoon and the reality is that there are certain things that must be repeated to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=200.2s)]
*  ensure that I [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=207.61999999999998s)]
*  Have everyone know what I stand for and the issues that I think are at stake in this election [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  And so it requires repetition, you know, some people say that if until someone has heard the same thing at least three times [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=214.2s)]
*  It just doesn't stay with you [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=220.92s)]
*  They say that in marketing [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=224.04s)]
*  You tell them what you're gonna tell them you tell them and then you tell them what they told him [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=225.88s)]
*  But ultimately it just seems like she repeats [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=229.48s)]
*  Well, he originally said some say you have an inability to fearlessly say who you are and what you believe [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=231.88s)]
*  We all feel that way about her. She said there's certain things that must be repeated [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=238.88s)]
*  Like you heard she said I say the same thing when I go to Detroit as I do in Philly to make sure the people [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  Hear and receive what I think because if you go to each of our rallies [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=248.2s)]
*  It's in a teleprompter and she just repeats the same speech over and over so so the question is first is thank you a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  Proper response to that it just are you welcome? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=259.44s)]
*  Yeah, so I just don't I don't understand why that was even incorporated in her response [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=263.24s)]
*  The second thing is no one is no one is saying that she can't be like any other politician have a stump speech [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=269.64s)]
*  You know some of the most effective politicians do they they have a theme and they hit that stump [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=276.12s)]
*  That stump speech every single stop that they go into and there's something memorable [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=280.88s)]
*  The problem is the stuff that she puts out there. It's not something that you want to be repeated again [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=285.44s)]
*  It's just a word salad right each time but a couple of things this will never happen again [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  Because we're never I don't think in our lifetime ever gonna have a politician untested just anointed [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=295.4s)]
*  Right. Oh, so if she came out and said these ever had it before [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=300.35999999999996s)]
*  Then they go and they go for eight months. They fight with each other [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=303.23999999999995s)]
*  They have debates they have they have town halls and then they lose a debate they win a debate and then there's [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=306.4s)]
*  Caucus primary caucus primary in out and then all of a sudden you have a own message [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=311.8s)]
*  So no one would ever accuse if someone again are just saying with your talking points because you can't win that way [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=316.4s)]
*  She was anointed burst out. This is what she's saying hope to coast right holes drop and now she's got to go engage [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=321.68s)]
*  Everywhere rapidly and we're seeing that would sing in many ways [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=330.76s)]
*  Spin out of control and we're gonna find out tonight if she's gonna survive it [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  I also think the other thing they're gonna do is try to make Trump unelectable again [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  And they're not bringing up the legal stuff because that makes him stronger what they're gonna try to say is he's lost his money [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=344.68s)]
*  78 and he's kind of crazy. He's crazy [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=349.88s)]
*  And by the way, they talk about what happened at ABC [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=351.76s)]
*  they talk about what happened the other night and with him playing DJ and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=354.48s)]
*  It's a total lie to see do you know I watched Terry Moran who is not a Trump fan [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=359.24s)]
*  I watch him be pretty abrasive. He covered this story said I know on the outside it looked kind of different [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=364.38s)]
*  But on the inside the spirit was great. It was really a great moment. That is an ABC reporter [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=371.7s)]
*  We've been doing it for 40 years were injured. They had to bring in medical care, right? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=377.84s)]
*  So I don't want to keep breaking it [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=381.34s)]
*  I don't want to get too far off [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=383.14s)]
*  But I was just trying to say yeah, they're trying to make him unelectable and they're trying to scare people [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=384.21999999999997s)]
*  They were all good. Any enemies are gonna be arrested in jail. Listen [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=388.1s)]
*  Hi, I'm Bobby from Georgia and I have a question for Kamala Harris [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=395.38s)]
*  Could you please respond to Trump's claim that he's going to use the alien enemies act of? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=400.58s)]
*  1798 to round up immigrants if he wins the election [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=407.3s)]
*  This law was last used to put Asian Americans in internment camps during World War two [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=411.86s)]
*  And I have a sneaking suspicion that if Trump wins, he's going to use this law to put [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=417.21999999999997s)]
*  Anyone that doesn't look white in camps and I'm scared [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=422.38s)]
*  Yeah, so [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=428.90000000000003s)]
*  You've hit on a really important point and expressed it. I think so well, which is [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=430.46000000000004s)]
*  He is achieving his intended effect to make you scared [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=437.34000000000003s)]
*  He is running full-time on a campaign that is about instilling fear [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=442.22s)]
*  Not about hope not about [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=446.90000000000003s)]
*  Optimism not about the future but about fear and so this is yet another example [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=450.0s)]
*  And you know what the irony is that she's been playing the fear card. She's playing the fear cards and also it's illegal immigrants [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=457.64s)]
*  It's not just immigrants in general [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=464.64s)]
*  And also was there a follow-up to say the majority of Americans now support mass deportation of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=466.64s)]
*  Legal immigrants, it's not a fear tactic [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=473.84s)]
*  You know who's people the people in fear the people that have had guns pointed at them in their own apartment complexes taking over [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=476.0s)]
*  Bodegas going after people in the middle of Times Square the old ladies with the purses being stripped on people on mopeds [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=483.56s)]
*  That shouldn't be in the country. Those are the people that are fearful right now [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=489.42s)]
*  Well, and so there she is talking about how Donald Trump is, you know, it's a bad guy threat to democracy [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=492.68s)]
*  We've heard all that stuff a million times by now [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=498.96s)]
*  What's interesting is during her interview with with Charlemagne the god [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=501.71999999999997s)]
*  It was you know, he did ask some good questions [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=506.96s)]
*  He had some good questions and she said stuff we have not heard her say before which is interesting [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  However, it's gonna investigate reparations. She's gonna consider that well [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=515.64s)]
*  well [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8&t=519.16s)]
