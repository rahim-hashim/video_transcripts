*  So you're the owner? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  My son's the owner [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  Oh you did that very nice and easy huh? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=53.879999999999995s)]

*  He's great, he's better [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=57.88s)]
*  Thank you very much [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=59.88s)]
*  So Mr. President, you know I've been going to the barbershops all across the country [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=61.88s)]
*  So I wanted to have a natural conversation [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=64.88s)]
*  You know with these folks right here [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=66.88s)]
*  So this fellow right here, he used to be in law enforcement for some years [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=68.88s)]
*  What would you say is the most important issue facing the country right now? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=72.88s)]
*  For me, it's the border [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=76.88s)]
*  Right, right [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=78.88s)]
*  And how to control that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=80.88s)]
*  How to control that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=82.88s)]
*  How to keep illegal migrants from coming into the country [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=84.88s)]
*  Very important for me [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=89.88s)]
*  And if I had a question to ask about it would be [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=91.88s)]
*  How do we do the, how do we control the city, sanctuary city? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=96.88s)]
*  Because New York is a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=102.88s)]
*  We get rid of them [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=104.88s)]
*  Because they're sanctuary, you know what they're for? Criminals [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=106.88s)]
*  And all over the country, the criminals go there [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=108.88s)]
*  But you're right, you know the polls are showing that inflation and the border [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=111.88s)]
*  Not the border, the border is third [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=115.88s)]
*  They have inflation and the economy [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=117.88s)]
*  As the number one and number two issue, I disagree [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=119.88s)]
*  I think inflation is massive [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=122.88s)]
*  The economy is massive [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=125.88s)]
*  But the border to me is like, it's the fabric of our country [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=127.88s)]
*  And we had the strongest border in recorded history [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=130.88s)]
*  Four years ago you had a border, you didn't have the problems that you have now [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=134.88s)]
*  Last week they announced that we had 13,099 convicted murderers [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=137.88s)]
*  Released from jails all over the world [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=143.88s)]
*  You know it's not South America, it's all over the world [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=145.88s)]
*  Including South America [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=147.88s)]
*  So I agree with you, I think the biggest problem we have is the border [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=149.88s)]
*  It's something, and it's also the hardest thing to solve [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=153.88s)]
*  And the only way you can solve it, you have to get the criminals, the murderers [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=156.88s)]
*  You gotta get them out, you gotta get them out fast before they prey on our people [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=160.88s)]
*  That was a big question for me because I'm a retired New York City detective [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=164.88s)]
*  So in New York here we've run across that for a long time [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=169.88s)]
*  Well the other problem you have is that you're not allowed to do your job [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=173.88s)]
*  And when you were there, you go back 10, 15 years, when you were there [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=176.88s)]
*  You were allowed to do your job [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=181.88s)]
*  New York's finest, they're still New York's finest, but they're not allowed to do their job [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=183.88s)]
*  So when you were president, I know for a fact I was able to do three things [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=186.88s)]
*  I was able to see money, save money, spend money [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=190.88s)]
*  Now in the past, almost four years now, I'm losing my business basically [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=193.88s)]
*  The money's just not there [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=198.88s)]
*  It's your business? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=200.88s)]
*  It's my business, I started it for the past 10 years [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=201.88s)]
*  And the only time I knew I made it was when you were in office, so I could speak for myself [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=204.88s)]
*  And the thing is it's like, I don't know what more to do [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=208.88s)]
*  How can we make the economy come back? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=211.88s)]
*  How do you get to the bottom of this? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=214.88s)]
*  So here's what we're doing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=216.88s)]
*  Number one, it all began with the oil, they screwed around with what I did with oil [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=218.88s)]
*  We had the greatest, we were energy independent [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=221.88s)]
*  You remember back four or five years ago, $1.87 for a gallon of gas [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=224.88s)]
*  We actually had it lower than that for your car [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=229.88s)]
*  $1.87, now it's at three and a half, but it was much higher [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=232.88s)]
*  They brought back my policies to break even, but by that time the damage was done [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=237.88s)]
*  And now you have inflation and you have the cost so high, and they haven't gone down [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=242.88s)]
*  We're going to do two things [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=247.88s)]
*  The interest rates are going down, it's going to be brought down, it's going to be brought down fast [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=249.88s)]
*  But much more importantly and quicker, we're going to drill baby drill [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=253.88s)]
*  You've heard that, right? Drill, baby drill [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=256.88s)]
*  We're going to get our oil, we're going to have much more of it [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=259.88s)]
*  That we're going to do four to five times more than we're doing right now [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=261.88s)]
*  We can do that, these people are amazing, they can do it [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=265.88s)]
*  And we'll be supplying it to Asia, we'll be supplying it to Europe, we'll be supplying it to everywhere [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=268.88s)]
*  And that's going to bring down prices, it's going to bring down the cost of everything [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=273.88s)]
*  If you make donuts, when you look at these stores, they have trucks that deliver [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=277.88s)]
*  They have stoves and ovens, you have your lighting, you have all this equipment [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=282.88s)]
*  And all of that electric equipment that he's using on your beautiful head of hair [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=287.88s)]
*  You have a good looking head of hair [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=290.88s)]
*  I'm jealous, look at that flat top, I'd have a flat top [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=294.88s)]
*  I wish I had a flat top [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=297.88s)]
*  You never had a hair loss problem, did you? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=299.88s)]
*  Lucky, he's one of those gifted ones [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=303.88s)]
*  What you do, those machines are very expensive [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=307.88s)]
*  They're running the machines that electric [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=310.88s)]
*  When that comes down, like in a shop like this, no matter what you do, it's about energy [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=312.88s)]
*  We're going to bring it down, we're going to get the prices down [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=316.88s)]
*  How's your rent done in terms of, do you own the store or is it rented? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=319.88s)]
*  No, it's rented [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=322.88s)]
*  And is the landlord a good guy, is he okay? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=323.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he's a good guy [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=325.88s)]
*  He's alright, did you cut his hair I hope? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=326.88s)]
*  I mean, he comes in from time to time [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=327.88s)]
*  You know what, if you're as good as your father says, and you cut his hair great [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=331.88s)]
*  That's very important to barber to a guy [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=336.88s)]
*  So he could be a wealthy landlord, but he'll give you a low rent [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=338.88s)]
*  Because having a good barber is a very important thing, I can tell you [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=340.88s)]
*  So Mr. President, you got a young guy right there [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=344.88s)]
*  That's a big thing though [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=346.88s)]
*  It's a huge thing [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=347.88s)]
*  So how is your rent then? So where was it like five years ago, the rent? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=348.88s)]
*  I mean, the rent was significantly lower [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=351.88s)]
*  Now it's gone up about $1,200 since [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=356.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's okay, it's a big increase [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=363.88s)]
*  And my issue was more of the energy [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=366.88s)]
*  I've been paying $2,100 since I first opened up [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=369.88s)]
*  In the last seven months it shot up to $15,000 [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=373.88s)]
*  What? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=377.88s)]
*  It's $15,000 [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=378.88s)]
*  You went from $2,100 to $15,000 in this establishment, yeah [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=379.88s)]
*  How many heads can you take care of? That's a lot, right? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=383.88s)]
*  It's like by stealing [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=387.88s)]
*  So what? From $2,100 to $15,000? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=389.88s)]
*  So there's an example though, energy, right? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=393.88s)]
*  So energy, when that comes down, ready? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=396.88s)]
*  I almost hate to say because you'd be at $7,000, right? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=399.88s)]
*  But your energy bill from January 20th, if I win, we gotta win [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=402.88s)]
*  And we're in New York, and these guys love New York [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=408.88s)]
*  If we win, oh I love this guy, look at that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=413.88s)]
*  Give me that hat, I'm gonna sign it [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=417.88s)]
*  Come on, give me that hat [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=419.88s)]
*  That's, I love this guy [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=421.88s)]
*  Thank you very much, that's beautiful [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=423.88s)]
*  I'll sign yours too, look at that one [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=426.88s)]
*  So what's... [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=429.88s)]
*  I don't know why [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=432.88s)]
*  He's gonna keep busy for a long time [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=434.88s)]
*  So let me ask you, how much is it like a haircut, an average haircut? Guy comes in, he wants... [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=436.88s)]
*  $30, $40? Right now [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=440.88s)]
*  What did it used to be? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=442.88s)]
*  $15, $12, $15, yeah [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=444.88s)]
*  We're talking about 10 years ago [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=446.88s)]
*  We had to make it make sense [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=448.88s)]
*  You can't charge a regular price, especially out here [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=451.88s)]
*  Do you have guys like these guys, do they come in and negotiate the price? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=454.88s)]
*  Yeah [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=457.88s)]
*  They probably do, I would think [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=459.88s)]
*  What's your question for the president? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=461.88s)]
*  What is the plan to do about the fast, the food healthcare industry [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=463.88s)]
*  and getting the artificial foods banned in our urban communities [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=467.88s)]
*  that have less access to organic whole foods? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=472.88s)]
*  So Bobby Kennedy, right? Everybody likes Bobby Kennedy [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=476.88s)]
*  And he's so big into the health food and women things, everything [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=479.88s)]
*  He wants to do things in the environment [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=484.88s)]
*  And he endorsed me, first time a Kennedy's ever endorsed a Republican [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=487.88s)]
*  Maybe it's gonna be the last, but I doubt it [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=490.88s)]
*  And he's a great guy, he would be so perfect [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=493.88s)]
*  He doesn't like artificial foods and he doesn't like pesticides and all the stuff they put on them [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=495.88s)]
*  And if you listen to him for 10 minutes, I mean he says other countries that don't do anything are healthier than us, okay? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=500.88s)]
*  We're not that healthy, to put it mildly [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=505.88s)]
*  So no artificial foods, we don't want artificial foods [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=508.88s)]
*  We have plenty of food, the food isn't our problem [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=511.88s)]
*  And our farmers are great, and our farmers aren't allowed to do their job [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=514.88s)]
*  You know, our farmers did great [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=517.88s)]
*  Four years ago they were doing just about the best they've ever done [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=519.88s)]
*  They're not doing well at all now [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=522.88s)]
*  We're not gonna have artificial foods, we don't want artificial foods [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=524.88s)]
*  We want healthy foods, and a lot of things are gonna be going [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=527.88s)]
*  And I'll tell you, I'm gonna have Bobby Kennedy involved in it [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=530.88s)]
*  He's a great guy [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=532.88s)]
*  And even the way when I mentioned his name, all you guys, and you're tough cookies [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=533.88s)]
*  You know, you wouldn't think, sometimes you'd say maybe you wouldn't like a guy like Bobby [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=537.88s)]
*  But he, he's a person that talks more about food and health than anything else [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=541.88s)]
*  So I think that's cool, so we'll get it, we'll get it taken care of [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=547.88s)]
*  You'll be healthier in four years from now than you are now [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=550.88s)]
*  And you look very healthy to me, by the way [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=555.88s)]
*  Thank you, go ahead [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=557.88s)]
*  What do you have for the president? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=558.88s)]
*  My biggest concern is the future, and the future generation, my kids' generation [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=559.88s)]
*  A lot of people are worried that attaining the American dream at this point in time [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=565.88s)]
*  And in the near future is gonna be unattainable for this upcoming generation [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=569.88s)]
*  Which I have kids that are part of that generation [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=572.88s)]
*  How many kids do you have? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=575.88s)]
*  I have two, a 17 and an 18 year old [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=577.88s)]
*  Now, the big, I believe one of the biggest hurdles we have when it comes to attaining that American dream is over taxation [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=579.88s)]
*  When it comes to federal taxes, I know you, we're gonna bring back, I'm sure you're gonna start back up the pipeline [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=590.88s)]
*  The Keystone pipeline, which is gonna generate an abundance of revenue [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=596.88s)]
*  Also with the tariffs that you've spoken of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=601.88s)]
*  So my question is, with all this extra revenue we're gonna be bringing into the country [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=603.88s)]
*  So do you believe at some point in time we could find a way once the country's back on its feet [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=607.88s)]
*  And getting enough revenue and paid off our debt? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=612.88s)]
*  Do you think it's possible to find a way to eliminate federal taxes? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=614.88s)]
*  There is a way [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=617.88s)]
*  There is a way [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=618.88s)]
*  And how do you feel about it? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=619.88s)]
*  You know, in the old days, when we were smart, when we were a smart country [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=620.88s)]
*  In the 1890s and all [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=623.88s)]
*  This is when the country was relatively the richest it ever was [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=625.88s)]
*  It had all tariffs, it didn't have an income tax [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=629.88s)]
*  Yes sir [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=631.88s)]
*  Okay? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=632.88s)]
*  Now we have income taxes and we have people that are dying, they're paying tax and they don't have the money to pay the tax [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=633.88s)]
*  No, in the old days, 1890, 1880, we had so much money they had to set up committees, blue ribbon committees [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=638.88s)]
*  How to spend our wealth, we had no idea how to spend it with so much money [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=646.88s)]
*  Then we went to the income tax system and the rest is sort of history [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=650.88s)]
*  But no, there is a way, I mean, if we, if what I'm planning comes out [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=654.88s)]
*  It's a great question by the way [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=659.88s)]
*  Everyone could have taken their money [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=660.88s)]
*  You know, a sophisticated cat, you know? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=662.88s)]
*  Everyone could attain the American dream if it wasn't for the high cost, the burden of high taxes [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=664.88s)]
*  And we're taxed at every step of the way [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=670.88s)]
*  When we make it, when we spend it [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=672.88s)]
*  And regulations, and regulations [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=673.88s)]
*  So I cut more regulations in four years than any other president by four times [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=675.88s)]
*  Let's go, you wanna ask one question [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=679.88s)]
*  What is one thing that you probably feel like you didn't do in your first term that you feel like you could do better now? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=681.88s)]
*  I'll tell you the one thing, because I did, you know, look, we had the best economy with the best boarder [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=687.88s)]
*  We had a lot of, so I did a lot of good stuff, rebuilt the military [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=691.88s)]
*  It's all about people, I gotta get, the right people [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=695.88s)]
*  You know, when I went there, I won [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=698.88s)]
*  92% of the presidents, 92% for the whole history of our country were politicians [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=700.88s)]
*  8% were generals, no admirals, 8% were, that's it, that's 100%, 92 and 8 [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=706.88s)]
*  There were politicians and there were generals, General Washington, you know, et cetera, et cetera, George Washington [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=713.88s)]
*  Thank you, you're doing very good at that [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=718.88s)]
*  I'm just gonna sign this out, give me this [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=720.88s)]
*  I got longer arms than you [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=723.88s)]
*  You do have longer arms [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=724.88s)]
*  So they were, so here's what we do [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=726.88s)]
*  We take all of that and we come, and here comes Donald Trump down the line [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=730.88s)]
*  And so it's about people, it's all about people [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=735.88s)]
*  I went to Washington 17 times in my entire life [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=739.88s)]
*  So I wasn't a Washington person, I was a New York person [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=742.88s)]
*  So when I went to Washington, all of a sudden I'm standing in the White House opposite the Lincoln bedroom [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=746.88s)]
*  And I said, man, this is so amazing, but I didn't really know too many [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=751.88s)]
*  So I had to rely on people to give me recommendations for people [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=754.88s)]
*  To run agencies, to be secretary of this, secretary of that, all big stuff [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=758.88s)]
*  And I didn't know anybody, I had to rely [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=763.88s)]
*  And I still did great [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=765.88s)]
*  Look, we rebuilt the military, we docked out ISIS, we did all these things [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=766.88s)]
*  We did great, we had the best economy, we had the best everything [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=769.88s)]
*  Everything was good, but I had some people that if I had it to do again I wouldn't have used [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=772.88s)]
*  Now I've been there four years, plus another four that I'm sort of there in a way [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=776.88s)]
*  I know the best people [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=781.88s)]
*  To me it's all about people, you gotta have the right people [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=783.88s)]
*  We have the best people lined up, we're gonna do a great job [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=786.88s)]
*  Listen, so I'm going down to see the Wall Street Journal [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=788.88s)]
*  If I had my choice I'd stay with you for two, three hours because you guys are great [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=791.88s)]
*  You guys are the same as me, it's the same stuff, we were born the same way [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=795.88s)]
*  I grew up in Queens and all of that [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=800.88s)]
*  I mean, you know, I had a great father, I had a father who was a great guy [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=802.88s)]
*  He was tough but good, big heart, big, big heart [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=806.88s)]
*  And he was a construction guy, pretty much, and a real estate guy [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=810.88s)]
*  And I learned a lot from him, he was great [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=815.88s)]
*  But I know you people so well without knowing you, I know you so well [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=817.88s)]
*  When I walked in here I said this is home territory [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=822.88s)]
*  And I really appreciate it, and you are fantastic, I bet he's a fantastic father [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=826.88s)]
*  Take care of that guy, right? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=830.88s)]
*  I think we've got time for one more, Mr. President, go ahead [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=832.88s)]
*  Is he a good barber too? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=836.88s)]
*  Yeah [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=837.88s)]
*  Who's better, you or him as a barber? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=838.88s)]
*  How long have you worked here? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=840.88s)]
*  Eleven years [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=842.88s)]
*  That's fantastic [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=843.88s)]
*  Could he give me a good haircut, kid? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=845.88s)]
*  You gonna do it? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=847.88s)]
*  I'll do it [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=848.88s)]
*  That's the master right there [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=849.88s)]
*  Who's the master? Is he the best? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=850.88s)]
*  I'm the master right there [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=852.88s)]
*  He's the oldest guy, 35 years, I've been coming here for 35 years [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=853.88s)]
*  He looks like a young guy [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=856.88s)]
*  I've been coming at him since 1991 [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=858.88s)]
*  He did a good job with your boy, I'll tell you, right? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=860.88s)]
*  He did a good job with your son, huh? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=862.88s)]
*  He's a great kid [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=864.88s)]
*  And you have other kids too? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=865.88s)]
*  Yeah, I've got four, four all together, two girls and two boys [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=867.88s)]
*  I'll bet all good [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=870.88s)]
*  They're all doing great [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=871.88s)]
*  I can look at him and see that you all turned out [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=872.88s)]
*  I'm happy, I'm at peace [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=874.88s)]
*  Do they work here too at all? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=875.88s)]
*  No, no, one of them works with him in his restaurant [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=876.88s)]
*  Two of them work with me [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=879.88s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=880.88s)]
*  I'm a real estate investor and I own a restaurant and a bar [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=881.88s)]
*  Good, great, great, you look great [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=885.88s)]
*  I'm here next to the president, I gotta look great [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=888.88s)]
*  President, I think we can say here, collectively [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=892.88s)]
*  I met all these guys today for the first time [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=894.88s)]
*  But we all love America just like you [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=896.88s)]
*  And that's why we're here [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=898.88s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=900.88s)]
*  Really nice, thank you [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=901.88s)]
*  So I gotta tell you, if you've been watching Fox for years [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=904.88s)]
*  I've been talking about the barbershop for years [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=907.88s)]
*  And he's the first candidate that said, okay, I'll go [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=909.88s)]
*  I'll go talk with the people [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=912.88s)]
*  I've been asking Republicans [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=913.88s)]
*  If you want to reach a different demographic [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=914.88s)]
*  Then you gotta meet them where they are [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=917.88s)]
*  And he did it [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=919.88s)]
*  Brian was asking you, you said, are they Republicans or the Democrats? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=920.88s)]
*  Maybe that was Carly that was asking you [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=923.88s)]
*  Some of them Democrats, some of them Republicans [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=924.88s)]
*  Some of them have never voted for a Republican before [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=927.88s)]
*  But Donald Trump [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=930.88s)]
*  So it's gonna be interesting [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=931.88s)]
*  I'm still gonna complete the series [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=933.88s)]
*  I got Atlanta that's gonna be coming up [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=935.88s)]
*  And it's a mix of people [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=937.88s)]
*  Some of the folks in the barbershop are Democrats [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=939.88s)]
*  Some of them are Republicans [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=940.88s)]
*  Some of them are voting for Kamala Harris [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=941.88s)]
*  Some of them voting for Donald Trump [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=943.88s)]
*  But we've never seen this amount of support [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=944.88s)]
*  From black Americans, Hispanic Americans for a Republican [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=948.88s)]
*  That's why we're doing it [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=953.88s)]
*  And there's also, remember, he had a huge rally in the Bronx [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=954.88s)]
*  Because he was stuck in court [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=957.88s)]
*  And now he's gonna end up Sunday at Madison Square Garden [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=959.88s)]
*  People are like, why is he in New York? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=962.88s)]
*  Well, if he's, you can't tell the president he can't win New York [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=963.88s)]
*  He's like, are you kidding me? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=967.88s)]
*  Where I go, I'm getting crowds [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=968.88s)]
*  I think he takes it personal because he's from New York [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=970.88s)]
*  And he wants people to know that they have a shot [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=973.88s)]
*  We're gonna have more of this later on in the show [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=975.88s)]
*  Also tomorrow we got a little bit more of the conversation [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=977.88s)]
*  I just think it's great [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=980.88s)]
*  I can't believe that guy's energy bill [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=981.88s)]
*  Yeah [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=983.88s)]
*  $15,000 [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=984.88s)]
*  And it just increased [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=985.88s)]
*  It was $1,200 and now it's $15,000 [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=987.88s)]
*  In fairness to the landlord, the landlord's getting billed [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=989.88s)]
*  He can't lose money [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=991.88s)]
*  I know, I know [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=992.88s)]
*  I'm not saying he's casual [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=993.88s)]
*  I'm not saying that [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=994.88s)]
*  I'm just saying I can't believe energy costs have gone up that much [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=995.88s)]
*  That's gone up [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=997.88s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=998.88s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVdEzIlScp4&t=999.88s)]
