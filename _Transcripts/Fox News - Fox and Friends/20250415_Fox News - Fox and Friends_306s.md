# Trump suggests tariffs could replace income tax: 'There's a chance'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM)
*  How about Rachel's interview with the president? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's talk about that. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=1.72s)]
*  Rachel Campos-Duffy speaking exclusively with President Trump. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=2.72s)]
*  The full interview airing today at 4 p.m. on Fox Noticias. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Trump covering a wide range of topics, including his work with El Salvador's president on immigration. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=10.4s)]
*  He's made it a very safe place. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=16.6s)]
*  People go and they feel very secure and safe. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=18.16s)]
*  He's also built one, but other also prisons, very big ones, and we're using his system [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=21.12s)]
*  because we're getting rid of our criminals from out of the United States. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=27.44s)]
*  So we're allowed to come in by Biden. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  We're getting them out. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  And the president is helping us with that, President Bukele. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=34.64s)]
*  So I was very impressed with him. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=40.36s)]
*  Really very impressed. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=41.68s)]
*  Could we use it for violent criminals, our own violent criminals? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=42.84s)]
*  I call them homegrown criminals. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=47.44s)]
*  I mean, the homegrown ones, the ones that grew up and something went wrong and they [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=49.2s)]
*  hit people over the head with a baseball bat. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=53.36s)]
*  We have and push people into subways just before the train gets there, like you see [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  happening sometimes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=61.68s)]
*  We are looking into it and we want to do it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=63.76s)]
*  I would love to do that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=65.76s)]
*  Or set people on fire that are waiting on the subway. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=67.76s)]
*  Yeah, the worst of the worst here with more is Fox and Friends Weekend co-host at the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=70.72s)]
*  White House, Rachel Campos-Duffy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=74.32s)]
*  Hey, Rachel, congratulations. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=76.0s)]
*  Hey, Ainsley, thanks so much. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=77.28s)]
*  It was such an exciting day here at the White House. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=78.88s)]
*  I was here when President Bukele came in. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  The military were right behind us with flags, you know, greeting him. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=83.52s)]
*  He drove up. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=87.44s)]
*  He came into the meeting and we got to interview Donald Trump right as he got out of that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=88.16s)]
*  amazing Oval Office presser and interview with President Bukele. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  And you know, you could really sense, you know, right out of the gate out of this interview, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  I asked him about Bukele. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=102.88s)]
*  He likes Bukele. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  He relates to that kind of toughness. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=105.52s)]
*  President Bukele, of course, taking El Salvador from the murder capital of the world [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=108.16s)]
*  to the safest country in the Western hemisphere. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=112.48s)]
*  And when Donald Trump said, you know, President Bukele said, hey, everyone's talking about [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=115.92s)]
*  my prisons and the thousands that are in there, but they don't talk enough about the millions [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=121.44s)]
*  that I've liberated, which is really true in El Salvador. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=126.16s)]
*  It is like night and day. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=128.96s)]
*  And Donald Trump didn't just like that Bukele, you know, made his country safe again, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=130.32s)]
*  something Donald Trump is working on. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=135.44s)]
*  But he loved the language, you know, the idea of the it takes imprisoning those violent [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  criminals to liberate the rest of the peaceful population just on a marketing level. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=142.08s)]
*  I could tell Donald Trump really liked that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I loved I loved your question on tariffs. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=150.0s)]
*  And we're going to play it right now, because even Donald Trump said, Rachel, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=152.4s)]
*  no one's ever asked me that question. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=155.84s)]
*  So watch this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=157.84s)]
*  Los Aranceles, van a reemplazar el income tax? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=159.68s)]
*  You know, you're the only one that's asked me that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=163.28s)]
*  I deal with all these big financial geniuses. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=166.0s)]
*  Nobody ever. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  There is a chance that the money from tariffs could be so great that it would replace, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=169.52s)]
*  you know, in the old days, 18, about 1870 to 1913, the tariffs were the only form of money. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  And that's when our nation was relatively the richest. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  We were the richest. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=186.96s)]
*  And Rachel, you also taught him how to say, let's make America great again in Spanish. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=188.56s)]
*  Watch this, everyone. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=192.96s)]
*  The theme of this was make America great again. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=195.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  And it's so easy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=199.52s)]
*  People said if you didn't win, this country was going to fail. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=200.56s)]
*  It was going to fail. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=203.52s)]
*  It was financially in other ways. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  It was going to fail, maybe even worse in so many other ways with all of this horrible stuff [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=206.4s)]
*  that they made you believe. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=211.44s)]
*  Our country was going to be a big failure and it wasn't going to be long. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=213.68s)]
*  I guess we're very close to 100 days, actually. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  And in this short period of time, we have made such an impact. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=220.4s)]
*  We're respected all over the world again. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=224.8s)]
*  Mr. President, I'd like to teach you how to say let's make America great again in Spanish. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=226.88s)]
*  So, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=230.72s)]
*  vamos a hacer America grande otra vez. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=231.2s)]
*  America grande otra vez. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=234.56s)]
*  Otra vez. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=240.64s)]
*  It was so great. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=242.72s)]
*  Rachel, sorry to interrupt you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=244.72s)]
*  He picked out America grande otra vez. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=245.6s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  Listen, back to the tariffs really quickly. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=252.24s)]
*  So important. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=254.72s)]
*  The tariffs are just another form of revenue. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=255.44s)]
*  And so he's saying if we can make this happen, we might be able to eliminate the income tax, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=258.48s)]
*  which of course would be transformative. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=263.04s)]
*  By the way, I do have a degree in economics from a state school. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=265.44s)]
*  So all those fancy economists that are talking to him, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=268.8s)]
*  my parents saved some money at Arizona State University. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=271.28s)]
*  So I got my econ question in and he seemed to like it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=274.24s)]
*  Well, you're not allowed to leave Fox and go join the administration, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=277.84s)]
*  but that was an excellent idea. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=280.24s)]
*  I would personally love to keep that money, the tax dollars. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=281.84s)]
*  If we can make so much money on these tariffs, that'd be great. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=285.04s)]
*  What a wonderful question. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  Great interview. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=288.56s)]
*  Congratulations, my friend. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=289.2s)]
*  Thank you, Ainsley. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=291.12s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=291.92s)]
*  We'll be watching at four o'clock. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=292.56s)]
*  Fox News, you see us. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBiXMMTdrM&t=293.92s)]
