# ‘STUNNED’: Fencer explains why she took a knee against trans opponent
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ)
*  Well, the women's fencer seen in this video is defending her decision to take a knee against her trans opponent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Despite getting disqualified for the forfeit, now she is spreading global awareness to the issue. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=8.0s)]
*  That athlete is Stephanie Turner, and she joins us now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=14.0s)]
*  Stephanie, it's so great to have you on. So many people are looking up to you because you were so courageous. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=18.0s)]
*  Tell me what happened in that moment. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=24.0s)]
*  So, it really leads up. My day really starts the night before when I found out that I was going to be fencing a man. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=28.0s)]
*  And in tournaments such as these, you don't get to know who you're going to be facing until really the last moment after you've warmed up. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=38.0s)]
*  So I went about the tournament as usual, warming up, and then I was given pools, my pool assignments. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=49.0s)]
*  And I saw that Redmond was in my pool. So I had decided that I was going to take a knee and I would go up against him as if it was a regular tournament. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=57.0s)]
*  And at on guard ready, I would take that knee. And then I would explain my position. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=67.0s)]
*  And what did the referee say? What did your coach, your teammates, what happens there? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=74.0s)]
*  I think people were a little stunned. I was asked, what are you doing? And I said, I'm a woman and this is a man and I will not fence this individual. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=83.0s)]
*  This is a women's tournament. And because tournaments, fencing tournaments are so loud, I don't think Redmond heard me explain that to the referee. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=93.0s)]
*  So he comes up to me and I explained the same thing to him. And Redmond responds that, you know, there's a USFA board of directors here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=102.0s)]
*  There's a policy in place that acknowledges me as a woman. If you refuse to fence, you're going to get a black card. You know that, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=116.0s)]
*  And I said, I know. So I kept my knee and my referee was kind of stunned and walked around and tried to get information from various other officials at the tournament. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=126.0s)]
*  You know, we honor suffragists in our country all the time. I mean, to me, you are a true hero, a real feminist. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=139.0s)]
*  So what's your message to those feminists out there, many of them in the Democrat Party who refuse to stand alongside shoulder to shoulder with women like you who are just standing up for your rights to compete against other women, to not be excluded in your own sport because a man wants to. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=147.0s)]
*  Right. I find that the cause is pretty simple. As you say, I mean, I'm a woman competing in women's sports and men have a male advantage over me in female sports. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=167.0s)]
*  Women's sports are designed to demonstrate female athletic excellence, and that gets lost when there are men in the tournament. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=179.0s)]
*  So I would ask that they just join the group of common sense and, you know, defend women's exclusive sports. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=187.0s)]
*  We have a statement from the USA Fencing Association. They said the USA Fencing enacted our current transgender and non-binary athlete policy in 2023. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=203.0s)]
*  The policy was designed to expand access to the sport of fencing and create inclusive, safe space. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=213.0s)]
*  We expect this conversation to be conducted respectfully, whether at our tournaments in online spaces. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=218.0s)]
*  The way to progress is by respectful discussion based on evidence. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=224.0s)]
*  Your response to that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=230.0s)]
*  So this policy was actually came at the heels of a lot of criticism to the USF. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=234.0s)]
*  So though they issued it in 2023, this there were lots of transgender athletes competing in the women's division long before its issuance. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=239.0s)]
*  And with regard to whether this is hateful, it's not. I'm just defending women's exclusive spaces. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=251.0s)]
*  Women are a protected class. We're given rights, privileges and protections based on that class. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=259.0s)]
*  And girls are a doubly protected class of being children, both children and female. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=265.0s)]
*  So when you talk about including women and girls, you need to talk as well about creating exclusive spaces that protect them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=270.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's not inclusion. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=278.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=281.0s)]
*  You cannot have inclusion without exclusion. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=282.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, they're telling me to rap, but I just want to make sure I get in. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=284.0s)]
*  It is not hateful. It is courageous what you did. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=287.0s)]
*  And I hope that your courage is also contagious. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=290.0s)]
*  Thank you, Stephanie. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=294.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=295.0s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsbod8p6SJQ&t=296.0s)]
