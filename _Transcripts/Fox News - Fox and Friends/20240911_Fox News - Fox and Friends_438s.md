# Trump takes questions from swing state voters post-debate
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco)
*  Lawrence Jones who we know you think is doing a great job and he is there he is he's live in a diner [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=0.0s)]
*  He's also in Pennsylvania. He's in Washington, Pennsylvania [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=5.12s)]
*  And he's talking to the people and I think Lawrence right some of the folks in the diner want to ask the president questions [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=8.16s)]
*  That's exactly right. Ainsley. Let's bring it out to the people. Mr [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=14.52s)]
*  President not a lot from the moderators about the issues last night [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=17.38s)]
*  But in this swing state of Pennsylvania these issues are true, sir [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=20.88s)]
*  You own a car dealership part owner of it and you say this is your birthday by the way [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=24.96s)]
*  And what is your question for the president? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  Good morning, President Trump. My question is what are some of the immediate steps that you will take to improve the economy and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=33.24s)]
*  Get us out of this mess that Biden and Harris have left us in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=40.96s)]
*  Right great question. The first thing I do is close up the border people have to come into our country legally [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=44.96s)]
*  They can't come in the way they're doing now [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=50.6s)]
*  We have millions and millions of people coming in even a month on a monthly basis and they're destroying our country and it affects our economy [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  The other thing I do is drill baby drill [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=60.04s)]
*  I'd be drilling and I'd get energy prices and I'll reduce your energy by half within 12 months [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=62.36s)]
*  Half and I hope that Lawrence if you're listening Lawrence, I hope you go and do a little shout-out poll [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=68.0s)]
*  And I don't know the people there, but I love the people there [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=73.4s)]
*  I can see it but why don't you do a shout-out poll who they thought won the debate last night? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=76.4s)]
*  It would be great [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=81.8s)]
*  You know, we always do the poll at the end mr. President I think you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=84.64s)]
*  But mr. President this young lady right here she's concerned about the future of the country [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=95.16s)]
*  She's concerned about the grandkids and she's concerned about the stress on these parents [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=100.08s)]
*  ma'am, what is your president? What is your [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=104.8s)]
*  Question for the former president I would like to know what kind of programs or [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=107.56s)]
*  policies he could implement to reduce the parental stress with parents having to work one to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  Have family members who are working three jobs trying to make ends meet right now [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=118.36s)]
*  Yeah, spending more and more time away from their families. That's right. Well, we have big [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=122.84s)]
*  You know, what are you gonna do on day one? Mr. President, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=127.64s)]
*  Child care is a number one priority and I have no choice because I have a daughter named Ivanka and maybe you never heard of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=130.73999999999998s)]
*  my Ivanka, but I have a daughter named Ivanka and that's all she talks to me about is childcare for the people and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=137.66s)]
*  She's the one that got it started and Marco Rubio helped a lot and a lot of the Republican senators [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=143.5s)]
*  We put in a great childcare and we'll be expanding that and that will help you a lot [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=149.45999999999998s)]
*  So, Mr. President, we got a young voter right here not not all the young people are voting for Kamala Harris [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=154.1s)]
*  But you have a concern about the media and cutting through the noise there. What is your question for the former president? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=159.34s)]
*  Hello, President Trump. I'm just curious on how you're gonna combat the all the fake news and break through some of the noise to get the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=165.82s)]
*  Undecided voters to vote for you this November [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=172.66s)]
*  Well, what are you gonna do? It's a great question because [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  You really do it by doing a show like this with Lawrence and the group [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=179.86s)]
*  You have to get your word out and you don't have a fair media. You have a very liberal biased media [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=187.10000000000002s)]
*  I have no idea why I actually have no idea think of it. They don't want walls. They don't want borders [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=192.32s)]
*  They don't want good economies. They the things they want are destructive to our country [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=198.88s)]
*  But I will tell you that it's very important if you're doing what I'm doing you have to do shows like this [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=205.0s)]
*  That's another thing Kamala doesn't do any shows. She doesn't do interviews. She doesn't talk to people [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=210.76s)]
*  She doesn't do anything like that and that's not fair to the public because they don't know what they're getting [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  But they saw last night what they had they had a rigged show with somebody that maybe even had the answers [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=221.5s)]
*  I mean, I'll be honest what I watched her talk and I said, you know [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=227.83999999999997s)]
*  She seems awfully familiar with the questions and you get pretty good at that stuff after a while [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=232.45999999999998s)]
*  but when I saw how how totally rigged that was I take a look at it and I watch and I say [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=237.22s)]
*  You know, you have to get out there and one of the things I did is I said let's do this show it [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=244.38s)]
*  like what time is it 630 in the morning and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=250.26s)]
*  It's an honor to do it, but you have to go out and you have to do the shows [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=254.14s)]
*  You have to go out and do media and some of the media is honest, it's not all dishonest [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=257.41999999999996s)]
*  That's the good news, but much of it is that say it close to 80% and I mean seriously dishonest [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=262.82s)]
*  So mr. President the final question we're in, Pennsylvania [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=269.97999999999996s)]
*  We cannot let this interview end without talking about fracking and there's a lot of people [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=272.78s)]
*  Concerned about what happened under the base stage last night and that complex here's position wasn't fully prosecuted yesterday [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=278.09999999999997s)]
*  The people know that she flip-flopped on the issue. So how are you gonna make the case so you can win, Pennsylvania? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=286.04s)]
*  So I'm leading in Pennsylvania and just about all the polls and I'm leading by some in a lot [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=293.04s)]
*  And one of the issues is fracking I've been from fracking from it's like the day I was born always fracking [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=298.8s)]
*  She's always been against it and she's been against it strongly and if she won she would end fracking in Pennsylvania [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=305.40000000000003s)]
*  100% she would end it and that would be it all she's doing is she just changed her view just a very short time ago [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  She went. Oh, I'm totally in favor of fracking all of a sudden [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=321.47999999999996s)]
*  She is totally against that you have every clip and Sean Hannity plays them every night every clip [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=324.96s)]
*  She's against fracking all of a sudden. She's losing in the polls. She's not doing down her president is doing horribly [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=331.52s)]
*  How did he do in the debate at least she could speak but her president goes down they did a palace coup in the president [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=339.1s)]
*  She comes out and she does fracking [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=345.58s)]
*  So I say to the people of Pennsylvania, you know what you have with Trump and I'm with you [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=348.26s)]
*  I went to school in Pennsylvania have my friends in Pennsylvania and I'm a fracker and that's [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=352.38s)]
*  500,000 jobs in Pennsylvania and a lot of your income [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=358.7s)]
*  Pennsylvania would be devastated if they take that away. She will obviously take that away [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=362.58s)]
*  Oh, she'll take away drilling in Texas [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  She's gonna take away they ended Anwar the biggest oil site in the world that Ronald Reagan couldn't get in Alaska [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=369.7s)]
*  They ended it. I got it approved and they ended it and nobody can believe they did [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=377.3s)]
*  We had the biggest site in the world. They ended it in the first week in office [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=382.66s)]
*  Think of that they cut the Keystone pipeline. They will end fracking Keystone pipeline [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=387.54s)]
*  One of the biggest pipelines in the world they ended it in the first day or the first week that he was in office [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  They will end fracking because she's not a fracker and they'll also take away your guns. They will confiscate your guns [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=400.44s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you so much to talking to the folks here in Pennsylvania at the diner [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=409.32s)]
*  I'll send it back to the couch because I know you have a prior commitment to go visit the heroes at 9-eleven [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  Memorial [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHv7dF5Ipco&t=418.04s)]
