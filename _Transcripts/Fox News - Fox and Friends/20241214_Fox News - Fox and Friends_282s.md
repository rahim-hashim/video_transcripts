# Trump has installed a kind of new patriotism in this country: Economist
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0)
*  It's morning in America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=0.0s)]
*  Again, President-elect Donald Trump ringing the bell this week at the New York Stock Exchange [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=15.24s)]
*  as loud chants of USA echo on Wall Street. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=19.66s)]
*  But will this optimism make its way to mainstream? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=22.56s)]
*  and co-author of the Trump Economic Miracle, Stephen Moore joins us now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=26.92s)]
*  Stephen, great to see you this morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=31.12s)]
*  Let's start with some context. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  That's the first time since 1985 that a president or would-be president has visited the New [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=34.56s)]
*  York Stock Exchange. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=40.72s)]
*  Ronald Reagan was the last time. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=41.88s)]
*  That's why we've mentioned several times this morning, morning in America again. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  What do you make of the significance of Trump ringing the bell on Wall Street? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, I just can't stop smiling. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=52.24s)]
*  And I see that because it was the most amazing moment when all these traders on the floor [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=55.44s)]
*  of the New York Stock Exchange started chanting USA, USA. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=60.48s)]
*  You know, it's so interesting because remember Kamala Harris when she was running said she [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  was going to bring joy back to America. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  I guess by losing she has brought joy because Trump has, I mean, this is the Trump effect [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=70.12s)]
*  right now, Will, where people everywhere I go, people are confident, they're optimistic, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=75.12s)]
*  they have a little more of a hop in their step. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=80.32s)]
*  That's true even, Will, of Democrats. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=84.36000000000001s)]
*  Many of my Democrat friends say, hey, you know, this guy's going to bring back the American [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=86.12s)]
*  economy. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=89.72000000000001s)]
*  So it's a very positive thing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=90.72000000000001s)]
*  And the other interesting development is it's almost like Donald Trump is always already [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=93.64000000000001s)]
*  president, isn't it? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=99.44000000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, what's the saying about Joe Biden that he's forgotten but not [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=100.44000000000001s)]
*  gone? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  And Trump has essentially assumed the role of president two months early. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=106.72s)]
*  But it's great for America. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  People are really feeling upbeat. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=114.0s)]
*  By the way, confidence is good for the economy because it means people go out and spend. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  They invest. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=120.48s)]
*  So I'm upbeat and I think most Americans are. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=121.48s)]
*  I want to pick up on that confidence thing because this could be seen or could be misunderstood [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  as like a cheerleading moment. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=127.48s)]
*  You know, the whole crowd yelling USA, USA. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=129.88s)]
*  And Stephen, I'm not here to preach to you only to set you up. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=133.96s)]
*  You're the economist. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=136.16s)]
*  You know, an economy is only a series, millions of decisions and choices made by individual [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=137.6s)]
*  consumers on a daily or actually on an hourly basis. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=143.52s)]
*  And there's a thing called animal instincts, right? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=147.04s)]
*  And that is like, how do you feel your animal instinct about your purchasing power and what [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  you feel about tomorrow? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=153.48s)]
*  If you listen to traders on the floor of the stock exchange yelling USA, USA, what that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=155.24s)]
*  suggests is we're on the verge of animal instincts carrying us forward in a positive direction. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=160.24s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=167.32s)]
*  I mean, there's people are just feeling like good things are coming with the Trump economic [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=168.32s)]
*  agenda. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=173.84s)]
*  You know, I'm proud of that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=174.84s)]
*  I helped with the agenda in that first term. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=175.92s)]
*  But I think people look back at those four years when Trump was president and say, hey, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=178.84s)]
*  that was maybe I didn't like this or that about Trump, but they were prosperous years [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=183.24s)]
*  for the country. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  I think you're going to see Trump well, right out of the gate, literally on January 21st, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  signing executive orders, promoting American energy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=194.32s)]
*  We're going to get that tax cut done. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  All of these things are good for America. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=198.6s)]
*  One other quick point. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=201.04s)]
*  You know, Trump has also instilled a kind of new patriotism in this country. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=202.04s)]
*  I mean, people feel really upbeat about our country and foreigners are. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=206.6s)]
*  By the way, why do you think you see so much foreign money coming into the United States? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=210.88s)]
*  Because even foreigners are looking at what's happening here and say, hey, good things are [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=214.92s)]
*  coming to America. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=218.45999999999998s)]
*  It's kind of amazing that one man, Donald Trump, could totally change the mood of the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=219.88s)]
*  country. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=224.64s)]
*  And we were just showing videos, you were talking of that trader in his blue jacket, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  giving Trump a blue jacket. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=229.11999999999998s)]
*  The audio from that moment is him saying, hey, if there's a guy, you're the guy. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=230.6s)]
*  That's what that trader is saying to Trump. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=234.83999999999997s)]
*  You're the guy for this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=236.32s)]
*  Certainly a positive feeling. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  I heard it this week, Stephen, I was in Alabama. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=239.48s)]
*  I heard this several times. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=241.72s)]
*  My son, who's an airline pilot, would be airline pilot, he was put on hold, put on hold. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=242.72s)]
*  The day after the election gets a call, OK, we're ready to hire. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  You're just starting to hear that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  We're ready to hire. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=251.2s)]
*  We're ready for the economy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=252.2s)]
*  Stephen, so I got to leave it there. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=253.2s)]
*  That's why I called this book The Trump Economic Miracle, because this guy brings miracles [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=254.92s)]
*  to the country. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=260.04s)]
*  So we're going to see how this… [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=261.04s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  And I think it's going to happen quickly, by the way. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  First day in office. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  All right, The Trump Economic Miracle, there it is on your screen. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfin0kPASG0&t=265.71999999999997s)]
