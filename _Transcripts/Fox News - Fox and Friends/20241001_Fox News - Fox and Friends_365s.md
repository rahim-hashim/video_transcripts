# Hezbollah targets Israel's Mossad headquarters with rocket fire
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls)
*  We have got a Fox News alert for you because right now Israeli troops are moving deeper [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=0.0s)]
*  into southern Lebanon after beginning their overnight invasion on the ground. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=5.92s)]
*  Nate Foy joins us right now from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=11.28s)]
*  Nate. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=13.64s)]
*  Hey Steve, good morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=14.64s)]
*  So Israel is complimenting its limited ground offensive with additional airstrikes across [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=16.96s)]
*  Lebanon this morning while Hezbollah is responding with a constant wave of rockets into northern [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=21.56s)]
*  and central Israel including here in Tel Aviv where Hezbollah targeted the Mossad headquarters [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=27.56s)]
*  with several rockets fired from a civilian area in Lebanon. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=33.56s)]
*  Some but not all of them were shot down. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=37.36s)]
*  Take a look at the damage. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=39.4s)]
*  We're learning of two injuries, both of them drivers hit by falling shrapnel. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=40.4s)]
*  This is the second time in a week that Hezbollah has targeted Tel Aviv. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=45.2s)]
*  The Houthis targeted Tel Aviv twice as well in the past week, so four times overall. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Take a look here at Israeli forces getting ready to invade southern Lebanon overnight. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=53.52s)]
*  Their commandos and paratroopers are focused on Hezbollah positions up against the border [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=57.72s)]
*  so the evacuated residents of Israel's north can return to their homes. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=62.28s)]
*  Israel continues taking out Hezbollah's weapons capabilities as well. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=67.12s)]
*  They hit several facilities in the Dahya neighborhood of Beirut this morning. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  Don't forget Israel is still fighting Hamas in Gaza. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=75.44s)]
*  Overnight Israeli airstrikes reportedly killed at least 31 people. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=78.84s)]
*  In one of them, Israel says they hit a Hamas command center that was inside a building [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=82.56s)]
*  that used to be a school. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=87.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, Yemen's Houthi rebels appear to have resumed their attacks on shipping in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  the Red Sea after Israel hit Yemen's port city of Hedda on Sunday. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  The Houthis also claim they shot down a U.S. drone on Monday. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=97.72s)]
*  As for what we can expect in this limited ground invasion, a senior U.S. official tells [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=101.92s)]
*  smaller and quicker than the 2006 second Lebanon war that lasted 34 days and ended in a U.N. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=107.5s)]
*  resolution requiring that Hezbollah operate north of the Latani River, which is something [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=114.98s)]
*  that didn't actually happen in practice. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=119.98s)]
*  And that's why the 60,000 residents up in Israel's north had to evacuate when Hezbollah [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=122.18s)]
*  began firing on Israel on October 8th. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=127.06s)]
*  Brian? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=129.82s)]
*  Wow, Nate, so many moving parts. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=130.82s)]
*  Great job. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=132.14s)]
*  28 minutes now before the top of the hour. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=133.14s)]
*  Let's expand on the conversation. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=134.9s)]
*  Thank you, Brian. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=137.18s)]
*  I think that Hezbollah has been busy over the last 17, 18 years digging tunnels and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=138.18s)]
*  preparing for this day. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=142.26s)]
*  And what exists just in the last few months is the fact that Hezbollah has been able to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=144.1s)]
*  do so much more. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=148.94s)]
*  And I think that the U.S. is going to be able to do that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=149.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=152.94s)]
*  Thank you, Brian. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=153.94s)]
*  And I think that Hezbollah is going to be able to do that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=154.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=155.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=156.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=157.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=158.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=159.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=160.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=161.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=162.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=163.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=164.94s)]
*  The next just on the other side of the blue line, the border between Israel and Lebanon, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=166.54s)]
*  is an intricate system of tunnels that Hezbollah has dug, which they intend to use in order [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=170.62s)]
*  to cross into Israel and attack Israeli communities. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=176.46s)]
*  And that will be one very important point of infrastructure that Israeli troops will [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=179.82s)]
*  be going in in order to dismantle so that the area will be safe for Israeli civilians [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  to return to once the military operations hopefully will come to a successful conclusion. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=189.94s)]
*  Between the 3,000 plus leaders, Hezbollah fighters that were blown up with their pagers [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=196.89999999999998s)]
*  in walkie talkies, between the leadership that was blown up between Nasrallah's death, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  what is the level of disarray among the world's leading terrorist organization right now? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=205.98s)]
*  Ten being total disarray, one being no big deal. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=212.04s)]
*  I would put that at a four, maybe a five. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=217.0s)]
*  We're talking about a serious terrorist organization of battle-hardened war criminals. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=221.88s)]
*  They fought and conducted lots of war crimes in Syria at the behest of Bashar al-Assad, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  and they've been fighting in Lebanon. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=233.36s)]
*  They have experienced fighting against Israel. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=234.68s)]
*  So despite the fact that a lot of the senior leadership of Hezbollah has been decimated, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=236.6s)]
*  they're still rank and file and junior and mid-level leadership. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=243.08s)]
*  And I think that they are battle-ready and they want to fight. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=247.4s)]
*  And that's what the IDF is going in to deal with. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=250.12s)]
*  Colonel, The Wall Street Journal tells a story today that the U.S. better get aboard. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=252.32s)]
*  We have an opportunity now to neutralize the Houthi rebels as well as Iran. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  Here's the headline. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=261.12s)]
*  How to exploit Israel's success. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=262.44s)]
*  With Hezbollah weak and Iran worried, now is the time for the U.S. to add pressure. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=264.22s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=268.88s)]
*  How would you do it? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=270.22s)]
*  Well I think that Israel is fighting a war for the West, on behalf of the West, many [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=273.32s)]
*  times an ungrateful war where Israel isn't getting the support that it really needs and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=279.28s)]
*  many times gets far more criticism than it should in the West, not necessarily in the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  U.S. but in many other countries. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=289.67999999999995s)]
*  What I think Israel is doing is trailblazing and showing the world that yes, you can fight, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=291.55999999999995s)]
*  you can stand up against militant Islamism, and yes, you can stand up against Iran and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=297.32s)]
*  their terrorist organizations. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=303.08s)]
*  I think that it's very good that we're talking about the Islamic Republic of Iran because [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=304.58s)]
*  they are the source of violence and instability. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=310.26s)]
*  They are the ones that are threatening U.S. troops in the Middle East. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=313.18s)]
*  They are the ones who are attacking Israeli civilians day and night. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=316.09999999999997s)]
*  I think that in the not so distant future, that is where Israeli focus will go. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=320.3s)]
*  We have some other fish to fry to deal with first, Hamas and Hezbollah, but the day isn't [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=325.68s)]
*  far when we will turn our focus on Iran and deal with the source of violence and instability [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=331.18s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=338.62s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel, everyone's pretty much in awe of what Israel has done. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=339.62s)]
*  Walter Russell Mead of the Wall Street Journal says, Prime Minister Netanyahu has had the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=343.98s)]
*  greatest week in maybe modern political history and military history too. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=347.18s)]
*  Thanks so much, Colonel. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=352.38s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=353.38s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=354.38s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=355.38s)]
*  And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls&t=356.38s)]
