# Fellow vet questions Tim Walz's military service
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk)
*  Meanwhile, her running mate, Tim Walz, the governor, is defending his military service [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=0.0s)]
*  out on the campaign trail amid accusations of embellishing his title and dodging deployment. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=5.78s)]
*  When Walz was running for governor back in 2018, two Minnesota National Guard vets, including [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=12.58s)]
*  our next guest, wrote a letter against Walz to a local paper saying, quote, when the nation [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=17.32s)]
*  called, he quit. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=23.42s)]
*  He failed his country. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=25.34s)]
*  He failed his state. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=26.62s)]
*  He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard and his fellow soldiers. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=27.76s)]
*  So right now, retired command sergeant Major Paul Herr joins us right now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  Paul, good morning to you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  Good morning, Steve. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=41.22s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=42.22s)]
*  I'm doing OK. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=43.22s)]
*  You know, a lot of people are talking about this, JD Vance compared it to Stolen Valor. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=44.22s)]
*  You made the initial allegation back in 2018. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=48.82s)]
*  So the story's been out there for a while. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=51.660000000000004s)]
*  What about what he has said is wrong? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=54.56s)]
*  Well, he continually claims that he's a retired sergeant major. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=59.24s)]
*  He's not. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=65.72s)]
*  He's a retired master sergeant. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=66.72s)]
*  He continued, you know, when the deployment first came up, we started having meetings [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=67.72s)]
*  as command sergeant majors and operations sergeant majors to collectively get our training [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=74.2s)]
*  because we were, you know, that's part of what we do as sergeant majors is being subject [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=82.0s)]
*  matter experts in our fields and also responsible for the training of the soldiers to carry [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=88.6s)]
*  out the orders of the officers appointed over us to go into battle. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=95.24s)]
*  That's a pretty high priority for us. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=100.4s)]
*  And he consistently, we were aware of his campaign bid in some order of fashion, being [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  that it was his first one. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=109.68s)]
*  And he consistently told us as fellow sergeant majors at the time that he was going to, you [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=111.28s)]
*  know, go on the deployment. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=117.48s)]
*  You could, as I remember him saying, you can count on us. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=119.32s)]
*  And at the same time, having backroom conversations with other people, other entities inside the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=124.36s)]
*  Minnesota National Guard to ensure that he could retire. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=131.76s)]
*  He subverted the chain of command. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=136.12s)]
*  He went around the chain of command. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=137.76s)]
*  The brigade sergeant major had no clue. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=139.44s)]
*  These are all important facts. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=143.16s)]
*  And he did it to continually feather his own bed. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=146.0s)]
*  That was the shameful part of it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=149.68s)]
*  And then, of course, he never entered into the sergeant majors academy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  He never did one scrap of work. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=156.24s)]
*  It takes years. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=158.16s)]
*  He signed a commitment letter saying that he was going to do that job. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=159.68s)]
*  He didn't. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=163.36s)]
*  And he was stripped of that title when he left the Minnesota National Guard. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=165.36s)]
*  Yet, he still claims to do it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=169.44000000000003s)]
*  We did get the Minnesota National Guard did put out a statement ever since this brouhaha. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  And it says, among other things, Governor Tim Walz served from, and there's the dates, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=176.96s)]
*  he held multiple positions within field artillery. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=181.52s)]
*  It goes on to say, and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  the battalion. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  He retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=190.88s)]
*  additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeant's Major Academy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=198.96s)]
*  What do you think about that statement, Paul? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=204.36s)]
*  Well, everybody has to understand, too, that you don't bite the hand that feeds you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=207.04s)]
*  So they concocted that there's a veryâ€”you know, it was a very political answer. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  It was a political answer. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  He is a sergeant major. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=223.48s)]
*  And it wasn't because he didn'tâ€”you know, it wasn't for benefit purposes. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=225.28s)]
*  That was theâ€”you know, unfortunately, he didn't complete the coursework because he [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=230.84s)]
*  never entered into it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  It's misleading. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=236.24s)]
*  You know, it sounds like he missed the last test or something. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=237.24s)]
*  He didn't do that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=240.28s)]
*  He didn't do anything. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=241.28s)]
*  He did it all under the guise that he was going to get something. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=243.48s)]
*  Remember, we were paying him to do something all along. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=246.24s)]
*  He was not going to do it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=249.56s)]
*  It's kind of like if you're in a small town and you have a volunteer fire department and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=251.04s)]
*  you pay to train them and they work hard and they train, but they never have to fight a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=256.0s)]
*  fire, then you have a fire at your house or the nation has a calling that you need to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=260.28s)]
*  go and put your life at risk for. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=267.2s)]
*  And you as a volunteer fire department say, yeah, I don't thinkâ€”I think I'm quitting today. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=269.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=273.76s)]
*  I think I'm going to take a pass on that one, call somebody else. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=274.76s)]
*  Well, you know, a lot of people are talking about it, and it's great to hear from you, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=276.88s)]
*  Paul, as one of the people who put that allegation out there six years ago. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=280.2s)]
*  So thank you very much for telling us your story. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=284.55999999999995s)]
*  Well, thank you, Steve. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=288.11999999999995s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=289.11999999999995s)]
*  Have a good day. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=290.11999999999995s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=291.11999999999995s)]
*  And thanks for your service, by the way. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIWdKh8Kowk&t=292.11999999999995s)]
