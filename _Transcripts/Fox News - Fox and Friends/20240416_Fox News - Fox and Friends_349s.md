# Biden is systematically moving us toward WWIII: Retired Navy SEAL
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY)
*  Alive here in New York City, let's bring in Mike Sreli at Retired Navy Seal, host of Everyday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=0.0s)]
*  Warrior podcast and co-founder of Legacy Expeditions. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=4.9s)]
*  Mike, good morning to you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=7.98s)]
*  Thanks for coming in. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=9.46s)]
*  So as we just saw, Israel is getting ready to do something. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=11.34s)]
*  But at the same time, we heard from the White House on Sunday that we, the United States, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=15.24s)]
*  will not support anything that Israel does to counterattack them. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=20.18s)]
*  So it sounds like, are they on their own? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=25.52s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=28.38s)]
*  Netanyahu probably gets off the phone with Biden and says one word, feckless. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=29.56s)]
*  They are, they probably lost 100% confidence in the U.S. right now, knowing that potentially [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=33.8s)]
*  there's a reset with Trump. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=38.08s)]
*  Israel has always been prepared to go alone. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=40.24s)]
*  And there's really two sort of scenarios here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=42.6s)]
*  There's the direct attack, which would most likely be against the Natanz or Isfahan nuclear [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=44.72s)]
*  facilities. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=51.16s)]
*  But Natanz is so far down in the ground, no bunker buster can reach it, which would require [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=52.16s)]
*  ground troops after that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=58.82s)]
*  Most likely is the indirect approach, fifth generation warfare through subterfuge, which [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=60.38s)]
*  is cyber to shut down their comms grid, their energy grid, to make the dissidents rise up. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=65.34s)]
*  Israel knows this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=71.22s)]
*  The Ayatollah and this religious theocracy is on its last breath. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=72.22s)]
*  And Iran only exists because of the two wild cards in this, and that is Russia and China. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=77.58s)]
*  I also saw the militants took over to a military facility like last week. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=82.54s)]
*  They're rising up within Iran, which is so insane that we're protesting for Iran in America. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=86.46s)]
*  And yet in Iran, they hate their government. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=92.16s)]
*  But I understand the IRGC has made it clear. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=94.61999999999999s)]
*  If you attack us back, we're going to attack you again from your soil, from our soil. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  So it shows you the game has changed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=103.02s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what, the protests, one, I assure you they weren't paying taxes yesterday. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=104.44s)]
*  My best advice to them is get a job and be a net positive on society. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=108.44s)]
*  I think it's a sad commentary on society that we're struggling with moral confusion and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=112.2s)]
*  social deviancy fueled by low expectations. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=116.36s)]
*  And the fact that there is this intellectual arrogance amongst a lot of American people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  that, you know, they see the world through rose-colored glasses. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=125.08s)]
*  We've been so safe for so long, it's become entitlement. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  But the biggest flawed notion is that foreign wars stay foreign. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=132.46s)]
*  This is the closest we've been to World War III since the Cuban Missile Crisis. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=137.06s)]
*  And there's intel, and this goes to the open border, that IRGC, PLA, ISIS, al-Qaeda, IRGC, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=141.62s)]
*  all have cells here. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  This is disintegration warfare being led by China and its allies. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=151.38s)]
*  Chris Wray has warned about that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=155.0s)]
*  He said in his entire career at the FBI, he has never seen the threats, this many threats [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=156.12s)]
*  all at once. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=161.12s)]
*  What was your reaction when you saw them carrying the Hezbollah flags, protesters here in America, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=162.12s)]
*  burning the American flag, chanting, death to America? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=166.16s)]
*  It's disheartening knowing that my generation went to war for 20 years. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=170.12s)]
*  But you know, Ainsley, I say you can't cure stupid. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=173.74s)]
*  You just can't. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=176.74s)]
*  And the good people need to really affect this great reset in the 2024 elections. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=177.74s)]
*  We can't afford any more of this poor performance. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=183.82s)]
*  Mike, do you worry about the state of the country when you look at the military recruitment [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=186.74s)]
*  is down? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=191.3s)]
*  You got kids that I speak to on the street, they don't remember 9-11. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=192.3s)]
*  Some of them weren't even born. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=197.1s)]
*  They don't understand. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=198.3s)]
*  I mean, I saw these protesters with this flag in Lower Manhattan where the towers fell. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  I just felt like that was untouchable at one point in time. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=205.96s)]
*  Is there some anguish in your heart as someone that went and fought the war and then you [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  come back home and people don't even respect that? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=215.70000000000002s)]
*  If the next generation doesn't feel pride in our country, that's because we have failed [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=218.4s)]
*  them to set the example for them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  And quite frankly, you know, I've got a daughter on the way. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=224.72000000000003s)]
*  We just found out. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=228.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=229.66s)]
*  And it's almost like a wake-up call for me that, you know, when you come back from 20 [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=230.66s)]
*  years of war, you just sort of want to be left alone and build a business. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=234.42s)]
*  That's what I focused on. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=237.62s)]
*  And if you don't take an interest in politics, politics will assuredly take an interest in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=238.62s)]
*  you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=242.38s)]
*  And so this baby is now making me wake up that I need to get involved. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=243.38s)]
*  I need to affect what I can, whether on the local level, the regional level or the national [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=247.14s)]
*  level. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=251.14s)]
*  But on what planet are we all of a sudden on Iran's side? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=252.14s)]
*  I mean, since 1979, they have been an enemy of America, death to America. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=255.52s)]
*  They wrote that phrase. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=259.92s)]
*  And now we're protesting for Iran, a people that just, the Ayatollahs, they just personify [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=261.52s)]
*  intolerance. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=268.04s)]
*  Everything that these people say they want, they want gender confusion, they want to be [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=270.4s)]
*  able to talk about equality and all these things. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=276.44s)]
*  Iran represents none of those things. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=280.44s)]
*  Iran's represent none of those things. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=282.96s)]
*  It's this deviancy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=285.53999999999996s)]
*  The fact that Israel has become the deviant after October 7th. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=286.68s)]
*  The democracy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=290.02s)]
*  It's insane to me. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=291.02s)]
*  You know, I'll say this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=292.38s)]
*  Iran has been our enemy since 1979. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=294.78s)]
*  The fact that this administration gave billions to them is akin to giving... [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=297.06s)]
*  It continues to do it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=301.02s)]
*  It continues. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=302.02s)]
*  It's like giving money to Antifa. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=303.02s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=305.5s)]
*  In this administration, I swear to God, I would love to sit in one of their national [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=306.91999999999996s)]
*  security meetings. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=309.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=310.65999999999997s)]
*  Because it's like an episode of Veep. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  I think they sit around and say, what's the worst idea we can come up with? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=313.36s)]
*  Let's go with that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=315.32000000000005s)]
*  It's shocking. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  Don't vote on politics. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=318.12s)]
*  Vote on performance for this election because we can't sustain it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=319.58000000000004s)]
*  This administration is systematically moving us towards World War III. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=322.56s)]
*  Well, congratulations on the baby. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=325.6s)]
*  Thank you, ma'am. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=327.72s)]
*  Sounds like you might, we're hinting around that you might run for office. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=328.72s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  There's other ways. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  No? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  You think you're going to get more involved? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=334.20000000000005s)]
*  Much like Israel, the indirect route. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  Okay, well, thank you for your service. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=336.20000000000005s)]
*  Thanks, Mike. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYKBHvz9GmY&t=337.20000000000005s)]
