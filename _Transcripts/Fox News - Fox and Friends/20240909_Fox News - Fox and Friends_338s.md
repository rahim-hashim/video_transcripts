# Bernie Sanders is absolutely 'destroying' Kamala Harris' campaign: Charlie Hurt
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0)
*  We are just one day away from the ABC 2024 presidential debate, and Trump is aiming to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=0.0s)]
*  define Kamala Harris's far-left record. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=5.36s)]
*  This as 28% of likely voters say when it comes to Harris, they need to learn more compared [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=8.94s)]
*  to just 9% for Donald Trump. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=15.06s)]
*  Here with to help set all of this up, set up the stage, Fox News contributors Tammy [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=17.7s)]
*  Bruce and Charlie Hurt. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=21.96s)]
*  Good morning to both of you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=23.2s)]
*  Hi there. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=24.2s)]
*  Hi. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=25.2s)]
*  Okay, Tammy, I'll start. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=26.2s)]
*  Good morning, Charlie. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=27.2s)]
*  Tammy, I'll start with you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=28.2s)]
*  What does Donald Trump need to do to focus really on her background, her policies, because [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=29.2s)]
*  clearly one-third of the American voters don't know what she stands for? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=34.28s)]
*  Yes, and I think that's key. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=38.0s)]
*  And this is why you suddenly saw Kamala Harris put up some positions, which frankly also [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  look like word salads on her website. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=43.54s)]
*  But he needs to focus on, as everyone is saying, and he understands the issues. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=46.92s)]
*  That's why he's running. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  He's running because of the issues. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  But I think that it's key, because this is also about transparency. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=55.2s)]
*  What is her problem with not doing interviews, with not speaking about the issues? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=58.86s)]
*  And like, as an example, with immigration, on her website, it's the same kind of word [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=63.300000000000004s)]
*  salad and claiming that the border is—there's fewer people coming over. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=68.78s)]
*  And then she recommends amnesty, right, a path to citizenship. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=73.8s)]
*  So it's the same thing people have heard. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=77.5s)]
*  It's nothing new. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=79.94s)]
*  And I think that he needs—and this is key—to remind people to what—you can just look [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=81.44s)]
*  at what people have done, not what they say. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=86.72s)]
*  And he has a history, she has one. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=89.56s)]
*  And the problem for her is she's running from hers, and he is running toward his. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=91.74s)]
*  It's an easier position to be in. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=97.52s)]
*  So it's about where he stands on the issues. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=99.4s)]
*  What is he going to accomplish? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=101.64s)]
*  She is not going to be able to compete with that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=103.6s)]
*  Charlie, here are some of the flip-flops that she's going to have to address. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=105.4s)]
*  She originally said she wanted to ban fracking, said that for years. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  Medicare for all, including illegals, a border wall funding, decriminalization for [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=112.36s)]
*  everyone who crosses the border, and federal jobs guarantee. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=118.88s)]
*  That was part of the Green New Deal. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  How does she—how does she pivot from these positions, and how does she explain that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=124.0s)]
*  to the American people? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=127.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's going to be really difficult, and I agree with Tammy, that it is going to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=129.2s)]
*  end up coming down to credibility. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=134.4s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump is probably the greatest political debater we've ever had in American [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  history. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=140.64s)]
*  He went through the 2016 primary and knocked out 18 Republicans. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=141.72s)]
*  He managed to knock out a sitting president out of the race before the first ballot was [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=147.72s)]
*  cast in a debate. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=154.54s)]
*  But I think that what will be sort of surprising to people is I think that Kamala Harris will [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=157.06s)]
*  end up actually doing better than people are anticipating, because there's been so much [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=161.74s)]
*  hype about how bad she is with her word salads. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=166.68s)]
*  The problem is that she will appear to do better during the debate. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=170.8s)]
*  But the problem is that you're going to take whatever she says during the debate and compare [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=176.84s)]
*  it to all of those platforms that you just listed that she's already flipped on, and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=181.04s)]
*  compare the tape from tomorrow night to all the other things that she's said in the past. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=186.84s)]
*  And the problem with that is not only does it suggest that she has no idea where she [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=193.24s)]
*  is on the issues, the problem is that it reveals her willingness to say anything she [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=197.58s)]
*  has to say to get elected. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=203.66000000000003s)]
*  And that goes to the heart of credibility. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=205.74s)]
*  And nothing defines a politician like credibility, either losing it or having it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=207.74s)]
*  And Trump has the credibility, and she does not. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=213.74s)]
*  You're right about it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=217.54000000000002s)]
*  I mean, he's not, he ran the first time, I'm not a politician, and people like that because [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  he's genuine. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=222.86s)]
*  We know where he stands. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=223.86s)]
*  A typical politician flip-flops, right, when they realize the American public doesn't like [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=225.42s)]
*  your old policies. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=229.66s)]
*  All right, here's Bernie Sanders, this was over the weekend, and he was saying, no, she [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=230.66s)]
*  has not changed, she's still a progressive, she's just doing this to win. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=235.14s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  I don't think she's abandoning her ideals. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=240.57999999999998s)]
*  I think she's trying to be pragmatic and doing what she thinks is right in order to win the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=243.89999999999998s)]
*  election. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=249.18s)]
*  Her views are not mine, but I do consider her progressive. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=250.18s)]
*  All right, Tammy, your reaction. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=252.82s)]
*  Yes, well, he used the word ideals, she used the word values. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=254.78s)]
*  And when she used that word values in that interview that she did for 16 minutes, that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=258.78s)]
*  was a wink and a nod to the left flank that was what I just said. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=263.53999999999996s)]
*  Don't listen to what I say, watch what I do. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=268.26s)]
*  We were also told by this team that they were going to be the unitors, that they were going [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=270.91999999999996s)]
*  to bring things back to normal. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=275.21999999999997s)]
*  Their normal is chaos. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=277.41999999999996s)]
*  Their normal is a bad economy. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=279.3s)]
*  Their normal is crime. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=281.08s)]
*  Their normal is an open border. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=282.58s)]
*  Their normal are world wars. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=284.54s)]
*  We've seen it now. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=286.78s)]
*  And they are making the mistake of underestimating the American people. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=287.9s)]
*  And that's where this, that New York Times Santa poll indicates, is that the American [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=291.72s)]
*  people want change. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=296.3s)]
*  After all of this, they don't see her as the agent of change. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=298.5s)]
*  They see Trump as that person. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=301.62s)]
*  Okay, Charlie, quick reaction. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=303.02s)]
*  I love the way he says that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=306.26s)]
*  He said that like he was helping her out, and he's actually absolutely destroying her [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=307.78s)]
*  credibility as he says it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=312.18s)]
*  He's won from this. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=314.26s)]
*  You know, nobody has gained more from the Biden-Harris administration than radicals [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=316.02s)]
*  like Bernie Sanders. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=321.05999999999995s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=322.34s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=322.85999999999996s)]
*  I appreciate both of you all being here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=323.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=326.17999999999995s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebvbOQm5n0&t=326.82s)]
