# Homan fires back at ABC host: 'Where was Laken Riley's due process?'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34)
*  Hi, today a federal appeals court will hear arguments on whether Donald Trump and his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=0.0s)]
*  administration can continue deportation fights for suspected migrant gang members living [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=5.62s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=11.24s)]
*  We're going up the court system again. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=12.24s)]
*  Madeline Rivera joins us from Washington, D.C. with the details. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Good morning, Maddie. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=17.12s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=18.12s)]
*  Yeah, the Trump administration is defiant. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=19.12s)]
*  They say they have the authority to deport migrants whom they say are national security [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=21.02s)]
*  threats. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  They are expected to double down on that argument today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  This comes as the administration standoff with federal judge James Boesberg escalates. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=29.88s)]
*  Boesberg calls the president's expanded use of the Alien Enemies Act problematic, and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=34.76s)]
*  he's also promising to find out whether the administration flouted his order to turn deportation [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=39.32s)]
*  flights to El Salvador back around. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=44.4s)]
*  Borders R. Tom Homan says the administration will not defy court orders. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=46.84s)]
*  However, Homan is also taking aim at Boesberg. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=50.96s)]
*  I don't care about that, judges. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=54.04s)]
*  As far as this case, we're going to continue to arrest public safety threats and national [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=56.44s)]
*  security threats. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  We're going to continue to deport them from the United States. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  As far as events in one of those flight, every single one, according to the information given [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=64.36s)]
*  to me from the field, are members of the TDA. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=68.28s)]
*  And TDA has been determined to be terrorist organizations. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=71.6s)]
*  They are not classified as terrorists, so that plane removed 240 terrorists from the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=76.2s)]
*  United States. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=81.0s)]
*  As the case is litigated, deportation flights to Venezuela are back on after the country's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=82.6s)]
*  president, Nicolas Maduro, halted flights earlier this month. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=87.32s)]
*  Venezuelan officials say a deal with the U.S. had been reached. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=91.64s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security says the first flight arrived on Sunday. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  It had 199 people, including some whom the administration says are suspected gang members. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=98.72s)]
*  And Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is planning to visit Central America this [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  week. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=108.92s)]
*  The visit will kick off on Wednesday with a tour of El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  Center. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=113.92s)]
*  A DHS spokesperson, Trisha McLaughlin, telling Fox News Digital that Noem and the president [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=114.92s)]
*  are sending a clear message for criminal aliens considering entering America illegally. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=120.2s)]
*  Don't even think about it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=125.84s)]
*  After Noem's prison visit, she will also meet with El Salvador's president. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=127.76s)]
*  Lawrence, Rachel and Brian. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=134.2s)]
*  Thanks, Maddie. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=135.2s)]
*  Maddie, is it clear to you? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=136.2s)]
*  I'll talk to you later. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=137.2s)]
*  Go ahead, man. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=138.2s)]
*  Is Maddie still there? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=139.48s)]
*  Yeah, I'm still here. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=141.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=142.48s)]
*  So Maddie, is it clear to you what we did to get the flights back on track to Venezuela? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=143.48s)]
*  You know, I didn't actually see details regarding the deal that Venezuelan officials say had [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=148.6s)]
*  been reached with the U.S. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=153.0s)]
*  There was a post on X regarding it, but it's in Spanish, so I'm hoping that I can get a [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  translation. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=159.32s)]
*  But I looked into this, Brian, and I actually didn't see details regarding how and the details [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=160.32s)]
*  of that deal. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, same with me. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  I think it's something to do with Chevron. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  I think that they want to keep up that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=167.28s)]
*  So that's what I assume. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=169.44s)]
*  But thank you very much. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=170.44s)]
*  That's exactly why it was called in the first place. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=171.44s)]
*  Maddie, you can send it to me. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=172.44s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=173.44s)]
*  I thought about it, Rachel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=174.44s)]
*  As soon as I said it, I was like, I know Rachel can do it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=175.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=178.44s)]
*  Thank you, Maddie. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=179.44s)]
*  Thanks, guys. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=180.44s)]
*  I watched all the Sunday shows yesterday, and I was just stunned. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=181.44s)]
*  They pretty much dedicated the full hours talking about the flights that went over, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=183.96s)]
*  except they weren't advocating for the American people who have been victimized by the legal [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  people that are trying to turn to Niagara or MS-13. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=194.72s)]
*  They talked about the one off that maybe should have their cases reviewed. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=198.11999999999998s)]
*  But obviously looking at this story, a grandmother was murdered. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=203.6s)]
*  And this guy right here, if you can just throw up his mug shot. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=207.42s)]
*  He was subject to deportation in 2023 under the Biden administration. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=211.2s)]
*  But he murdered a grandmother. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=215.32s)]
*  It was no cause to do this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=217.88s)]
*  Obviously, there's never a cause. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=219.76s)]
*  It was a random attack. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=221.44000000000003s)]
*  And he was going to get away with it before the Trump administration. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  And he's not the only one, Rachel. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  I got like three other different cases. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=228.4s)]
*  This was in my home state of Texas. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=230.84s)]
*  Look at these menaces to society. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  Driving drunk, committed manslaughter. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=235.24s)]
*  The kid was like 20-some year old, and his car was just parked on the side, and they [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=237.88000000000002s)]
*  hit him and killed him. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=243.8s)]
*  These are the people that you should be talking about on your Sunday shows instead of the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  criminals. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=249.36s)]
*  So it's interesting to see what the families who are involved in pushing back and suing, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=250.44000000000003s)]
*  they're saying, my family member is not in Tren de Agua. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=255.72000000000003s)]
*  My family member is not MS-13. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=259.44s)]
*  That tattoo you see, one of them said is Real Madrid. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  It's the soccer team. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=265.72s)]
*  They're not in a gang. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  Don't send them to El Salvador. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=269.16s)]
*  But all these people could have self-deported. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  They saw what was going to happen. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=272.68s)]
*  Now listen, if you came here illegally and you were just going to be an illegal Uber [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=276.08s)]
*  driver maybe, and you got sent to that prison, I understand. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=282.28s)]
*  This is a big deal. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=286.35999999999996s)]
*  But the point is, you're not supposed to be in the country, and that is the chance that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=287.76s)]
*  you're taking by being here, especially if you commit a crime. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=291.76s)]
*  And to me, if you're looking to do a balance show, you start off by saying border crossings [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=295.0s)]
*  are down 96%. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=298.52s)]
*  It's almost impossible to conceive or predict this type of success. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  Also, when you talk about what's happening with this El Salvador crime, you want to know [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=304.88000000000005s)]
*  about the 261 that were sent to El Salvador last weekend, suddenly they're first front [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=309.12s)]
*  and center. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=313.12s)]
*  Do you want to ask how they got here to begin with? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=314.12s)]
*  Do you want to ask how they infiltrated these cities, the damage they have done? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=316.56s)]
*  Have you thought about the balance of it? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=320.20000000000005s)]
*  And if someone's caught up there, they shouldn't be? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=321.68s)]
*  There's an interesting inquiry you could have there. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=324.32000000000005s)]
*  If there's a way to do this because we need to send more people to El Salvador. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=326.04s)]
*  I don't know about you, Rachel. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=330.44000000000005s)]
*  I love your contacts more than mine. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=331.44000000000005s)]
*  But I worry about once they get to Venezuela if they're going to come right back. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=333.32s)]
*  And when they go to El Salvador, I know they're not because they cleaned up their entire country [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=336.68s)]
*  by jailing all their gangsters. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=341.68s)]
*  So I look forward to seeing what Kristi Noem sees when she gets there. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=344.12s)]
*  But I do think that Tom Homan was questioned constantly about this. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=348.2s)]
*  They want Trump to say, I'm defying the courts. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=351.36s)]
*  They want Tom Homan who say, I'm defying the courts. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=355.6s)]
*  They're waiting for a Trump official so they could say, all hell is broken loose. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=358.72s)]
*  Democracy is breaking down. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=362.68s)]
*  But it hasn't happened. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=364.72s)]
*  They're going to go up the ladder all the way through. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=365.72s)]
*  So is what the judge asking that in order to send them to El Salvador, you have to have [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=368.52000000000004s)]
*  proof that they were in a gang? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  Or is breaking the law and entering our country not, that's not enough? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  What the president is saying under the act that you don't have to show, you don't have [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=383.6s)]
*  to do this due process. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  So you have a constitutional right that is actually, they are afforded to illegals in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=391.08000000000004s)]
*  this country. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=397.76000000000005s)]
*  We should revisit that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=398.76000000000005s)]
*  But then you have a competing act that is saying, hey, if someone is a part of a foreign [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=399.92s)]
*  terrorist organization, that you don't have to give them due process and they can be deported. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=405.68s)]
*  Now the agents that I talked to. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=410.16s)]
*  But they have to prove that they were actually in the debt of our MS-13. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=411.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=415.44s)]
*  And so what the agents are saying is, because you hear all these activists keep talking about [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  the tattoos. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=420.32000000000005s)]
*  We're not just talking about the tattoos. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=421.32000000000005s)]
*  That's just one of the elements. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  We sat on their house and part of the reason why we don't want to reveal some of this information [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=425.12s)]
*  is because some of the people that got the information are undercover. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  So if we start bringing out our sources and methods, we're going to burn our sources that [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=432.16s)]
*  are still within the organization. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  I think that's a great point with your law enforcement background especially. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=439.12s)]
*  But I also think it's not practical to think that we can do due process on 8 million people. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=442.68s)]
*  It's 22 million people here and minimum illegal already just in the last three administrations. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  And there were some people that got through with Trump's administration. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  If we're going to give every these guys a day in court and a lawyer, we can't do it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  They don't deserve it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=460.91999999999996s)]
*  Our system doesn't need to be double burdened. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=462.09999999999997s)]
*  And I would just love to see the same curiosity, anger, outrage about the millions that came [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=464.4s)]
*  here at our border. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=470.41999999999996s)]
*  You found the NGOs. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=471.76s)]
*  You couldn't get into the building. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=474.4s)]
*  But they were sent into Westchester small towns in Pennsylvania and they're unloaded [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=476.28s)]
*  and we don't know anything about them. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=481.35999999999996s)]
*  Where was Margaret Brennan and who's ever hosting Meet the Press today? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=483.56s)]
*  Where were they curious about what's going on? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=488.96s)]
*  How do we know who's landing in the middle of the night? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=492.0s)]
*  How do we know who's been put into our school systems then? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=493.84s)]
*  If you were at least outraged then, you'd have more credibility now. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=496.4s)]
*  But now you're concerned that this is a tattoo arrest. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=500.91999999999996s)]
*  It wasn't a tattoo arrest. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=504.9s)]
*  And as much as it pains me to say it, just because you're a professional soccer player, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=506.23999999999995s)]
*  it doesn't mean that you're a great person and weren't up to no good when you escaped [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=510.38s)]
*  and got across our border. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=514.6s)]
*  If you were that good, you could have been transferred to another team. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=516.16s)]
*  I don't care about that. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=519.64s)]
*  And the judges think as far as this case, we're going to continue to arrest public safety [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=521.92s)]
*  threats and national security threats. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  We're going to continue to deport them from the United States. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=527.92s)]
*  The Alien Enemies Act was actually a federal law. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=530.1999999999999s)]
*  It's a statute enacted by Congress and signed by a president. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=532.1999999999999s)]
*  Now that's under litigation. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=535.28s)]
*  But put that aside, we still have Title 8 authority to remove illegal aliens from the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=537.0799999999999s)]
*  United States. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=541.5999999999999s)]
*  Do they have any due process at all? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=542.5999999999999s)]
*  Look, due process. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=544.28s)]
*  What was Lake Errone's due process? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=546.48s)]
*  To point, Borders are Tom Holman vowing to continue deportations, never saying who's [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=551.28s)]
*  going to defy the court, by the way. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=556.0s)]
*  This ahead of a hearing today on the Trump administration's decision to send migrant [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=557.68s)]
*  gang members to a maximum security prison in El Salvador. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=561.56s)]
*  Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett joins us now. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=565.64s)]
*  Greg, looks like the, first off, we're moving to a different court on the freezing of the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=568.68s)]
*  But we're still in the lower court with the judge who wants to know more details about [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=576.96s)]
*  why those flights took off on Saturday, last Saturday. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=582.36s)]
*  So can you update us from how you see this going? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=586.2s)]
*  Well the district court judge, Brian, his name is Boasberg. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=590.6s)]
*  He set a court hearing for tomorrow, but the higher appellate court has a hearing today [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=594.4000000000001s)]
*  to decide whether to toss out the judge's temporary restraining order on these deportations. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=600.6800000000001s)]
*  So for now, the appellate court has jurisdiction, but it really depends on what they do today. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=607.32s)]
*  What's so troubling, I think, about Boasberg's restraining order is that he is defying the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=613.72s)]
*  Supreme Court, which reviewed Harry Truman's use of the Alien Enemies Act after World War [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=618.12s)]
*  II ended, and the high court said that not only is the act constitutional in the law [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=625.12s)]
*  of the land, it is not subject to judicial review by any judge. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=630.8s)]
*  So when a president invokes it, no judge, no court can ever intervene, not even the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=637.5600000000001s)]
*  Supreme Court, because Congress gave the president the exclusive power that is purely political [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=642.76s)]
*  to make decisions on national security and foreign policy. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=650.04s)]
*  Well, Boasberg is duty-bound, Brian, as a lower court judge to follow the ruling of [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=653.84s)]
*  the highest court, the Supreme Court, and butt out, and yet he is brazenly ignoring [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=659.36s)]
*  the Supreme Court precedent. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=665.4s)]
*  So Greg, what is the answer here? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=668.0s)]
*  The appellate court you were just telling me in the break is not necessarily going to [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=670.08s)]
*  be friendly to the Trump administration, so they'll keep, once both of them make a decision, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=674.12s)]
*  they'll keep moving up this entire case, right? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=678.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=681.84s)]
*  This is, again, strictly a TRO hearing today in the appellate court, temporary restraining [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=684.52s)]
*  order, although I suspect they may start talking about other things, like has this judge exceeded [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=690.84s)]
*  his authority on other grounds, which I think he has. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=699.6800000000001s)]
*  It's not a friendly court. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=704.5600000000001s)]
*  It's an uphill battle for the Department of Justice on behalf of President Trump. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=706.2s)]
*  So if they uphold the TRO, goes back to the trial court judge, we see what he does, and [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=711.64s)]
*  then on the merits, it'll be appealed by the Department of Justice, again, going to higher [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=716.88s)]
*  and higher courts. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=722.4399999999999s)]
*  Eventually, I think, to the U.S. Supreme Court, Brian. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=723.72s)]
*  So let's look at the bigger picture. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=727.12s)]
*  Nation, our injunction numbers are unbelievable. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=728.8s)]
*  If you look at the past presidents, we've got George W. Bush with six, Obama with 12, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  Biden with 14. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=736.88s)]
*  In their entire administrations, Trump, too, has got 15 already. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=738.44s)]
*  So is there something cooking in Congress to stop this trend and actually give an administration [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=742.6s)]
*  a chance to implement their policy? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=750.64s)]
*  There is, because Democrats and liberal groups have been sprinting to favorable venues and [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=754.44s)]
*  preferable judges, where the result is preordained in their favor against Trump. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=761.12s)]
*  It's known derisively as judge shopping, completely unethical. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=766.32s)]
*  And many of these restraining orders have one common denominator. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=771.4000000000001s)]
*  They're ordered by Democrat-appointed judges, exceeding their authority, contorting the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=775.2800000000001s)]
*  law to do it. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=780.6800000000001s)]
*  They are essentially usurping the power of the president and violating the separation [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=782.0600000000001s)]
*  of powers. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=787.24s)]
*  It's got to stop. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=788.6s)]
*  Congress can act. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=790.0200000000001s)]
*  So, Holly is prepared to introduce a bill to limit the authority of these judges, because, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=791.02s)]
*  remember, Congress created the court system and the judges, and they can limit and circumscribe [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=797.42s)]
*  their authority. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=804.42s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see what happens. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=805.42s)]
*  You know what? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=807.98s)]
*  It should, you know, you want to have fairness, but this just seems to be politics at play, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=808.98s)]
*  using the court system for the wrong reason. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=813.9s)]
*  All right, thanks so much, Greg. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkEcrf_ok34&t=815.66s)]
