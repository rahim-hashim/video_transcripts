# 'RFK'd' it!: Fast food chain announces major menu change
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg)
*  A major fast food giant is giving HHS Secretary RFK Jr. one of his first victories on the Make [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=0.0s)]
*  America Healthy Again, or Maha, agenda. Steak and Shake says all locations will be quote RFK'd [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=6.88s)]
*  as they swap vegetable oil for a healthier beef tallow to cook their iconic shoestring fries. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=16.88s)]
*  Steak and Shake Chief Operations Officer Daniel Edwards joins us right now from Texas. So Daniel, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=25.12s)]
*  you're really shaking it up with this beef tallow thing. Was this at the behest of Bobby Kennedy [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=32.0s)]
*  Jr. or have you been thinking about this for a while? We've actually been thinking about this [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=39.44s)]
*  for a while. Our owner, my boss, is a man named Sartar Biglari and when he was a little boy he [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=44.72s)]
*  went to Belgium and had fries and said these are the best fries I've ever had and they were actually [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  cooked in beef tallow. So he called me one time and said, you know, why should Europeans have [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=54.8s)]
*  better fries than Americans? Like we need to have the best Steak and Shake's classic American brand. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  We can't let anybody beat us. We gotta have the best fries. And we wanted to switch, I guess, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  years ago, but they couldn't get a chemical-free, additive-free, all-natural pure beef tallow [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=68.8s)]
*  because they put defoaming agents and things. So he tells me we have to do beef tallow but we have [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  to do it all natural, no additives, no preservatives. And we found a supplier that could finally do that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=79.92s)]
*  for us and he said we gotta do it, we gotta do it everywhere and so we did. Okay. We RFK'd our fries. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=84.32s)]
*  Indeed. So all your locations by March 1st are going to have french fries in beef tallow. I know [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  RFK Jr. not a fan of seed oils but ultimately it comes down to, as you know, Daniel, it comes down [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=96.0s)]
*  to the taste. So does it taste as good as, you know, one of those other fries that we have grown [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  accustomed to? They're so much better. We're actually famous for, as you mentioned, for our [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=110.16s)]
*  shoestring fries. Right. And these fries cooked in, the same fry cooked in beef tallow is crispier, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  it's golden brown, it's absolutely delicious and you're gonna love them when you try them. You're [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=123.12s)]
*  not gonna want to ever go back to the old way of doing fries. And it's the authentic way, it's the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=127.84s)]
*  original way. Well you guys are the original, home of the original steak burger, so I look forward to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=131.2s)]
*  trying that out. What about vegetarians? They're gonna skip your fries because they're cooked in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=137.36s)]
*  beef tallow oil. Yes. Well we love our vegetarians. We've got the best milkshakes, Zagat rated number [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  one milkshakes at Steak and Shake and, you know, part of being a classic American brand, you know, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=150.8s)]
*  we've been around for over 90 years selling steak burgers. We're famous for steak burgers and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  and fries so we understand that they have the freedom to choose. We're an American brand, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  we believe in freedom, we believe that they have the freedom to choose what's best for them [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=165.12s)]
*  and no problem. We think we can all get along, have a milkshake and those that enjoy the beef [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=168.72s)]
*  tallow fries and the steak burgers, they'll enjoy that. Sure. Daniel, exit question and it's a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=174.32s)]
*  business question. Isn't it more expensive to do this? I mean to make the process a little cleaner, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=180.8s)]
*  ultimately it's going to cost you a little more money, right? Yeah, we're not worried about that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  Our focus is really quality so we've been on a quality journey for a while now so increasing [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=192.96s)]
*  the quality of everything in the restaurant and that's a secondary consideration. Americans [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=198.56s)]
*  deserve the best, we're going to give them the best and we're very excited about it. You even [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  get a stem on the cherry of your milkshake, Steve. So when you go to get your milkshake, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=207.36s)]
*  real whipped cream, 100% real whipped homemade whipped cream on your shake, homemade ice cream [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=212.0s)]
*  and then when you get your cherry on top, it's got a stem. We didn't even cut the three cents [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=218.32s)]
*  to get a stemless cherry. No kidding. Listen, on your website I was just looking at your Oreo [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=222.32s)]
*  red velvet milkshake. It looks to die for. They've been RFK'd. The fries have. Daniel Edwards there [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  at stake and Shake in San Antonio. Daniel, thank you very much and good luck to you. Thanks, sir. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=236.72s)]
*  Bye-bye. Can't wait to try it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKSsTihDHVg&t=243.28s)]
