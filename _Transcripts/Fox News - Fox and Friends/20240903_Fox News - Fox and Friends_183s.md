# UNC frat rewarded with 'epic rager' after defending American flag
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4)
*  In an act of patriotic defiance, UNC Chapel Hill Fraternity Brothers defended the American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=0.0s)]
*  flag from anti-Israel protesters this spring. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=6.4s)]
*  And yesterday, they finally got their epic rager in return. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=10.48s)]
*  Dubbed Flagstock, the party featured musical guests, including our next guest, singer-songwriter [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=14.44s)]
*  John Andrasik, better known for Five for Fighting, joins us live right now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  John, good morning to you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=26.64s)]
*  Good to see all you guys. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=29.0s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=30.0s)]
*  We want to know about Flag Fest. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=31.0s)]
*  How was it? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=33.2s)]
*  You know, Steve, ironically, at our rally, nobody wore a mask. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=34.2s)]
*  I guess when you sing about freedom and human rights and women's rights and condemn the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  evil that is Hamas, nobody's afraid to show their face. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=45.2s)]
*  For me, it was a very emotional night. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  Obviously, many of us who work closely with Rachel Goldberg are still mourning Hirsch and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=51.8s)]
*  his murder. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=57.720000000000006s)]
*  But it was cathartic to thank these boys in person, to perform. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=58.720000000000006s)]
*  I should call them men, not boys, because they're men, to perform for them, to sing [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  for them, to go out in the crowd, take pictures, talk to the students, hear their stories, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=67.28s)]
*  particularly the Jewish students who've been under siege. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=73.08s)]
*  So it was wonderful. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=76.12s)]
*  It was great. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=77.2s)]
*  There were flyovers, there were fireworks, and the beer was free. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=78.2s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=81.44s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=82.44s)]
*  John Rich on stage with you and Lee Greenwood was up there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=83.44s)]
*  I'm sure a lot of students came. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=88.08s)]
*  They didn't even announce where the location was going to be until the last minute because [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=89.72s)]
*  they wanted to keep it secure and safe for all the students that were there. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=92.52s)]
*  How did you get involved with it? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=96.8s)]
*  I know there was a GoFundMe page and they raised within a week $515,000 just to thank [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=97.8s)]
*  these fraternity brothers. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=103.52s)]
*  But how did you get involved and how did the others get involved? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=105.36s)]
*  Well, certainly, you know, with the work we've been doing for Israel and as Brian knows, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=109.32s)]
*  my Afghanistan song and Ukraine song, I think very few artists are afraid to stand up for [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=114.08s)]
*  the right thing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  So credit to John Rich and credit to John Noonan who put this song. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  And to your point, what does it say about America when a concept that's being held [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  for boys that rescued American flag has to be held in an undisclosed location? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=128.32s)]
*  The kids didn't even know where it was because people are afraid for their safety because [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  they rescued an American flag. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=138.52s)]
*  I think it's an example to everybody that we have to stand up. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=140.52s)]
*  We cannot be intimidated. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=144.08s)]
*  We are in the right and you do that with rock and roll and you do that with heart. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  And if people want to download any of your songs for a good cause in 20 seconds, where [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=150.24s)]
*  do we go? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=153.32000000000002s)]
*  Fiverrfighting.com, Brian. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  You know, I appreciate it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=156.8s)]
*  We're all fighting the good fight and this will not be the last concert. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  We'll be heading to our college campuses. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  We're fighting back. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=164.0s)]
*  We're all doing the right thing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=165.52s)]
*  And we'll be covering it, John. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=166.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=168.28s)]
*  You do so much good work, John. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtYCelRov4&t=169.48s)]
