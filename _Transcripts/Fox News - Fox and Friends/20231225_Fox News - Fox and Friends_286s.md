# Pope Francis says children suffering from war are the ‘Jesuses of today’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ)
*  Today, in Bethlehem, amid the deep shadows covering the land, an undying flame has been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=0.0s)]
*  lighted. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Today, the world's darkness has been overcome by the light of God, which enlightens every [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  man and woman, all those little ones whose childhood has been devastated by war. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=18.04s)]
*  These are the little Jesuses of today. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  That was moments ago in Vatican City, Pope Francis giving the traditional Christmas [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=28.16s)]
*  blessing from the Vatican, making peace a central theme as millions celebrate under [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=31.92s)]
*  the cloud of war and tragedy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=37.14s)]
*  Joining us now with the message of hope and triumph, retired Navy SEAL and recon Marine [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=39.08s)]
*  veteran Mark Cirelli. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=43.4s)]
*  Mike, Merry Christmas to you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=47.64s)]
*  Thank you for your service and coming on this morning to bring your message of peace. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=48.78s)]
*  I want to talk to you about that, but you heard the pope there and giving his message [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=54.48s)]
*  and his message. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=58.8s)]
*  He really was hitting what he called the feudal logic of war in the very land where Jesus [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=60.019999999999996s)]
*  himself was born. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=70.12s)]
*  First off, Merry Christmas, Griff. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=73.12s)]
*  Peace on earth should be our primary pursuit, especially for those coming behind us, but [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=75.6s)]
*  it's also a multifaceted concept. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=80.32s)]
*  It requires a deep understanding of the harsh realities of the world where power struggles [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=83.0s)]
*  and conflict are just part of human nature. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=87.12s)]
*  But for those that have seen the worst of human conflict, we understand that peace on [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=89.92s)]
*  earth may not mean the absence of conflict in its entirety. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=94.16s)]
*  Now peace is not a passive sort of state that simply happens. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=99.32s)]
*  It happens by us making it so by actively pursuing it and sacrificing for especially [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=104.26s)]
*  when it's uncomfortable or it's unpopular. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=110.22s)]
*  Now here's the hope is that we learn and grow so that we break the silence of or the cycle [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=113.14s)]
*  of violence by passing those lessons on to the future generation so they live in a more [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=120.22s)]
*  just, compassionate and safer world. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=125.58s)]
*  That's such a powerful message, Mike, and nobody knows the true significance of hope [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=129.64s)]
*  like war fighters like yourself. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=136.42s)]
*  The old saying is there are no atheists in a foxhole. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=138.26s)]
*  You've been in a lot of foxholes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=141.78s)]
*  Expand a little bit on what that means for those like yourself who have served and made [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=143.85999999999999s)]
*  sacrifices for our nation. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=149.45999999999998s)]
*  And now at this time of Christmas, reflecting on, you know, the sacrifices you've made for [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=151.14s)]
*  that promise of hope. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, Griff, what a lot of people don't understand is that the military is in the profession [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=159.98s)]
*  of peace trained in the art of war. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=165.24s)]
*  You know, a lot of people don't pray to God when times are good, but especially on the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=168.4s)]
*  battlefield when matters are life and death, you find yourself close to God. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=173.84s)]
*  And there's something interesting about being with your brothers and sisters in arms. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=180.0s)]
*  You will never feel an emotional intimacy, a love as deep as that, that that is all you [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  thankful for that companionship, that homecoming and belonging despite being in a war zone. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=192.1s)]
*  And the hope is that the conflict ends quickly. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=198.54s)]
*  And you know, I wish more people could experience it in a way. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=202.66s)]
*  I'm glad they don't. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=206.94s)]
*  But ultimately, the sacrifices of our soldiers forward right now for those that gave their [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=208.94s)]
*  lives in the global war on terror, the whole point is so that others don't have to go forward [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=213.66s)]
*  and do it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=218.72s)]
*  And the reality of the world is we've got to actively pursue it and be vigilant. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=219.72s)]
*  And Mike, just in the last 30 seconds, I've got left. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=224.68s)]
*  I want to let you just give a shout out not only to the men and women that made the sacrifice [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=226.96s)]
*  and serve, but also to the chaplains. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=231.56s)]
*  I during the invasion of Iraq in 2003 had the honor and privilege of listening to an [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=233.8s)]
*  Easter sermon from a chaplain. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=239.0s)]
*  And it really galvanized the unit of Marines we were with HMM 268 in a very difficult time [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=241.28s)]
*  in the battle in Iraq. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=247.72s)]
*  Well, I want to send my blessings to all the gold star families, all the military families [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  who have ones deployed in the chaplains. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=254.5s)]
*  All I can say is that they were our spiritual and emotional rock in watching them do some [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=257.82s)]
*  of the things they did on the battlefield was inspiring and it gave us hope. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  Mike Cirelli, thank you for your service and Merry Christmas to you, your family and loved [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=268.04s)]
*  ones. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=271.96s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=272.96s)]
*  Likewise. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=273.96s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=274.96s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e56rXqfscoQ&t=275.96s)]
