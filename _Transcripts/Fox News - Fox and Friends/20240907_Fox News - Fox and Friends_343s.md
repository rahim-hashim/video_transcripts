# 'OVERWHELMING SUPPORT': National Fraternal Order of Police endorses Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk)
*  All right, let's move to this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=0.0s)]
*  This is an important story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=0.84s)]
*  Yesterday, former President Trump [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=1.68s)]
*  accepted the official endorsement [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=3.24s)]
*  from the National Fraternal Order of Police, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  promising to back the blue. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=6.72s)]
*  They're protecting the criminals [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=9.96s)]
*  and not protecting the law abiding citizens. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=11.28s)]
*  We will bring back law and order to our nation, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=13.48s)]
*  and we will give the heroes in blue the power [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=17.04s)]
*  to legally protect us and the respect that you deserve. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=19.68s)]
*  And while Kamala Harris tries to rebrand herself [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=25.28s)]
*  as tough on crime, critics point out [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=27.6s)]
*  she wants to back the plan to not charge drug dealers [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=29.36s)]
*  in San Francisco until a third offense. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=32.4s)]
*  So here to react, National Fraternal Order [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=35.2s)]
*  of Police President Patrick Yoos. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=37.08s)]
*  Thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=39.16s)]
*  First, let's talk about the endorsement of President Trump. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=40.84s)]
*  Why did the Fraternal Order of Police [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=44.2s)]
*  decide to endorse Donald Trump? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=46.96s)]
*  Well, our endorsement process is pretty unique. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=49.36s)]
*  It's pretty extensive as well. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=52.28s)]
*  Our members get to make this decision. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=54.0s)]
*  So as a result, we have members across this country [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=55.620000000000005s)]
*  are making this selection between two candidates [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=58.36s)]
*  based off of what real conditions are [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=61.4s)]
*  within their communities. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=63.16s)]
*  So what we're seeing is an overwhelming support [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=64.68s)]
*  for President Trump. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=66.88s)]
*  And much of that probably has to do [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=67.72s)]
*  with the revolving door of criminal justice system [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=69.2s)]
*  with the open borders that have created chaos [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=73.16s)]
*  within our communities. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=76.0s)]
*  So our members made a very thoughtful decision [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=76.88s)]
*  and we voted yesterday, took the poll across the country, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=80.44s)]
*  and it was overwhelming for President Trump. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=85.08s)]
*  You know, Vice President Harris is attempting [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  to rebrand herself as law and order. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=89.12s)]
*  She's styled herself a prosecutor for the people. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=92.08s)]
*  How did that message resonate with your officers? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=95.76s)]
*  Well, our members are very real and they understand. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  They're part of this system and truly understand it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  So we see every day what's happening [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  within our criminal justice system from across this country. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  So it's not hard for us to kind of weed through [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=114.04s)]
*  what is reality and what is maybe perception by some people. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=117.48s)]
*  We know what's happening across this country. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=121.12s)]
*  We know when we take violent criminals out of the lives [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=123.04s)]
*  of people that they prey on, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=125.72s)]
*  then we have an ability to reduce crime. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  And that's not what we're seeing now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  We're seeing a revolving door process in this country [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=131.36s)]
*  where criminals are allowed to continue their carnage. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, here's to your point of separating, you know, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  branding versus reality. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=142.32s)]
*  Here's what Harris is saying today [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  about her approach to crime. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=145.72s)]
*  I took on perpetrators of all kinds. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  I took on perpetrators of all kinds. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=150.88s)]
*  Predators who abused women. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=153.22s)]
*  Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=157.64s)]
*  Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  That's what she's saying today. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  But she said, or rather a police chief, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=170.56s)]
*  when she was district attorney, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=173.76s)]
*  said this about her leniency. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=175.4s)]
*  He said, this proposal asks us not to arrest [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=176.88s)]
*  but instead detain and release observed [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=180.36s)]
*  narcotic sales suspects. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  When the same suspect is arrested, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=184.16s)]
*  the third time for narcotic sales, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=185.84s)]
*  your office would then charge all three counts. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=187.8s)]
*  So that's from 2005. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=189.96s)]
*  So a little bit of what you described there, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  a reality on the streets and what you experience [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=194.72s)]
*  versus the current branding. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=196.88s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'll say this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=199.28s)]
*  You know, we can listen to what she says [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=201.76s)]
*  and have to take her on our word [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=203.84s)]
*  and see whether she actually produces it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=205.64s)]
*  But let me tell you what my members know. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=207.0s)]
*  My members know that when President Trump was in office, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  we worked side by side and we did the first reform [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=211.28s)]
*  to the criminal justice system in 40 years [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=214.6s)]
*  with the First Step Act. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=216.6s)]
*  And we're proud to be part of that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=217.56s)]
*  We were part of the commission on law enforcement [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=219.12s)]
*  and administration of justice, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  long before President Trump put in place, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=224.16s)]
*  long before this was, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=226.88s)]
*  law enforcement to our policing [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=228.28s)]
*  was a political battleground. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=229.8s)]
*  So constructively working towards real solutions [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=230.96s)]
*  to fixing problems is something that we know [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=233.96s)]
*  that we've been able to do with President Trump. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=235.76s)]
*  My members know that because they were part of that journey [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=238.28s)]
*  in contrasting where we are now today in society. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=240.72s)]
*  I think that that's what drove their decisions. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=245.28s)]
*  And those decisions are interesting [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=247.8s)]
*  and what we need to recognize is they are the barometer [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=250.28s)]
*  of every state because our members are all over [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=253.24s)]
*  and they made these decisions overwhelmingly [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=255.44s)]
*  for President Trump. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=257.72s)]
*  You know, a couple of weeks ago, Patrick, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=258.92s)]
*  I got to surround myself [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=260.52s)]
*  with some of America's elite warriors. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=262.6s)]
*  I was with some Navy SEALs here in New York City [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  and I just took an informal poll. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=267.24s)]
*  I said, I'm curious, what percentage of the Navy SEALs [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=268.76s)]
*  would you say support Donald Trump? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=272.24s)]
*  And the answer I got back was 99%. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=274.64s)]
*  And then a small adjustment was made [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=277.48s)]
*  for the officer class who might be seeking higher careers. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=279.68s)]
*  It was adjusted down to 98%. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm just curious, you said overwhelming. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=284.44s)]
*  Could you share with me the vote? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  What was the vote for Trump versus Harris [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=287.6s)]
*  on the endorsement? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=290.36s)]
*  Well, I'll leave that as our internal process. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=291.6s)]
*  I will say this, I have 377,000 members [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=294.32s)]
*  and I'm not here to tell you that all of them agree with this. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=298.76s)]
*  They all have their political reasons why [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=301.56s)]
*  and I respect every one of them. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=303.44s)]
*  I do also respect the process [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  and that process allowed our members [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  to be part of this discussion and make this decision. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=308.32s)]
*  And when that vote was taken yesterday, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  I will tell you that it was overwhelming [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  in support of President Trump. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  Okay, so no numbers, but overwhelming [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=316.92s)]
*  is what you'll leave me with. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=318.88s)]
*  Overwhelming. Okay. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, we appreciate you being with us this morning [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=321.24s)]
*  and in contributing what you have to this election [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=323.48s)]
*  in the form of your endorsement [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdJiWa_JkUk&t=326.28000000000003s)]
