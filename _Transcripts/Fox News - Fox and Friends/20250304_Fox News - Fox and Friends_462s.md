# Dems plan to disrupt Trump speech with props: report
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc)
*  Meanwhile, here in our nation's Capitol, President Trump is set to focus on the renewal of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=0.0s)]
*  American Dream and is addressed to a joint session of Congress for the first time in [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  his second term. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=9.38s)]
*  And it's sure to be a historical moment for our president tonight. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=12.14s)]
*  Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins us now from Capitol Hill. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  Good morning to you, Chad. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=21.42s)]
*  Well, you know, Article 2, Section 3 of the Constitution says the president shall from [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=22.42s)]
*  time to time give Congress information on the state of the union, but nowhere is it [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=26.5s)]
*  written down that they have to come to Capitol Hill and give a speech. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=31.62s)]
*  A speech is not required. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=35.5s)]
*  It was President Washington who gave the first speech in New York, and then it was Thomas [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=36.82s)]
*  Jefferson who just continued that practice. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=41.22s)]
*  He kind of viewed this as a little bit too much of a speech from the crown. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=43.78s)]
*  So for 112 years, this report was written and handed in like homework to Congress. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=47.82s)]
*  And it was President Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th century who revived this custom. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=54.28s)]
*  And then we kind of got into media. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=59.02s)]
*  And this is a big media affair tonight. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=60.82s)]
*  It was President Calvin Coolidge in 1923, who was the first president to have his State [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=62.88s)]
*  of the Union address broadcast on the radio. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=67.88s)]
*  Then you had Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who, of course, was the master of the radio. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=70.6s)]
*  He was known for his fireside chats during the Great Depression and World War II. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=75.18s)]
*  And so that was, you know, part and parcel of his delivery of this speech. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=79.86s)]
*  It first went on television in 1947 with Harry Truman, and then a big change in the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=84.04s)]
*  mid-1960s. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=89.56s)]
*  They had this thing called prime time. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=90.56s)]
*  And it was Lyndon Baines Johnson, the president, who moved the speech to prime time in the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  evening. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  And if you look at a picture from that speech, it's about five minutes, six minutes after [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  nine o'clock in the evening. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=103.02000000000001s)]
*  And then it was President Clinton, who was the first president to stream the speech on [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=104.78s)]
*  the internet. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=109.0s)]
*  Guys? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=110.0s)]
*  ...applied to spoil Trump's speech, and it wouldn't be the first time a presidential [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=111.96s)]
*  address in Congress has been interrupted, right? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=117.32s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=121.36s)]
*  Well, sometimes you have, you know, some members of the minority party get up and yell and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=122.36s)]
*  heckle. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=126.0s)]
*  You know, we're going to watch very closely what some of the Democrats are wearing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=127.0s)]
*  I'm told that some of the women will wear white because of suffrage. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=130.16s)]
*  They might have Ukrainian flags. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=133.44s)]
*  And some people don't remember the speech because you have these extracurriculars. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=135.32s)]
*  It was in 1982 where President Reagan brought the first guest to one of these speeches, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=139.8s)]
*  and that's become a custom. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=144.68s)]
*  You had the Air Florida crash into the 14th Street Bridge, and there was a CBO employee [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  by the name of Lenny Skutnik. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=150.8s)]
*  And it was a freezing, ice-cold day in Washington, and he famously dove into the river and rescued [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=153.12s)]
*  one of the passengers. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=157.84s)]
*  And it was President Reagan who, about 13, 14 days later, invited him and started this [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=159.36s)]
*  custom of always having people in the House chamber. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=164.0s)]
*  There was a disruption. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=167.28s)]
*  This was not a State of the Union address, but September of 2009, you had President Obama [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=168.42s)]
*  giving his Obamacare speech, and he was hectored by Joe Wilson, the Republican representative [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=173.06s)]
*  from South Carolina. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=177.82s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=178.82s)]
*  There are also those who claim that our reform efforts would ensure illegal immigrants. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=179.82s)]
*  This too is false. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=188.5s)]
*  The reforms, the reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegal. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=191.06s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=197.5s)]
*  Now Nancy Pelosi, in 2020, she made some headlines when she famously ripped up President Trump's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=204.06s)]
*  speech. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=210.3s)]
*  He was going to be acquitted the next day in his Senate trial, the first Senate trial. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=211.34s)]
*  And last year, Steve Nakui, he was removed over an outburst. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=216.34s)]
*  His son, Kareem, was killed in Afghanistan during the withdrawal from Abbey Gate there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=220.58s)]
*  He was pulled out by the Secret Service and also the Capitol Police. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=225.94s)]
*  He was charged, but those charges were later dropped. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=229.24s)]
*  So sometimes we remember the other things that go on during these State of the Union [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=231.7s)]
*  speeches and not so much the content from the dais. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=234.9s)]
*  What a great historical perspective. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=238.22s)]
*  And I love the fact, Chad, that you brought up that guy who helped fish one person out [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=240.54s)]
*  of the Potomac during the Reagan years, Lenny Skutnik. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=245.94s)]
*  And in fact, four years after that, that first appearance where he was a guest of, Ronald [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=250.18s)]
*  Reagan, they referred to that person as, OK, who's our Skutnik this time? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=254.89999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=258.58s)]
*  And he didn't have a guest the next year. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=259.58s)]
*  But then it's become a tradition where you have the president, the speaker of the House. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  In fact, I just reached out to the speaker's office to see who they were going to bring [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=264.86s)]
*  in to the speech tonight. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=267.98s)]
*  And sometimes it's a little bit like a West Side story. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=270.3s)]
*  It's kind of like the sharks and the jets. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=273.02s)]
*  And everybody brings the people who are on their side to make their showing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=274.94s)]
*  And the Democrats this year, we're told, are going to be bringing a lot of fired or furloughed [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=278.74s)]
*  federal workers to protest Doge. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=283.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=285.78s)]
*  It's becoming a little bit, Chad, like the like the British, where they just yell at [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=286.78s)]
*  their prime minister and he gets up and sits down. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  Remember Lakin Reilly? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=295.42s)]
*  Remember when Marjorie Teller-Green said, say her name, he said Lakin Reilly and he [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=296.8s)]
*  said Lincoln Reilly. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=301.02s)]
*  But that was also the give and take. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=302.7s)]
*  They kind of saved Joe Biden. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=304.5s)]
*  He seemed to be tanking his speech and that that pepped him up again. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=306.14s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=310.26s)]
*  And sometimes that's the things that you can't predict about what's going to to come out [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=311.72s)]
*  of a speech. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=315.88000000000005s)]
*  You know, people remember they thought that President Biden last year, certainly after [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=316.88000000000005s)]
*  that point, it was a more energetic speech, especially if you contrast that with his debate [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=320.62s)]
*  performance in June, which pretty much tanked his presidential bid. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=325.72s)]
*  But that's the importance of these speeches, because a lot of Americans don't tune in. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=329.76000000000005s)]
*  They don't watch TV every day. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=333.92s)]
*  They don't tune into the Internet, but they watch this speech or they watch clips that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=335.8s)]
*  that's their dose of politics for the year. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=340.3s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=342.54s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=343.54s)]
*  There's an article in Axios and the headline says some Dems plot to disrupt Trump's speech [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=344.54s)]
*  to Congress. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=350.38s)]
*  If you read the article, it says that some might walk out, bring in props like noisemakers [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=351.38s)]
*  and hand clappers, red cards, pocket constitutions, empty egg containers and signs with anti-Trump, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=355.74s)]
*  anti-Doge messages. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=363.42s)]
*  Even though there was a closed door meeting yesterday on the House floor and lawmakers [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=365.18s)]
*  were discouraged from using props. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=368.62s)]
*  I just don't understand how we're supposed to take them seriously. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=371.26s)]
*  This is not a sporting event, even though I understand. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=374.62s)]
*  New Year's Eve. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=377.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=378.1s)]
*  What are you guys doing? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=379.1s)]
*  And then to the egg point, I mean, have you seen the chart from the Secretary of Agriculture? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=380.1s)]
*  Eggs have been going up way before Donald Trump. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=385.14s)]
*  He's only been in office less than two months. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=387.38s)]
*  And now you want to make you didn't talk about eggs the entire presidential race. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=389.98s)]
*  You wanted to talk about the threats to democracy and all that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=393.94s)]
*  And by the way, the Constitution, I mean, real rich. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=396.54s)]
*  You've been targeting your political opponents using the Department of Justice. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=399.58s)]
*  And now you care about the Constitution. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=403.02s)]
*  Well, egg prices are high because of bird flu. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=405.02s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQqOhJpnBc&t=408.18s)]
