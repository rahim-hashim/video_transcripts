# NORAD addresses drone fears as Santa begins Christmas Eve flight
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc)
*  See, even we're following Santa's journey around the world right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=0.0s)]
*  Breaking news. He's over New Zealand. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=3.72s)]
*  This is live and he's using the Waze app. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=5.64s)]
*  He's going to get there quicker this year. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=7.72s)]
*  The North American Aerospace Defense Command known as NORAD has been tracking [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=9.44s)]
*  St. Nick now for almost 70 years. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=13.76s)]
*  U.S. Northern Command and NORAD Commander General Gregory Gio is here with the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=17.04s)]
*  latest on Santa's flight. Thank you so much for being here. We're so excited. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=21.64s)]
*  We track Santa every year. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=25.84s)]
*  Todd, do you do it with your kiddos? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=28.76s)]
*  They're a little young, but I think we're going to do it this year. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=30.32s)]
*  So that begs the question. We're over New Zealand. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=33.36s)]
*  Where are we going next, General? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=36.52s)]
*  Well, we never actually know where he's going to go. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=39.68s)]
*  He doesn't file a flight plan with us, but we use our satellites, our radars and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  fighter jets to track him and make sure that he has a safe route. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=45.84s)]
*  But we think it'll continue west, probably towards Asia next. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=49.24s)]
*  So when did this whole tradition start? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=53.8s)]
*  I understand it has started really in the 1950s when we got the technology, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=56.36s)]
*  correct? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=59.84s)]
*  But also kind of by accident, right? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=61.12s)]
*  Exactly right for both. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=63.88s)]
*  In 1955, it was a wrong phone number that called the NORAD [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=65.36s)]
*  Operations Center with a child asking to speak to Santa. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=70.72s)]
*  And a improvising colonel told him that the child, there's nothing to worry about. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=74.08s)]
*  Everything's good with Santa and we've been doing it every year since. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=80.92s)]
*  So this is the 69th year. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=83.56s)]
*  Wow, I absolutely love that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=86.32s)]
*  Now, General, as a resident of New Jersey, I have a really big question for you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=87.96s)]
*  We've been having some drone issues. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure you're aware of them. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=95.08s)]
*  And since you know everything about aerospace warning, Santa is going to be [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=96.44s)]
*  OK with all these drones, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=101.63999999999999s)]
*  Santa will be just fine. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=104.16s)]
*  Of course, we are concerned about drones and anything else in the air. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=105.32s)]
*  And there are a lot of other agencies that are helping us with that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=109.32s)]
*  But I don't foresee any difficulty at all with drones for Santa this year. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=111.96s)]
*  General, what's your message to the children who may be watching, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=115.76s)]
*  who may have decided they're going to be tricky this year, they're going to be smart [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=118.72s)]
*  and try to catch Santa in the act? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  What is your message to them? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=125.04s)]
*  Big mistake. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=126.48s)]
*  That's exactly right. Big, big mistake. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  Santa will not stop if the children are awake. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=130.96s)]
*  And so my message is get to bed before nine o'clock [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=134.6s)]
*  and your chances for presence go up quite a bit. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=137.96s)]
*  Don't be awake. He'll pass you by. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=142.6s)]
*  General, it's just amazing when you're sleeping. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=144.68s)]
*  Yeah. And that's been confirmed. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  General, it's amazing. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=148.72s)]
*  Most people file their journeys with you. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=149.56s)]
*  You admit you can't control Santa. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=152.52s)]
*  So you just track him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=154.8s)]
*  Are you OK with this relationship? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=156.56s)]
*  I am because he's shown great skill and proficiency over the years as an aviator, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=159.32s)]
*  great navigation system with the reindeer and Rudolph. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  So we're happy just to flight follow flying formation with him. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  But we don't have any concerns about safety or his navigation. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=172.76s)]
*  He's he's a pro. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  Are you surprised this hat never flies off? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=178.28s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=182.44s)]
*  I haven't thought about it, but he does so many things that are magical. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=183.68s)]
*  I guess keeping his hat on is just right up there with the rest of them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=186.44s)]
*  Well, my household is a huge fan and general, we will be we will be tracking [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=189.56s)]
*  all along with you all day and night. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=193.92s)]
*  And you can track Santa at Norad Santa doc dot org from home. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=195.92s)]
*  Thank you so much, General. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  Have a merry, merry Christmas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=202.44s)]
*  Thank you. Merry Christmas to you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5rFV7KU5Nc&t=204.51999999999998s)]
