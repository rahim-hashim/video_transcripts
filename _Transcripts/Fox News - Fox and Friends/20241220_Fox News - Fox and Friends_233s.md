# Fani Willis was 'terrified' of taking on Trump, says attorney
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ)
*  Well, President-elect Donald Trump's final legal battle is likely over after Georgia, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=0.0s)]
*  a Georgia appeals court disqualified Fulton County DA Fonny Willis and her team from Trump [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=7.36s)]
*  in an election interference case. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=13.32s)]
*  That one, remember? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=15.56s)]
*  The court writing, an appearance of impropriety generally is not enough to support disqualification. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=16.56s)]
*  This is the rare case in which disqualification is mandated and no other remedy will suffice [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  to restore public confidence in the integrity of these proceedings. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=27.04s)]
*  Attorney Ashley Merchant led the effort to oust Willis from the case and she joins us [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=31.56s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=35.4s)]
*  Ashley, good morning to you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=36.4s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=37.4s)]
*  Okay, so if you would, just let's start at the beginning. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=38.4s)]
*  Explain how you had knowledge that nobody else had that Nathan Wade was having a relationship [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=42.28s)]
*  with the DA Fonny Willis who hired him. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=50.8s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  It's a unique set of circumstances. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=55.48s)]
*  It's really relationships. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=57.12s)]
*  So I knew Nathan Wade. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  I knew Nathan Wade personally. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  I knew Fonny Willis personally. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  And I also knew their friends and law partners, their former friends and law partners. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  And so they, in the legal community, we were talking about this and they divulged all of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=67.52s)]
*  this information to me. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=71.24s)]
*  And I just sort of started tracking it down and closing different loops and investigating. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=72.62s)]
*  And it blossomed into something that I knew I had to do something about and became actionable. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=77.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=83.16000000000001s)]
*  And we saw it play out, you know, months ago where the judge of the case was trying to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  figure out, hey, you know, is there a conflict of interest here? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=87.76s)]
*  It was so obvious there was. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  And the irony is the case of the conflict of interest was so much stronger actually [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  than the case against Donald Trump. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=100.2s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=102.92s)]
*  It really was. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=103.92s)]
*  I mean, it was something that you couldn't turn your eye away from. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=104.92s)]
*  And I think that's what the Court of Appeals said. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=107.26s)]
*  You know, this is just, it's one of those things that you know it when you see it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=108.92s)]
*  It's the appearance of impropriety. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=112.16s)]
*  It is so great that it had to be enough to kick them off the case. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=113.16s)]
*  And I think it's really, it's clear, you know, how Fonny Willis has dug in from the beginning. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  She started this and, you know, she could have done the right thing early on whenever [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=123.36s)]
*  we brought this to everyone's attention and said, hey, let's have a neutral prosecutor [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=127.14s)]
*  handle this case. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=131.68s)]
*  Let's have someone else look at it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=132.68s)]
*  But I think she was terrified because her case is so weak. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=133.88s)]
*  She didn't want to have someone look at it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=136.68s)]
*  In fact, she has been saying, you know, up until the bitter end, she would go ahead and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  wait until the end of the Trump term to bring this case, if necessary. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=144.56s)]
*  Donald Trump had a statement to Fox News Digital. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  He said, there is no way such corrupt people can lead a case and then it gets taken over [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=151.38s)]
*  by somebody else. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  The case is entirely dead. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=157.64s)]
*  Everybody should receive an apology, including those wonderful patriots who have been caught [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=159.6s)]
*  up in this for years. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=164.01999999999998s)]
*  So that's what he says. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=166.2s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal today, Ashley says, a smart move for Georgia would be to end this, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=167.2s)]
*  drop the case. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=171.56s)]
*  It never should have been brought. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=172.56s)]
*  But technically, they could keep it alive. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=173.92s)]
*  It's really up to the state, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=176.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=178.32s)]
*  It's up to a group called Prosecuting Attorneys Council, PAC. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=179.32s)]
*  It's an independent prosecuting agency. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=182.2s)]
*  They can decide what to do. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=184.29999999999998s)]
*  But Bert Jones was early, who's our lieutenant governor in Georgia. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  He was taken off the case early. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=188.83999999999997s)]
*  He was separated out and Fonny Willis was disqualified. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  And when they looked at it, they said, we're not going to prosecute this. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=193.12s)]
*  So I think I've always thought if a neutral prosecutor, someone who didn't have a financial [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=196.36s)]
*  interest in this case and a political interest in this case, looked at it, that they would [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=200.16s)]
*  see things differently and they would decide that the taxpayers, the courts, the people [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=204.36s)]
*  who are charged with this case, they deserve this case to be dismissed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=208.8s)]
*  Well, congratulations to you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=212.28s)]
*  This was what you were after. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=214.1s)]
*  You really cracked the case. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=215.48s)]
*  So Christmas came early for you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=217.22s)]
*  It did come early. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=219.44s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=220.44s)]
*  You bet. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_Pj2mz7aQ&t=221.44s)]
