*  There you heard Donald Trump with Maria Bartiromo [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  Who joins us now [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  The anchor of Sunday Morning's Future here with some Fox and Friends [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=65.2s)]
*  Maria, well first of all there's a serious [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=67.2s)]
*  There's the light side, wow [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=69.2s)]
*  What petty theft or grand larceny [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=71.2s)]
*  But then there's the serious side [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=73.2s)]
*  How does she reconcile that against the policy she's been a part of with Biden Harris [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=75.2s)]
*  Where they've gone after haven't they not [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=77.2s)]
*  With the IRS [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=79.2s)]
*  Things like taxes on tips [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=81.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's right [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=83.28s)]
*  That happened last year when they were cracking down [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=85.28s)]
*  On tips wanting to tax them [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=87.28s)]
*  Look, Will, good morning to you [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=89.28s)]
*  It of course [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=91.28s)]
*  It is said that imitation [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=93.28s)]
*  Is the best form of flattery [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=95.28s)]
*  The question now is will she actually follow through [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=97.28s)]
*  President Trump has been known to have his finger on the pulse [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=99.28s)]
*  When it comes to economics [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=101.28s)]
*  He was a business man [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=103.28s)]
*  Ran a payroll [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=105.28s)]
*  He was a businessman [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=107.28s)]
*  Ran a payroll [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=109.36s)]
*  Obviously knows how to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=111.36s)]
*  Look for and actually achieve [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=113.36s)]
*  Economic growth [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=115.36s)]
*  He has shown us that in his own businesses [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=117.36s)]
*  And there is a reason that most voters trust [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=119.36s)]
*  Trump on the economy [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=121.36s)]
*  Over Kamala Harris right now [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=123.36s)]
*  But I think it's important to ask [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=125.36s)]
*  The question of trust [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=127.36s)]
*  Can we trust that she will actually [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=129.36s)]
*  Carry through and do that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=131.36s)]
*  Particularly since this ticket is among the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=133.36s)]
*  Biggest tax and spenders that we know of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=135.36s)]
*  President Biden's budget for 2025 [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=137.44000000000003s)]
*  Of course has already been released [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=139.44000000000003s)]
*  And it includes $5.5 trillion [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=141.44000000000003s)]
*  Of new taxes [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=143.44000000000003s)]
*  And higher taxes [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=145.44000000000003s)]
*  $5.5 trillion of higher taxes [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=147.44000000000003s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal last week [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=149.44000000000003s)]
*  Wrote this about Tim Waltz [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=151.44000000000003s)]
*  Kamala Harris's running mate [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=153.44000000000003s)]
*  The Minnesota tax and spend model [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=155.44000000000003s)]
*  Minnesota has long boasted the highest [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=157.44000000000003s)]
*  Taxes in the Midwest [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=159.44000000000003s)]
*  Including a top income tax rate [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=161.44000000000003s)]
*  9.85% [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=163.44000000000003s)]
*  That kicks in at $193,000 [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=165.52s)]
*  Only New York and Oregon tax their upper middle class more [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=169.52s)]
*  This from the Wall Street Journal [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=171.52s)]
*  Minnesota's corporate tax of 9.8% [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=173.52s)]
*  Also the nation's second highest [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=175.52s)]
*  After New Jersey [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=177.52s)]
*  And the state is among the few to impose [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=179.52s)]
*  A death tax [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=181.52s)]
*  Yes after you pay taxes your whole life [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=183.52s)]
*  Your heirs will have to pay 16% [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=185.52s)]
*  On what you leave them [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=187.52s)]
*  Statewide business property tax as well [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=189.52s)]
*  So it doesn't exactly jive [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=191.52s)]
*  With what we're seeing from her running mate [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  And what we have seen from Kamala Harris [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  As the vice president [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  And let's be clear if she really wanted [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  To cut taxes she could do so right now [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  After all she is the vice president [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  Right now [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  So we're talking about that this morning certainly [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  And we are talking about whether or not [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  We can trust if in fact that will materialize [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  Should she win the White House [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  But you know it's interesting to see [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  The economic differences in both [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  Of these campaigns [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  Trump Vance versus Kamala Harris [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=221.68s)]
*  Tim Waltz [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=223.68s)]
*  Because they are very different [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=225.68s)]
*  Very different you know [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=227.68s)]
*  President Trump has been very clear [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=229.68s)]
*  In terms of tapping into the energy sector [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=231.68s)]
*  Using the energy capacity in America [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=233.68s)]
*  To bring down inflation because you're bringing down [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=235.68s)]
*  Oil prices as well as create jobs [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=237.68s)]
*  Kamala Harris has said that she wants to ban fracking [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=239.68s)]
*  We don't really know [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=241.68s)]
*  What Kamala Harris is going to do [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=243.68s)]
*  Because she hasn't articulated it Will [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=245.68s)]
*  There's nothing on her website at all [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=247.68s)]
*  Still that is pointing to what she's going to do [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  Should she win the White House [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  She says she's going to have an economic plan next week [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  So we wait [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah all we have though is her past [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=257.76s)]
*  And she was the furthest left voting senator [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=259.76s)]
*  In the United States Senate [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=261.76s)]
*  It would be great to see a debate between [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=263.76s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris and presidential candidate [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=265.76s)]
*  Kamala Harris we can figure out maybe [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=267.76s)]
*  The distinct differences between the two of them [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaugxnUiK4&t=269.76s)]
