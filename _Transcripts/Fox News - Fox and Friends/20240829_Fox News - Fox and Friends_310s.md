# Dana Perino: This is BIZARRE.
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc)
*  After 39 days today Kamala Harris is finally giving her first formal interview [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=0.0s)]
*  Since becoming the Democratic nominee. How's it gonna go? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=5.22s)]
*  I want to discuss this with co-anchors America's newsroom. You guys want to participate you can [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=7.86s)]
*  Close to the five dame Brino Dana. This is a huge event [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=13.44s)]
*  It doesn't have to be but it is 9 o'clock tonight [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=17.54s)]
*  We're gonna be watching with Tim walls and the reason it's a huge event is because Kamala Harris and Tim walls have made it [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=19.94s)]
*  That way it should not be a big deal to do an interview as a presidential candidate [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=25.740000000000002s)]
*  The fact that we're all like on pins and needles like this could make or break her campaign tonight is [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=29.4s)]
*  Bizarre, but this kind of this whole season has been a little why do they do that Dana? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=34.64s)]
*  Because she kind of learned from her boss of the Biden big boy press conference [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=39.2s)]
*  It's always an interview because they they they push us away and then they decide they have to at some point [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=43.48s)]
*  I think in some ways because she's been snake-bitten by interviews in the past [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=50.56s)]
*  Okay, so she could go and do even like if it's an easy interview [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=55.84s)]
*  There's always seem to be something that came out of it that would then put her back in the corner for a while [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  And she'd be like I'm not gonna do any interviews for all that should come out and do another one and then she'd be [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=65.18s)]
*  Back the other thing is I think it's very interesting that politico put out that Tim walls [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=68.48s)]
*  They didn't want him to go out and do his own interviews because they don't even know what their own policies are together [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=72.92s)]
*  And one of the things that the media will do is if you have any sort of daylight [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=77.92s)]
*  Between the two then you will like drive a truck through it [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=82.36s)]
*  So she's being criticized for not having had any interviews [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=86.52s)]
*  Yeah, she's also being criticized for having Tim waltz next to her as sort of like her support [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=89.58s)]
*  Bothered by that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=96.56s)]
*  But again, you haven't had an interview doing okay, but I'm thinking that this is actually an interesting [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=97.92s)]
*  Maybe difficult situation for waltz because if she stumbles and then he's caught man [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=104.4s)]
*  Explaining her that's not a good look for the girl. Yeah [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's also awkward if you are the vice president and you just sit there like the potted plant, right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=113.36s)]
*  Does Dan a bash is he in and like even address him? I don't know. What are you doing here? And here's the thing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  They'll probably just then start like chit chat and whatever [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=124.84s)]
*  I think that this will be a tougher interview than they might anticipate [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=127.28s)]
*  However, the questions are pretty obvious about you would ask so they're they've been prepping for a week [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=131.0s)]
*  They've lost a grant like they they gave up that momentum that they had out of the convention and just sat back for five weeks [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  Getting five days getting ready for our K jr. Change five days to get ready for this by the way [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=142.16s)]
*  Just like the while we're doing this just put the flip-flops that we that she's got to address [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  It's unbelievable as she's changed her policies through surrogates [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=151.04s)]
*  So that full screen will be available in the after show show [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=155.2s)]
*  Meanwhile [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=157.8s)]
*  Some brand-new Fox News polls came out for the Sun Belt state [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=159.8s)]
*  Yep, and it shows that you know, she has made up the deficit that Joe Biden was in [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=163.36s)]
*  She's actually leading Donald Trump by one or two in all the states except with Carolina where he is ahead by a whisker [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=169.08s)]
*  So she's that's why she's in Georgia [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  She's gonna be in Savannah and one of the things that governor Brian Kemp told Trump is that you cannot get to 270 electoral votes without [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=178.08s)]
*  Georgia right so you can imagine now because Trump was running away with Georgia under Biden [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=185.48s)]
*  So now she has figured out a way to do that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=189.64s)]
*  I don't think North Carolina is as close as some people believe I think instead of winning by five [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  Maybe Trump wins by two. Okay, that would be difference [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=197.44s)]
*  But one of the things that she has done and a lot of the other states and including house races [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  Is she has helped the down ballot ticket as well. So now we've got ourselves a race [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=204.76s)]
*  And I think everything gets harder for Kamala Harris [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=208.56s)]
*  Starting tonight [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=212.44000000000003s)]
*  Numbers changing in Georgia because the black the female black vote is is really well [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=213.4s)]
*  I said like the enthusiasm gap young people. There's a lot of young people in Atlanta [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  They were like I could they could not take Joe Biden for another second [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=221.68s)]
*  She isn't right made them more enthusiastic Republicans is struggling in the Senate in Nevada and they're struggling in Arizona [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=225.0s)]
*  No Senate seats. Well, you know, we've had so much to talk about today [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4G9AvobMmc&t=230.76000000000002s)]
