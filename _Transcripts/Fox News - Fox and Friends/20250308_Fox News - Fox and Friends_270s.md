# Kevin O’Leary: This is a ‘signal’ for crypto
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU)
*  President Trump hosting the first ever White House crypto summit vowing to stop the government's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=0.0s)]
*  war on a valuable asset. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=7.5s)]
*  Last year I promised to make America the bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=10.84s)]
*  of the planet and we're taking historic action to deliver on that promise as you know around [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=16.72s)]
*  the table. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday I signed an executive order officially creating our strategic bitcoin reserve and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=23.64s)]
*  this will be a virtual Fort Knox for digital gold to be housed within the United States [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  treasury. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=36.4s)]
*  That's a big thing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=37.4s)]
*  Here to discuss Kevin O'Leary, chairman of O'Leary Ventures. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=41.44s)]
*  Kevin, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=45.08s)]
*  Can you just explain what this means? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=48.32s)]
*  This is a big deal to have a strategic bitcoin reserve. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=50.48s)]
*  Why is it so important and why didn't the previous administration do something like this? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=55.04s)]
*  The most important part of this whole announcement and Friday itself was signaling that the regulatory [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=60.76s)]
*  environment is going to change on all things crypto. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=67.6s)]
*  As you know the last administration under Gensler at the SEC, the way policy was being [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=70.38s)]
*  administered was through litigation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=75.06s)]
*  Trying to interpret the existing laws into the new technologies of bitcoin and all the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=77.76s)]
*  other technologies in crypto and it was a mire of just lawsuits. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=82.2s)]
*  That's changing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=87.0s)]
*  That was the signal. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=88.0s)]
*  The bitcoin reserve is actually more importantly about that but there's 17 billion dollars [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=89.0s)]
*  in it right now that's been seized. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=93.72s)]
*  What is being signaled by President Trump is that that's going to be kept by treasury [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=96.44s)]
*  as an asset and he's not adding to it right now but that and a lot of the industry wanted [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=99.94s)]
*  to see some percentage of assets kept in bitcoin but that's not as important as what he did [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=105.48s)]
*  in signaling regulation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  That's stack number one. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  Number two and this was very important is that we have been debating the American dollar [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  and digitizing the American dollar now for almost five years. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=120.76s)]
*  One act was from Jill DeBrant called the stablecoin act and more recently the genius act with [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=124.4s)]
*  Senator Haggerty. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  These acts are going to merge. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=131.56s)]
*  They're going to be co-authored and digitize the American dollar is probably the most important [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=133.36s)]
*  and largest aspect of crypto we could do because every commodity on earth is denominated by [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=138.72000000000003s)]
*  the American dollar. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  We don't want the Russians and the Chinese and the North Koreans and South American countries [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=144.34s)]
*  trying to come up with an alternative which they are talking about. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=149.28s)]
*  We want the dollar to rule and this is how you start. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  It's the largest market. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=156.36s)]
*  It's a multi trillion dollar market and this is the lowest hanging fruit bipartisan bill [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  going to be hitting the floor soon. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=162.7s)]
*  I totally support it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=164.62s)]
*  Real action was not on Friday. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=166.56s)]
*  It was Thursday night in dinners being held all over town by all these crypto people from [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=168.0s)]
*  around the world coming into Washington. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=173.54s)]
*  I went there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  That's the signal I got. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=176.68s)]
*  So go Jill go Jill DeBrant go Haggerty merge it together get it through lots of opposition [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  from Elizabeth Warren on this one but I think her party is going to abandon her on it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=183.45999999999998s)]
*  We want the American dollar digitized. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah this is very important. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=189.5s)]
*  What do you say Kevin. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=191.7s)]
*  Very quickly to investors out there. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=192.85999999999999s)]
*  Is this a good time to invest in cryptocurrency. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=194.54s)]
*  You know cryptocurrency should be thought of in two buckets. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=198.89999999999998s)]
*  One you have speculation in the price of Bitcoin. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=202.14s)]
*  Everybody's been tracking that from 16000 to over 100000 and down 10 percent a day. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=204.78s)]
*  You need a lot of fortitude. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=210.33999999999997s)]
*  You need a stomach to handle that but it should not be your entire portfolio. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=212.26s)]
*  It's no different than owning gold. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=215.73999999999998s)]
*  I own a 5 percent weighting in gold in my portfolios and I own a 5 percent weighting [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=217.06s)]
*  in crypto. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=222.1s)]
*  They both done very very well over the last year and been hedges against inflation which [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=223.1s)]
*  is not bad. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=226.82s)]
*  But what we're really talking about and what the president is signaling here is let's bring [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=228.3s)]
*  the people who develop these technologies back to the United States because we've chased [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=233.6s)]
*  them out through litigation. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=237.78s)]
*  And so he signaled to them come home. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=239.32s)]
*  Let's develop digital payment systems like we talked about digitizing the American dollar [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  because that's a great idea. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=246.88s)]
*  It's a signal and it's powerful and the world hears it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=248.6s)]
*  The world hears it and we're excited. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=252.04s)]
*  It's an exciting time. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=254.2s)]
*  And Kevin O'Leary thank you so much for your insights to this today. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=255.64s)]
*  Take care. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmIQ0wKEkKU&t=259.72s)]
