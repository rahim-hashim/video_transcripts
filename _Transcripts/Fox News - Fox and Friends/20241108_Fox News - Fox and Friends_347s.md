# Trump transition: Big names floated for new cabinet
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ)
*  Starting to take shape, President-elect Trump has appointed Suzy Wiles to be his new White [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=0.0s)]
*  House Chief of Staff, first woman to hold the title. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=5.72s)]
*  Very impressive resume, as you can see right behind me. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=8.38s)]
*  You got her running the campaign from A to Z. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=10.84s)]
*  She's also a longtime Florida-based Republican strategist, knows the area, also knows Washington. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=13.36s)]
*  As for the other cabinet members, you got Secretary of State, you have these finalists [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  here. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=23.52s)]
*  You got Haggerty, Rubio, and Rick Grinnell. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=24.52s)]
*  Rubio's in a Senate seat that could easily be replaced by a Republican governor. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=26.479999999999997s)]
*  Bill Haggerty is also in a positive spot there. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=31.0s)]
*  Also Secretary of Defense, Mike Walz, Mike Pompeo. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=33.68s)]
*  Mike Pompeo already had two positions. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=36.96s)]
*  Secretary of State, excuse me, Congressman Mike Walz, big military background, also served [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=39.48s)]
*  with Dick Cheney as an advisor to him. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=43.36s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolfs had a job as acting, and Tom Holman could certainly [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=46.84s)]
*  do it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=52.04s)]
*  He was ICE director. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  And on the other side, a very key position, you have Attorney General Mike Lee Ken Paxson. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  Or could be there you see somebody on the outside, someone that took on Leticia James [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=59.28s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=63.6s)]
*  And then of course Department of Energy, the name that keeps popping up is someone from [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=64.6s)]
*  an energy-rich state, and that is Governor Doug Burgum, who as almost was the running [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=67.56s)]
*  mate and was certainly a finalist there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=73.44s)]
*  Governor, welcome. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=76.28s)]
*  Your thoughts about being recommended for so many different positions with the Trump [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=78.12s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=83.28s)]
*  Well, Brian, I think the first place to start is just to celebrate this historic win by [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=84.28s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=89.48s)]
*  Under Biden and Harris, we had drawn our country into two proxy wars, one with Russia, one [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=91.28s)]
*  with Iran, and also a cold war with China. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=98.56s)]
*  And now it's only been 48 hours. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=100.92s)]
*  President Trump, the world is preparing for peace. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=103.64s)]
*  We've got a new sheriff in town and President Trump's policies, whether it's maximum pressure [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=105.72s)]
*  on Iran, whether it's making sure that America is going to be dominant in energy, which is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=111.28s)]
*  key to all the diplomacy we do with every country in the world. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=117.48s)]
*  This is game changing already. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=121.44s)]
*  So very exciting time. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=122.92s)]
*  And I said these policies are going to lift up for everybody. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=124.4s)]
*  If you're a Democrat, independent Republican, doesn't matter whether you voted for President [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=127.28s)]
*  Trump or not, you're going to benefit from these policies of having a safer world, a [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=131.36s)]
*  safer border and a stronger U.S. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=135.72000000000003s)]
*  And so very exciting time. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=138.04000000000002s)]
*  And people are flocking the talent that is showing up. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=139.8s)]
*  What's very different than 2016 when President Trump won unexpectedly. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=143.24s)]
*  I mean, now, you know, every position he has, there's 20 qualified people banging on the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=148.4s)]
*  door wanting to get a job. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  And I know that President Trump and his team, fantastic choice with Suzy Wiles. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=154.88000000000002s)]
*  They're going to have the pick of the litter and putting together a fantastic team to help [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  drive our country forward. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=163.08s)]
*  So there's a couple of things. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  People look at North Dakota. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  They know you have this tech center expertise, too. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  You know Silicon Valley inside now. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=168.8s)]
*  You made a lot of your wealth there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=170.84s)]
*  But then they look at North Dakota and they see how oil rich and energy rich it is. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=172.16000000000003s)]
*  They're in the nation for crude oil production and natural gas leader and exporting 82 percent [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  of its natural gas out of the states. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  Home to the world's largest known Lignite deposit and seventh largest coal producing [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=183.44s)]
*  state. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=189.72s)]
*  So people think naturally energy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=190.72s)]
*  But I also noticed you've been doing a lot of traveling international. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=191.72s)]
*  You have a lot of international contacts. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=195.12s)]
*  What's that been like? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=197.44s)]
*  And how does that how does that possibly change your thought process? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=198.44s)]
*  Well, Brian, as you know, President Trump and I were both outsiders, both business guys. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=202.56s)]
*  We both got elected for the first time in the public office back in November of 2016. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=206.68s)]
*  And that perspective, I mean, my spending 25 years building global companies had people [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=213.12s)]
*  working for me in all over the world. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=218.84s)]
*  One of the things that I understand right now is that in addition to the global competition [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=221.6s)]
*  we have between great powers, people President Trump understands everybody wants access to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=227.0s)]
*  our markets. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  They're going to be such a powerful, soft diplomacy tool. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  President Trump also understands that we're in a A.I. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=239.32s)]
*  arms race with China and to have A.I. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  for us to win that arms race, which affects every job, every industry, affects defense. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=245.2s)]
*  We've got to have more electricity. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=250.32s)]
*  He understands that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=251.84s)]
*  And so the combination, I think so I had a chance to be in Israel just over four weeks [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=253.22s)]
*  ago, meeting with President Netanyahu. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=256.96s)]
*  Two weeks ago, I was in South Korea with President Yun. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=259.2s)]
*  I can tell you, world leaders are excited about President Trump being back in office [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=262.16s)]
*  because they know that the policies are going to support allies and we're going to have [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=267.2s)]
*  maximum pressure on our adversaries. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=271.6s)]
*  It was just the opposite under Biden and Harris, who are still running the old tired Obama [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=273.6s)]
*  playbook of appeasement with Iran. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=278.56s)]
*  So it's a fantastic new day in terms of foreign policy. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=280.48s)]
*  And I can tell you firsthand, our allies are excited about having President Trump back [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=283.88s)]
*  in office. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=288.36s)]
*  Did you talk to President Trump about anything about the positions you might be interested [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=289.36s)]
*  in that maybe the audience here at home would like to know? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=292.92s)]
*  Well, I had an opportunity to be with him in Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night on that historic [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=297.04s)]
*  night. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  I had an opportunity to be with him at midnight that morning in Grand Rapids when he took [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  the stage at midnight for his fourth rally of the day, two hours he was on stage. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=306.72s)]
*  That you know, people just need to understand that there isn't anybody that works harder [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=313.48s)]
*  than President Trump. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=317.24s)]
*  He's working for the American people, just an incredible once in a lifetime figure. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=318.91999999999996s)]
*  One has to serve you will and your Achilles is better. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=323.84s)]
*  So you can't even say you'd have to limp through it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=326.32s)]
*  You're 100% now. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=328.28s)]
*  Governor Burgum, thanks so much. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=329.84s)]
*  Best of luck in the position you're most likely going to be offered. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=331.24s)]
*  Hopefully it's something that you want. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  Governor Burgum, thank you. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq-WBfw1iQ&t=335.35999999999996s)]
