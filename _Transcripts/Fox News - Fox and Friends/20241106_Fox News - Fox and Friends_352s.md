**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY)
*  Coming up on 730 here in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=0.0s)]
*  East, Republicans have seized [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=5.5s)]
*  control of the U.S. Senate after [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=7.0s)]
*  four years of Democratic control. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=9.0s)]
*  It started in West Virginia where [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=11.0s)]
*  a Democrat-turned-Republican Jim [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=13.0s)]
*  Justice flipped outgoing [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=15.0s)]
*  Democratic incumbent Senator Joe [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=17.0s)]
*  Manchin's seat. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=19.0s)]
*  It is now red. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=20.0s)]
*  Then a major upset in Ohio, far [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=21.0s)]
*  left incumbent Senator Sherard [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=23.0s)]
*  Brown losing to Trump-backed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=25.0s)]
*  businessman Bernie Moreno. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=27.0s)]
*  But it doesn't end there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=29.0s)]
*  In Montana, any minute now, a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=30.0s)]
*  decision could be announced in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=32.0s)]
*  the very tight race between [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=33.0s)]
*  third-term Democratic Senator [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=35.0s)]

*  Sheehy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=42.0s)]
*  Sheehy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=43.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=44.0s)]
*  And in Pennsylvania, voters are [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=45.0s)]
*  still being counted in the tight [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=46.0s)]
*  race between incumbent [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=48.0s)]

*  McCormick. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=52.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's 97%. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=53.0s)]
*  Sheehy's up by a lot. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=54.0s)]
*  In fellow Blue Wall State, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=56.0s)]
*  Michigan, where we're still [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=57.0s)]
*  waiting for results in the race [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=58.0s)]
*  between Republican Congressman [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=60.0s)]
*  Mike Rogers, who's up, and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=61.0s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Alisa [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=63.0s)]
*  Slotkin, who's running as almost [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=65.0s)]
*  a Trump fan. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=67.0s)]
*  And in Wisconsin, Republican [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=68.0s)]
*  Eric Huvdy is just behind [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=70.0s)]
*  Democratic incumbent Tammy [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=72.0s)]
*  Baldwin. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=73.0s)]
*  Things could reverse there or [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=74.0s)]
*  not. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=75.0s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=76.0s)]
*  those crucial races and when [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=77.0s)]
*  they could come in. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=78.0s)]
*  Former House Speaker Kevin [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=79.0s)]
*  McCarthy has tapped in as anyone. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=80.0s)]
*  You gave millions of dollars to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=82.0s)]
*  make sure Republicans did well. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=83.0s)]
*  I'm sure they appreciate it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=85.0s)]
*  Your thoughts on the race? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=86.0s)]
*  Your thoughts first off about [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=87.0s)]
*  the night overall, the biggest [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=90.0s)]
*  surprise for you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=92.0s)]
*  We talked on the radio for a [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=93.0s)]
*  half hour. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=94.0s)]
*  You looked at all scenarios. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=95.0s)]
*  This to me is such a decisive [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=96.0s)]
*  win. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=98.0s)]
*  I think it even caught Trump's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=99.0s)]
*  supporters by surprise. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=100.0s)]
*  It did. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=101.0s)]
*  And you know, for America, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=102.0s)]
*  regardless where you are, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=103.0s)]
*  President Trump has won the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=105.0s)]
*  Electoral College not even close [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=106.0s)]
*  and the popular vote. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=108.0s)]
*  The other big thing you're going [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=110.0s)]
*  to see is he pulled the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=111.0s)]
*  Republicans across in the Senate [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=113.0s)]
*  in a much larger number than [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=114.0s)]
*  anybody thought. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=116.0s)]
*  Coaches. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=117.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=118.0s)]
*  Because when you carry it like [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=119.0s)]
*  Montana by more than 10 points, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=120.0s)]
*  you bring someone when you carry [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=122.0s)]
*  Ohio, when you carry [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=123.0s)]
*  Pennsylvania, when you carry [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=124.0s)]
*  Wisconsin. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=126.0s)]
*  But he's going to do that in the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=127.0s)]
*  House. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=128.0s)]
*  We're going to keep the House. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=129.0s)]
*  We wouldn't if it wasn't for [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=130.0s)]
*  President. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=131.0s)]
*  So it's two New York seats. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=132.0s)]
*  Yeah, because remember you had [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=133.0s)]
*  redistricting in North Carolina. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=134.0s)]
*  So we automatically got three [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=136.0s)]
*  more to start with. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=137.0s)]
*  It is a better climate for us to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=138.0s)]
*  win in the House this cycle than [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=140.0s)]
*  it was the last two cycles. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=142.0s)]
*  And if you watch like Nebraska [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=143.0s)]
*  Bakins back up, I mean, we in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=145.0s)]
*  Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, seven [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=148.0s)]
*  and eight Cartwright and Wild [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=150.0s)]
*  defeated those two Democrats. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=151.0s)]
*  Slotkin's old seat in Michigan. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=153.0s)]
*  You saw Tom Barrett when there [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=155.0s)]
*  were still Maine hasn't been [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=156.0s)]
*  decided yet. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=158.0s)]
*  California seats, they're going [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=159.0s)]
*  to be coming back up. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=160.0s)]
*  And Trump was carrying so much [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=162.0s)]
*  better this cycle. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=164.0s)]
*  His numbers are higher today [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=165.0s)]
*  than at any time when he was [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=167.0s)]
*  president. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=168.0s)]
*  Is it because of Mr. Speaker, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=169.0s)]
*  this new coalition? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=170.0s)]
*  I mean, these numbers are [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=172.0s)]
*  incredible, almost doubling the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=173.0s)]
*  black vote when it comes to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=174.0s)]
*  Latinos doing almost the same [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=175.0s)]
*  thing right there. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=177.0s)]
*  I mean, all these demographics [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=178.0s)]
*  that are typically pretty [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=180.0s)]
*  progressive are now supporting [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=182.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=184.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=185.0s)]
*  The thing that people should have [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=186.0s)]
*  looked at, he was always carrying [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=187.0s)]
*  41 percent of the Hispanics and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=189.0s)]
*  25 percent of the black males. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=191.0s)]
*  Mathematically, I don't know [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=194.0s)]
*  what you're saying, but we need [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=195.0s)]
*  to take this moment as [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=197.0s)]
*  Republicans and not waste it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=198.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=200.0s)]
*  It should be about addition, not [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=201.0s)]
*  subtraction. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=202.0s)]
*  Welcoming more people into the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=203.0s)]
*  party. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=204.0s)]
*  But what you need to do is do [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=205.0s)]
*  your job because you are given [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=206.0s)]
*  an opportunity here. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=208.0s)]
*  Because of the rules in the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=209.0s)]
*  House and the Senate, you have [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=210.0s)]
*  what is called reconciliation, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=211.0s)]
*  which it takes 60 votes to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=213.0s)]
*  really do something in the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=215.0s)]
*  Senate. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=216.0s)]
*  But you can use reconciliation [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=217.0s)]
*  when we come to the tax bill. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=218.0s)]
*  You should make sure. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=220.0s)]
*  To renew it from 2018. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=221.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=222.0s)]
*  So the American people actually [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=223.0s)]
*  win. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=224.0s)]
*  And it came down to the issues. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=225.0s)]
*  Think about Kamala Harris spent [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=227.0s)]
*  more than a billion dollars. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=228.0s)]
*  And I still can't name the three [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=230.0s)]
*  things she was going to do. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=231.0s)]
*  If she won. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=232.0s)]
*  That was on purpose. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=233.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=234.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=235.0s)]
*  What is it going forward? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=236.0s)]
*  What does it look like the next [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=237.0s)]
*  few months? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=238.0s)]
*  The lame duck months? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=239.0s)]
*  And then what does it look like [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=240.0s)]
*  when Donald takes office? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=241.0s)]
*  What happens to the economy? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=242.0s)]
*  That's why most people voted for [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=243.0s)]
*  him. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=244.0s)]
*  Well, you're going to see the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=245.0s)]
*  market up high because what they [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=246.0s)]
*  realize is regulations are going [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=247.0s)]
*  to come down. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=249.0s)]
*  We're going to unshackle you and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=250.0s)]
*  you're going to be able to invest [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=251.0s)]
*  in America. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=252.0s)]
*  You're going to get a secure [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=253.0s)]
*  border. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=254.0s)]
*  So your feeling of being safe is [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=255.0s)]
*  going to be different. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=256.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=257.0s)]
*  And what's really going to happen [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=258.0s)]
*  and what Republicans are going [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=259.0s)]
*  to do is they're going to be [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=260.0s)]
*  able to get a deal with the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=261.0s)]
*  government. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=262.0s)]
*  And what Republicans should do [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=263.0s)]
*  right now is clean everything [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=264.0s)]
*  out. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=266.0s)]
*  So the president Trump doesn't [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=267.0s)]
*  walk into office and have to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=268.0s)]
*  deal with this year's problem. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=270.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=271.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=272.0s)]
*  They haven't finished the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=273.0s)]
*  funding for this year. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=274.0s)]
*  They should get rid of the debt [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=275.0s)]
*  ceiling because you want to give [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=277.0s)]
*  him a honeymoon to let him [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=279.0s)]
*  govern. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=281.0s)]
*  We're going to keep the house so [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=282.0s)]
*  it's not how King Jeffries [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=283.0s)]
*  trying to impeach him for the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=284.0s)]
*  first time being president. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=286.0s)]
*  The last term he wasn't given [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=288.0s)]
*  the ability to really do the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=290.0s)]
*  job that he could. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=291.0s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=292.0s)]
*  He's better at it today. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=293.0s)]
*  He has the 10000 hours. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=294.0s)]
*  Mr. He knows what to do. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=296.0s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, real quickly. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=297.0s)]
*  The Democrats are already [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=298.0s)]
*  starting the blame game. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=299.0s)]
*  The blame starts with Joe Biden. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=301.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=303.0s)]
*  Joe Biden never should have ran [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=304.0s)]
*  for. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=305.0s)]
*  I knew it when I sat with him. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=306.0s)]
*  There was something wrong with [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=307.0s)]
*  him. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=308.0s)]
*  And Kamala Harris was in the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=309.0s)]
*  room and she lied. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=310.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=311.0s)]
*  When I would tell some she would [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=312.0s)]
*  lie. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=313.0s)]
*  Secondly, you got to blame Nancy [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=314.0s)]
*  Pelosi. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=315.0s)]
*  Remember the celebration when she [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=316.0s)]
*  went around democracy and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=317.0s)]
*  said, I don't care if people [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=318.0s)]
*  picked you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=319.0s)]
*  I'm going to pick somebody else. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=320.0s)]
*  They didn't have a primary. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=321.0s)]
*  And then the very first decision [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=322.0s)]
*  that Kamala Harris made was the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=324.0s)]
*  wrong decision. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=325.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=326.0s)]
*  She picked Tim Walz instead of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=327.0s)]
*  picking Shapiro. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=328.0s)]
*  And a lot of that goes on. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH0a24jszrY&t=329.0s)]
