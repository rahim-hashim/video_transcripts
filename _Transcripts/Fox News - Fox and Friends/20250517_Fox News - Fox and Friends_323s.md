# EPA tackling ‘forever chemicals’ in US drinking water
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64)
*  President Trump's Environmental Protection Agency putting Biden policies under the microscope, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=0.0s)]
*  especially when it comes to our drinking water. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=6.72s)]
*  The EPA announced it will review some strict Biden-era regulations on forever chemicals [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=9.44s)]
*  which remain in the body when ingested. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=14.8s)]
*  Trump officials are also looking to ensure water safety while cutting the cost of those [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=17.84s)]
*  regulations, estimated at $1.5 billion a year. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=22.32s)]
*  EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin joins us right now to help explain this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=28.2s)]
*  It's good to see you, Mr. Administrator. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=32.04s)]
*  Let's just start with this. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  Forever chemicals. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  It sounds a little scary. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Define that term for us. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=39.6s)]
*  Some people try to paint with one broad brush all of these PFAS chemicals, but we shouldn't. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=44.14s)]
*  And the research is ongoing where PFOA and PFOS are examples of two of these chemicals [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=52.08s)]
*  where the research, the data is a lot more further along than some of the other chemicals [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=59.64s)]
*  that are being researched. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=65.5s)]
*  And it's showing there are a lot of studies out there that show that these are cancer-causing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=66.96s)]
*  chemicals. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=72.36s)]
*  There is currently a regulation, a standard that was set of something called four parts [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=73.36s)]
*  per trillion, which we're going to keep. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=78.16s)]
*  What we're hearing from these local drinking water systems is that they need a bit more [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=81.16000000000001s)]
*  time in order to come into compliance. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=85.12s)]
*  And we're going to help work with them and provide the technical assistance. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  The other piece of it is that we don't think that American consumers should have to pay [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=92.04s)]
*  to clean up their own water. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=97.30000000000001s)]
*  And under the current system, that's how this is going to end up playing out. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=99.28s)]
*  Now there's other chemicals that fall under this PFAS that the Biden administration, the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=103.04s)]
*  Biden EPA skipped some steps in the rulemaking process, which causes some legal concerns, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=109.08s)]
*  and we're going to have to go back and fix it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=114.28s)]
*  That was also part of this week's announcement. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  So explain, should we be worried about our drinking water? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=118.56s)]
*  Well, it depends. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=121.64s)]
*  It depends where you live. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=124.44s)]
*  Not all drinking water across this country is equal. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=125.92s)]
*  However, all across the country, most Americans have pristine, great water. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=128.52s)]
*  There are drinking water systems, though, that are showing up at more than the four [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=136.32s)]
*  parts per trillion. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=141.56s)]
*  Now we have to work with these local drinking water systems to help them get into compliance. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  But here's more good news. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=147.84s)]
*  And there is good news while we're talking about addressing the PFOA and PFAS, the PFOA [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  and the PFOA, is that there are companies that are developing new technologies to be [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  able to clean this out of the drinking water systems. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=161.16s)]
*  This has been around for a really long time. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  I represent the congressional district that had a whole bunch of these issues, legacy, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  long-term contamination, firefighting foam that was used, going back decades. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=172.04s)]
*  A lot of drinking water systems are already cleaning it up. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=176.92s)]
*  So even though I put out my announcement this week, for example, the Suffolk County Drinking [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  Water Authority, which is where I live, that's my home on the east end of Long Island, they're [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=184.32s)]
*  moving forward with cleaning up their drinking water to hit that standard. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=189.32s)]
*  So kudos to them. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=194.2s)]
*  And I would encourage these drinking water systems to look at these new technologies [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  that are out there to hopefully clean up at a cheaper cost. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=199.76s)]
*  So it's interesting, as bureaucrats in government and the EPA has for a long time neglected [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=202.83999999999997s)]
*  those serious issues, they have been busy forcing people to put these, buy cars with [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=207.83999999999997s)]
*  this automatic start and stop switch so that every time they come to a stoplight, the car [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=214.32s)]
*  shuts off and then has to restart. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=219.45999999999998s)]
*  You've recognized that this is idiotic, it does nothing for the environment and everybody [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=221.88s)]
*  hates it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=226.44s)]
*  What are you going to do about it? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=227.44s)]
*  The Obama EPA in 2012 created this off-cycle credit to incentivize these car manufacturers [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=230.88s)]
*  to add this feature to vehicles which so many Americans absolutely hate. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=238.16s)]
*  Leave it to the federal government 13 years ago to go out of their way to get this in [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=243.24s)]
*  more vehicles. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=248.76s)]
*  I've experienced myself, but I've heard from so many other people how frustrated they are [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=250.36s)]
*  that they go to a red light, their car stops, they go to the next light, their car stops [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=253.84s)]
*  again. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=259.68s)]
*  And they might have some feature that allows them to turn it off, but they're wondering [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=260.68s)]
*  why the heck do I have to turn this feature off every time I'm starting my car? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=264.12s)]
*  They're scratching their head wondering why haven't we hit the point where I could just [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=268.72s)]
*  choose to turn it off once and every time I start my car it just stays off. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=271.64s)]
*  A lot of people are wondering what kind of impact does this have on their engine, on [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=277.36s)]
*  their starter, how much does it really save in gas, but despite all of that the American [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  public is demanding that the Trump EPA take this action so we're going to take it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=287.4s)]
*  I think if you do it man you're going to be the most popular guy in the country because [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=292.6s)]
*  we hate it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=296.68s)]
*  This is the perfect encapsulation of the federal government, not only because it's tax incentives, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=297.68s)]
*  not only do people hate it and they don't want it, but they also have to pay for it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=302.56s)]
*  And so I'm so glad that you're finally addressing it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=307.6s)]
*  Lee Zeldin, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdZC3npu64&t=310.44s)]
