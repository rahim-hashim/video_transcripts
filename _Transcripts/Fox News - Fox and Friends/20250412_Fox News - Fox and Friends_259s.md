# ‘Good riddance’: Noem praises judge’s decision on Mahmoud Khalil
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZF3QlLP_DI)
*  Big win for the Trump administration after an immigration judge on Friday rules Mahmoud Khalil can be deported over his involvement leading last year's anti-Israel protest just up the road here at Columbia University. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZF3QlLP_DI&t=0.0s)]
*  The DHS secretary Kristi Noem welcoming the decision saying Friday quote when you advocate for violence glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans and harassed Jews you should not be in this country adding good riddance. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZF3QlLP_DI&t=14.0s)]
*  Here to react former federal prosecutor Nima Ramani and so the ruling here what should we know about this Nima and how long is the appeal process going to go and where from here does this lead us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZF3QlLP_DI&t=33.0s)]
*  Clay there's two cases here and what we're talking about is immigration court in Louisiana and there the judge ruled that under section 237 and the immigration and nationality act the secretary of state here Marco Rubio can remove a green card holder if he reasonably believes that they're going to harm American foreign policy interests. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZF3QlLP_DI&t=47.0s)]
*  That's what happened here and then the judge also didn't need to rule in the second issue which was whether Khalil committed fraud during the naturalization process when he applied for that green card so you know I know there are a lot of folks that think he's a terrorist others who believe that he's being persecuted for exercising his free speech rights but the immigration judge can't really consider that that's not something within the scope of their authority so there's another case that's pending. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZF3QlLP_DI&t=68.0s)]
*  In New Jersey and there potentially a district judge can address any first amendment issues. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZF3QlLP_DI&t=98.0s)]
*  Okay that's one story that's out there breaking on Friday we also have a new story for a new generation I should say based partly on what's happened with the Netflix documentary we've got a decision in the Menendez brothers trial they were convicted of murder in 1989 now there's some discussion about whether or not they can be given any sort of freedom here what's going on there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZF3QlLP_DI&t=104.0s)]
*  So we're talking about the resentencing petition and here's what happened there was a former district attorney here in Los Angeles where I live named George Gaston and he initiated a resentencing request that's very important because under California law that's not something the defense can do only the prosecution or a judge can do so. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZF3QlLP_DI&t=127.0s)]
*  He was perceived rightfully so as being soft on crime so LA elected a new district attorney Nathan Hockman well now he's taken over and he wanted to pull back that sentencing recommendation and the judge had to decide well can this even proceed and go forward and I know Nathan I respect him I used to work with him but it was really too late the judge said the train has already left the station so next week the judge is going to actually hear that and he's going to be like oh my gosh I'm going to be in trouble. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZF3QlLP_DI&t=148.0s)]
*  So next week the judge is going to actually hear that resentencing request and if the Menendez brothers are resentenced to something less than life without the possibility of parole there's a real chance that you know they'll go before the parole board and they may be released in a matter of months. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZF3QlLP_DI&t=175.0s)]
*  This is completely a reaction I think it's fair to say to the Netflix documentary which we've seen happen a lot where they go back over old cases new generations are exposed to them and we get a new results that fair to say. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZF3QlLP_DI&t=193.0s)]
*  Oh absolutely clay we've seen it time and time again the power of the Netflix series obviously we're talking about monsters but there's many many other cases whether it's Britney Spears or Kelly you know Robert Durst the Abercrombie and Finch CEO where you know you have a documentary or docu series and it completely changes the course of a legal case and here you have two individuals who are convicted of murdering their parents and you have a documentary that really shines on the history of the case. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZF3QlLP_DI&t=204.0s)]
*  And you have a documentary that really shines light on the sexual abuse that they suffer the hands of their father Jose and their mother either turn a blind eye or was complicit to it so now all of a sudden you have two convicted murderers who have a lot of support as victims of sex abuse so I wouldn't be surprised if they are ultimately released. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZF3QlLP_DI&t=231.0s)]
