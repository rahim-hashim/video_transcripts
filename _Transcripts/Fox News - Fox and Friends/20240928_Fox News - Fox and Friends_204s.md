# This is an ‘absolute abuse of authority’: GOP rep
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY)
*  All right, we're back with Congressman and Dr. Greg Murphy here on Fox and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=0.0s)]
*  France. Good morning again, Congressman. Hopefully we got our technology worked [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=4.38s)]
*  out here together. They were talking about D. I. In medicine and how many [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=7.66s)]
*  medical schools have relegated actual medicine below the goals of D. I. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=11.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know, when I was working with some colleagues back at my alma mater [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=16.8s)]
*  at Davidson College, we saw how First Amendment rights were not being [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=21.92s)]
*  respected. And this is the basically the succession of this now to graduate [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=25.44s)]
*  school, the medical school and literally in literally the worst profession. I [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  believe it can happen. You're seeing D. I. Now being professed in the abuse of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=34.92s)]
*  authority positions, not only in the Med Cat in curriculum to having to sign [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=39.6s)]
*  fealty oaths to D. I. Diversity culture professions that go on through medical [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=44.92s)]
*  school. Remember, so many of these students want to be a certain type of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=50.88s)]
*  physician or a surgeon, which takes good grades. And so unless you profess the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=55.24s)]
*  ideology that these schools are professing the liberal progressive [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  ideology, you very well could have your grades hurt. So it's an absolute abuse [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  of authority. We need to get politics out of medical school and get medicine [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=68.2s)]
*  and the care of every single patient back in. Well, let's give one example. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=72.76s)]
*  This is from the I can School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. This is a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=76.68s)]
*  course description. Intro to anesthesiology course is intended, quote, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=79.92s)]
*  to provide students with a space for building critical thinking and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=84.56s)]
*  community around social justice work. Here's another one. This is from [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=87.36s)]
*  Harvard. This is another course description for integrated human [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=92.88s)]
*  pathophysiology. It reads content that explores health equity, anatomy, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=97.0s)]
*  climate change, microbiology, pharmacology and pathology is integrated. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=101.76s)]
*  Uh, you know, I'm no medical doctor, but it would seem that, you know, if I'm a [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=107.7s)]
*  patient, I'm not sure I want how climate change. I don't know that I [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=112.2s)]
*  want my doctor informed when I need something specific to my medical [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  condition. Yeah, you know, um, well, I'm a surgeon and what people want from a [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=118.88s)]
*  surgeon is to do the best job for them inside, not to be a social activists, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=123.88s)]
*  not to be someone who cares more about climate change than you do the patient [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  in front of me. And will let me just put something as a caveat. 10 years from [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=133.8s)]
*  now, when these medical students come through and they finish their [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=138.08s)]
*  residency, medicine in the United States is going to be in a horrible position [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=140.64s)]
*  because not only we're going to have a shortage of doctors, which are [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=146.48s)]
*  institutes of medicine are now caring more about social justice than getting [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=149.44s)]
*  good students in medical school, but we're going to have doctors that care [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=153.92s)]
*  more about social activism than they do about taking care of patients. These, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=157.92s)]
*  uh, these culture wars that are occurring at the highest levels of medical [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  education now are going to destroy American medicine in about a decade. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=166.36s)]
*  And the quality of patients in our health care, what we're getting when we [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=171.84s)]
*  talk to a doctor when the cost is scary on an individual basis for us as we [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=175.68s)]
*  visit a doctor. Yeah, you know, I've had a bullseye on my back since we put out [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=180.56s)]
*  the educate act and you know, the pillars of institutional medicine, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=185.4s)]
*  those who control medical schools have put out op ed after op ed attacking me [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=189.0s)]
*  I've dictated my life to taking care of patients that don't look like I do. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=194.32000000000002s)]
*  And the fact that they're now putting progressive liberalism in the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=199.24s)]
*  curriculum is absolutely wrong. Scary. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4QSPHlKMEY&t=201.92000000000002s)]
