# Trumpâ€™s question after thunderous NCAA moment gets all-American response
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA)
*  It was a huge moment, just the fact that President Trump took the time to walk into that arena [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=0.0s)]
*  and just share the love of the sport that he truly cares about. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=5.68s)]
*  Remember, Rich, on 23 he was in Tulsa with me as well. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=10.52s)]
*  My boys now, on 23 they wrestle in high school. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  Today they wrestle at Oklahoma State and OU. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=17.84s)]
*  I got three boys that wrestle in college and it's just something that we truly love the sport. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=21.0s)]
*  And President Trump seems to share our same passion for it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=26.0s)]
*  When the sound of, they say the sound of God came on, the place went absolutely nuts. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=29.6s)]
*  President Trump came walking in, they're chanting USA, USA, USA. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  Elon is there, Elon is getting excited about it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=42.800000000000004s)]
*  You can tell the wrestlers that had already wrestled for, you know, being an All-American from third place all the way down to eighth place, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=47.44s)]
*  they were standing up cheering. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=55.8s)]
*  The president walked over to me and he says, they absolutely love me here, don't you? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  And I said, sir, they do. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=60.64s)]
*  And he says, why do you think that? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=61.72s)]
*  And I said, I said, well, I said, sir, every male in this building, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=63.28s)]
*  and I'd say a lot of females in this building has been punched in the face. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=67.72s)]
*  We're wrestling fans, we do this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=70.92s)]
*  And I said, they respect a fighter and they respect you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=72.84s)]
*  And he just said, yeah, I get that, I get that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=75.8s)]
*  Charlie, he shows every single day that he's for the people and from the people. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=78.36s)]
*  What I mean by that is tell me if Joe Biden could walk in that room and get a chant like that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=83.72000000000001s)]
*  They would have been they've been they've been chanting, you know, I don't know, let's go Brandon. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=89.4s)]
*  But when President Trump walked in there, they were chanting USA because every single day they know that he's up there fighting for him. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=94.92s)]
*  And the iconic part was, unfortunately, in Pennsylvania, when the assassination, the assassin's bullet missed him. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=102.28s)]
*  And yet he stood up and put his hand in the air and said, fight, fight, fight. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=109.92s)]
*  That resonated through everybody. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=113.8s)]
*  And it resonated through the through the patriotism, through our country, too. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=116.56s)]
*  And then you walk into a wrestling arena like that where people just love America. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=120.0s)]
*  They respect a fighter. That's right at President Trump's base. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=125.24s)]
*  And he couldn't have been more at home in that crowd than, let's say, myself or or or any other wrestler that was participating there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=129.56s)]
*  This morning, before I got on your show, Rachel, I was reading last week's wins and they were talking about all the manufacturing come back to the US. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=139.6s)]
*  They were talking about the executive orders that was putting the country back on place. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=147.28s)]
*  They were talking about Audi and Honda announcing they're going to start making manufacturing back here in the United States. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  Talk about the one point four billion dollar investment that UAE is announcing almost immediately going up to one point four trillion. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=159.72s)]
*  You just see that people are investing in the US because they trust the leadership that we have. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=168.16s)]
*  One thing I want to add to is Wyatt Henderson is the heavyweight that you guys are talking about that pulled maybe the largest upset of the NCA. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  He's also a graduate from the Air Force Academy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=181.28s)]
*  And President Trump met him three years ago. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  And Wyatt walked up to him when I was with him and said, can I get a waiver to fly jets? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=188.88s)]
*  And the president looked at him and said, sir, I don't think they make cockpits that big. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=193.6s)]
*  I mean, just a huge individual. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=197.2s)]
*  And they they actually developed a friendship. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=199.0s)]
*  And so President Trump was supposed to leave two matches before Wyatt wrestled. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=201.32s)]
*  And he said he looked at me and he says, I can't leave. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  I got to watch my big guy. That's what he called him. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=208.0s)]
*  He said, I got to watch my big guy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksi_t08roSA&t=210.12s)]
