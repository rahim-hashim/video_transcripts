# 'IT'S UNFAIR': Newsom's reversal shocks conservative host
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE)
*  So it comes as Democratic leaders reportedly scolded some of their own behind closed doors [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=0.0s)]
*  yesterday for their ridiculous behavior at Trump's speech on Tuesday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=4.76s)]
*  Fox News contributor, former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway joins us now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=9.52s)]
*  So Kellyanne, you see them trying to get a bigger presence on social media. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=13.52s)]
*  What kind of starter are they off to? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=16.96s)]
*  Squatty potty videos are no way to rebuild a broken party. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=20.32s)]
*  The Democrats are suffering from an identity crisis, an ideology and a policy prescription [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=25.36s)]
*  crisis. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=30.52s)]
*  Brian, after the election you would have thought they'd go do some town halls and union halls, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=31.52s)]
*  try to reconnect with their moorings. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=36.44s)]
*  A lot of these voters that they shed over to President Trump knowing that what was the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=38.68s)]
*  Obama coalition is now Trump country. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  He's just done so much better among some of these core Democratic constituencies. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  This is no way to connect with voters. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=49.8s)]
*  And this is no way to show that you have actual policies about economic opportunity [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=51.88s)]
*  and prosperity. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  Here's the difference between the two parties. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  And they're both built around Donald Trump. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  The Republican Party is soaring and succeeding and the Democratic Party seems broken down [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=61.84s)]
*  and hollowed out. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=66.04s)]
*  And they also seem very self-centered, besotted with themselves, dancing these videos. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=67.28s)]
*  I think those videos are great for Donald Trump and the Republican Party. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=72.0s)]
*  I think everybody sitting on their hands the other night are, we should be having that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=75.56s)]
*  in our ads for next year. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  But seriously speaking, if the Democrats don't change on policy, then, and they don't [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=81.06s)]
*  break out of what I call unanimity, Republicans have unity, Democrats suffer from unanimity. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=87.66s)]
*  Not a single one of them is for school choice. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  Not a single one is pro-life, pro-Second Amendment. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=94.82000000000001s)]
*  Not a single one voted against the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=97.14s)]
*  Not a single one voted for the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=99.5s)]
*  Not a single one's for D-Wrek. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=101.98s)]
*  Not a single one can stand up for a kid with cancer. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=103.18s)]
*  So when you suffer from unanimity, when Hakeem Jeffries has received every single Democratic [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  vote for speaker in 20 ballots dating back over two years, you suffer, everybody's afraid [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=110.86s)]
*  to go first. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=116.9s)]
*  Now, we're starting to see some cracks and some fraying. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=117.9s)]
*  Gavin Newsom has come out. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=120.22s)]
*  John Fetterman's come out. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=121.42s)]
*  Simone Sanders, a very smart and strategic thinker in the Democratic Party, who I know [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=122.7s)]
*  they should listen to, are coming out and saying, wait a second, some things just don't [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  make any sense, and we can't cast our lot on these issues. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=131.9s)]
*  Again, even an opposition party needs to have something to support. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=135.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=140.18s)]
*  So Gavin Newsom says, now that Los Angeles burned to the ground, what a great time to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=141.18s)]
*  launch a podcast, even though I'm still governor, and says my first interview is going to be [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=144.94s)]
*  with Charlie Kirk. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=149.54000000000002s)]
*  Charlie Kirk kind of reverses it and asks him, you have to agree with me that trans [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=151.06s)]
*  men shouldn't be playing in women's sports. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=156.02s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  You right now should come out and be like, you know what, the young man who's about to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=159.94s)]
*  win the state championship in the long jump in female sports, that shouldn't happen. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=163.78s)]
*  You as the governor should step out and say no. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=168.7s)]
*  No, and I appreciate. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=170.57999999999998s)]
*  But like, would you do something like that? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  Would you say no men in female sports? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=173.33999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think it's an issue of fairness. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=174.78s)]
*  I completely agree with you on that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=176.38s)]
*  So that's easy to call out the unfairness of that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  So he does, and he got a huge blowback, everything from Mayor Lori Lightfoot to Ro Kahana. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=180.98s)]
*  And then Keem Jeffries had some bizarre statement about women's, has to prove they're a woman [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  by, I don't know, some type of exam. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=194.5s)]
*  Your thoughts about this, your thoughts about Gavin Newsom saying that and the blowback [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=198.66000000000003s)]
*  that this party gave him. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=202.06s)]
*  Well, he's invited me on his podcast. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=204.18s)]
*  I look forward to joining him as well. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=206.74s)]
*  And Charlie Kirk, of course, is brilliant. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=208.74s)]
*  He's asking very simple questions that demand common sense answers. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=210.18s)]
*  This is over an 80-20 issue. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=213.86s)]
*  And when Gavin Newsom is breaking with his party, he's basically saying we need to try [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=216.5s)]
*  to go more to the center. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  But I would say respectfully to Governor Newsom, now do sanctuary cities. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  Now do anti-recidivism. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=226.10000000000002s)]
*  Now get rid of the ridiculous EV mandate compliance that you have in your state. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=227.92s)]
*  That's a beautiful state with manmade problems. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=231.88s)]
*  So if he and John Fetterman actually want to bring along a few other dozen Democrats [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  who just exercise common sense, great. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  But I think right now, because of President Trump's great success, that the Democrats [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  seem, they seem cornered and checkmated, Brian. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  So if they're starting to show some little twinings, you just need to align with the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=250.72s)]
*  public. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  You know what's different for President Trump now? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=255.23999999999998s)]
*  The public is aligned with his agenda. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=256.56s)]
*  They trust him on migration and inflation. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=258.42s)]
*  Next month is 10 years since Donald Trump elevated into the national consciousness. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=261.6s)]
*  Ten years, illegal immigration, border security and trade. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=265.88s)]
*  And now most Americans, overwhelming majorities of Americans, agree with President Trump. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=268.82s)]
*  The Democrats have nothing near that on any of their core beliefs. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=276.12s)]
*  Kellyanne, too. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=277.12s)]
*  And if he was sincere, it wouldn't take a Charlie Kirk question. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=278.12s)]
*  It would take him's legislation to stand up and say, I want my state to no longer allow [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=281.6s)]
*  trans men playing in women's sports. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=286.56s)]
*  But instead, it comes out in a casual conversation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=289.56s)]
*  So there's not much behind it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=291.92s)]
*  And that seems to be a lot of the blowback from the right. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=292.92s)]
*  Thanks so much, Kellyanne. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  I'll talk to you soon. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  Good luck on that podcast. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixkESGQrVE&t=297.28000000000003s)]
