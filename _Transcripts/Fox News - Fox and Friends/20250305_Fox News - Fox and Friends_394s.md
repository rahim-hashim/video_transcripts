*  So that means what does that mean? The pause is off. The deal is done [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=202.12s)]
*  We're back to giving aid to Ukraine. But the minerals you want to know the minerals deal that we should have had an amazing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  Signing ceremony was all set right on the wake of Prime Minister Stammer President Macron the NATO [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=216.04s)]
*  Section that was a step towards then [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=223.8s)]
*  negotiations for a ceasefire [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=227.4s)]
*  Negotiations for a broad broader permanent peace deal [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=229.56s)]
*  What we came out of the Oval Office truly questioning last week was would [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=232.96s)]
*  President Zelensky ever deal with the Russians and would he ever bring this war to an end and our point [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=237.84s)]
*  Continuing has been the American people's patience is not on his side. The war effort is not on you know [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=244.60000000000002s)]
*  But we're gonna look worse years from now [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=251.12s)]
*  Look, I just got off the phone [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  On the way here with my counterpart national security advisor. We are talking about a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=256.12s)]
*  location a date [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=262.0s)]
*  negotiating team [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=264.44s)]
*  Yesterday and today was a positive step forward to say we are going to negotiate this piece and we're already talking about confidence-building [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=266.52000000000004s)]
*  Measures that will then take to the Russians and test that side [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=274.36s)]
*  this is gonna be a tough shuttle diplomacy, but both sides have to enter into it and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=278.0s)]
*  You know, that's what Friday put into question. I think we're moving in a positive direction now Michael. Did you? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=283.56s)]
*  When you read this letter and you went over it with the president [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  Did he say got it? This is enough for me to move forward or do you still need more from the Ukrainian said got it? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=293.64s)]
*  Wish we had heard this last week [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=300.14s)]
*  This is a good positive first step and then directed us to get the details of the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=302.34s)]
*  Negotiations and set those in and I'll go back to him today and then see [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=308.14s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=312.5s)]
*  Is there a chance the pause will be lifted because there is a report to that? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=312.98s)]
*  Intelligent sharing is also stopped with Keefe [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=318.3s)]
*  I think if we can nail down these negotiations and move towards these negotiations and in fact put some confidence-building measures on the table [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=320.46s)]
*  Then the president will take a hard look at lifting this pause and then get back on the peace process to try to we have [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=328.78s)]
*  To know that we're we have to know that both sides are sincerely negotiating [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=335.5s)]
*  Towards a a partial than permanent peace, right? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  And you have not seen anything negative from this letter and some from your kind of conversation [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=343.46s)]
*  I have to tell you the conversation this morning was much better than what we've been having the last several days [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=348.26s)]
*  I'll tell you you must have an easy job. You look fresh. Look, I mean you don't know tired. You look great [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=353.58s)]

*  Yeah, I mean the president's ready to do big things and he's not slowing down [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=363.6s)]
*  And by the way, the Wall Street Journal has a story about something you were working on as a congressman [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDPNrSNSLY&t=367.32s)]
