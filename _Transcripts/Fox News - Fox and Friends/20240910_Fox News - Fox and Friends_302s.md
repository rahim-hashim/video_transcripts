*  Israel and the cabinet viewed this footage and they felt it's important for the public to see it and again they do intend on [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  Releasing it later this week. All right. Thanks so much Trey. Appreciate it. That's the latest from Israel [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=131.18s)]
*  Now the latest on the same issue here in America. It's the perfect. Thanks, Brian [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=136.88s)]
*  So today anti Israeli protesters expected in Philadelphia ahead of the ABC presidential debate in the swing state [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=141.06s)]
*  This asked students across America already on edge as protesters called to storm college campuses for a day of action [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=148.54000000000002s)]
*  The next guest a Harvard University graduate now sending this warning to the Democratic Party watch [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=154.9s)]
*  I'm a registered Democrat [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=161.74s)]
*  I've only voted for Democrats a Democratic Party has taken the Jewish vote and Jewish voters for granted for far too long and come [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=163.34s)]
*  This November I will be supporting I will be endorsing and I will be voting for President Trump [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=170.36s)]
*  That man is Shabos Kestenbaum and he joins us right now Shabos [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=177.26000000000002s)]
*  Why that urgent [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=183.22s)]
*  Message to the Democratic Party sure so I really tried being silent for ten months [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=185.14s)]
*  I either tried to appear bipartisan or nonpartisan [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  But the reality is the election is less than what 60 days away from now and we have to make it clear that as Jewish [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  Voters we've been taken for granted for far too long and the issues of anti-semitism on college campuses the issues of releasing the American [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=197.56s)]
*  hostages these are paramount to our community and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=204.3s)]
*  While it is true that Jewish Americans have typically voted for the Democratic Party myself included [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=207.52s)]
*  I registered to vote as a Democrat the day I turned 18 the reality is we need our party to understand that they are not [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=212.36s)]
*  Making the necessary policy [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=218.46s)]
*  Implementations or procedures that would win us over [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  I've had different officials on different representatives and they continue to make the point to me that the party at large [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=224.0s)]
*  Supports the Israeli people the Jewish people, but these are just outliers. What would you say to those people? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=232.8s)]
*  Look, I wish I wish they were right. We know that the squad has tripled in size [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=238.08s)]
*  We know that five years ago ten Democrats skipped Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=242.24s)]
*  Nissen Yahoo's address to Congress this year. He was 110 and they were all Democrats [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=246.0s)]
*  So I wish I could say that this was simply relegated to a small minority [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=250.24s)]
*  But the reality is as I mentioned my speech of the Republican Jewish Coalition last week [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=254.16s)]
*  I [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=258.17999999999995s)]
*  Republicans like the House Ways and Means [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=259.38s)]
*  Chairman Jason Smith or Congresswoman Virginia Fox of the Education Committee [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=261.26s)]
*  They released public letters to university saying what will you do to enforce your policies to combat? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=264.91999999999996s)]
*  Antisemitism and not one Democrat signed off on it now. Look my my congressman is Richie Torres. He's an incredible person [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=270.29999999999995s)]
*  I will continue to vote for him for as long as he runs [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=275.94s)]
*  But there's a reason why Richie Torres and John Fetterman were not at the Democratic National Convention [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=278.21999999999997s)]
*  It's because our party is fundamentally different than the party of just four or five years ago [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=283.2s)]
*  They weren't welcome [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=287.22s)]
*  Exactly. Thank you so much. Thank you. I'm Steve juicy. I'm Brian kill me [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6VwQay1zLo&t=288.86s)]
