# KJP grilled over Hunter Biden pardon: 'Do you owe an apology to the American people?'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w)
*  Back here to domestic politics, we do wonder where the apology is to the American people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=0.0s)]
*  for the lie that we were given for the better part of a year. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=5.0s)]
*  Would you, will you pardon Hunter Biden, Joe Biden? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=9.32s)]
*  That question also asked to Corrine Jean-Pierre. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Of course, we were told the answer was no. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=14.6s)]
*  He would not. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=16.92s)]
*  And now we've seen that pardon. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=17.92s)]
*  So Corrine Jean-Pierre is now being asked whether or not they owe the American people an apology. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=20.8s)]
*  He thought about it and he weighed, it was not an easy decision to come to, and he put [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=27.24s)]
*  out a comprehensive statement. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=35.08s)]
*  And I would certainly offer that up to folks out there who are wondering. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=37.76s)]
*  I would say please read the President's response to this in full. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=43.16s)]
*  I'm sure my colleagues have a few thoughts, just very specifically. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=47.08s)]
*  It's not only colleagues who watch this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=50.0s)]
*  There's also the American people. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=52.2s)]
*  So to be fair. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=53.44s)]
*  And they were told by you in July that this would not happen. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=54.64s)]
*  And it did. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  Do you think asking for yourself, not the President saying it for yourself, do you feel [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  like you owe an apology, an apology by the President? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  I just. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=65.08s)]
*  Do you owe an apology to the American people? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=66.08s)]
*  I just laid out the President's thinking. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=67.08s)]
*  The President laid it out himself in his own words. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=70.4s)]
*  He did. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=73.0s)]
*  He laid out how he wrestled with this decision. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  He said in his statement as a President, as a father, he talked about how difficult it [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=77.12s)]
*  was to make this decision. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=83.92s)]
*  You know, what's infuriating, they don't even acknowledge reality, which is probably [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  a pretty good tactic if, you know, you're just trying to control the news. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=92.48s)]
*  The problem for them, though, is at some point it just becomes delusional. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=96.98s)]
*  She's delusional when she refuses to acknowledge the clear reality of all of her denials. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=100.56s)]
*  Yeah, you know, this, if you look at the timing again, 2000 and the date that he starts the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=107.16s)]
*  pardon from, it's very clear this isn't about pardoning Hunter. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  It's about pardoning Joe Biden. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=119.4s)]
*  It's about pardoning Jill Biden, who also participated in terms of enjoying the largesse [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=121.0s)]
*  that was made from abroad from our China, Ukraine and Russia. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=125.84s)]
*  It includes the grandkids who they were offshore. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=130.8s)]
*  Remember the offshore accounts that were put in the grandkids names. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=132.76s)]
*  So the entire Biden scheme to sell out the country and make money off of Joe Biden's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=135.84s)]
*  position as vice president. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=143.36s)]
*  That's what this was about. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=146.28s)]
*  This was not some selfless father looking out for his crackhead son. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=147.28s)]
*  pardoning the entire family racket and everyone involved in it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=152.78s)]
*  And by the way, we're not done. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=157.82s)]
*  No, I mean, the pardons to come will will in themselves, I believe, be an admission. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=159.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=165.86s)]
*  It won't just be. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=167.9s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=169.42000000000002s)]
*  I mean, and honestly, if I were if I were a betting man, I would bet that that Joe Biden [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  pardons himself before he leaves. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=175.74s)]
*  Well, we actually talked about off camera is also that these pardons, as much as we [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=178.5s)]
*  all hate them and know that it's it's really an admission of what we've always known about [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=185.18s)]
*  what was on that laptop from hell. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=189.34s)]
*  It will make it very easy for Joe for Donald Trump to pardon the January 6 political prisoners. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  Oh, it's the by using the exact same standard. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=198.46s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have to go anything beyond that would actually be different because it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=201.94s)]
*  would be a pardon in the spirit of a pardon, which is specific. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=205.54s)]
*  These are blanket. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  Hunter Biden's pardon is a blanket pardon over an 11 year time for things that we don't [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=211.01999999999998s)]
*  even know. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=216.5s)]
*  Also, also, we do know. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=217.5s)]
*  We know who the big guy is. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=218.5s)]
*  Come on. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=220.54s)]
*  Also, the political activity that went into the investigation of Hunter Biden vastly helped [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=221.54s)]
*  him as opposed to hurt him. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=229.01999999999998s)]
*  It was you know, you had the Secret Service, you had the IRS. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=231.45999999999998s)]
*  You had the FBI. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=235.22s)]
*  You had DOJ. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=236.22s)]
*  Everybody was desperate to try to help Hunter Biden. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=237.22s)]
*  And then it wasn't until that got blown up that he got charged. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=240.98000000000002s)]
*  And whereas it's the exact opposite with the January 6 people, the January 6 people have [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  been pursued, doggedly pursued and persecuted by prosecutors who have a political agenda. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=249.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's like Cuba style stuff that that happened to the people that real quick. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=256.06s)]
*  Charlie, when you were talking, I was just thinking you like she's delusional. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=260.74s)]
*  I'm a cringe on beer. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=263.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=264.82s)]
*  It's it's really fascinating. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=265.82s)]
*  It's very Orwellian to hear her speak. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=268.02s)]
*  And what I'm getting at is here's a specific question. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=270.9s)]
*  Do you apologize to the American people? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=274.02s)]
*  And the answer is the president has given a comprehensive response on refer you back [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=275.85999999999996s)]
*  to that conference as though the president's words crafted in a press release have the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=279.61999999999995s)]
*  authority that is unquestioned and should answer all your questions. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=285.29999999999995s)]
*  It's news. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=289.38s)]
*  It's a specific question that's not addressed in that in that memo. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=290.46s)]
*  I refer you back to dear leaders words. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=293.74s)]
*  I think what's so gross about this entire situation with Hunter and and the families [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=296.94s)]
*  that you remember when JFK said, you know, that's not what what you can do with the country [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=302.34s)]
*  can do for you, what you can do for the country. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=305.9s)]
*  The entire Biden legacy, in my opinion, is about what the government, what these positions [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=307.9s)]
*  can do to help the family. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=313.6s)]
*  And I'll tell you, you'll see a perfect example this coming weekend. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=314.78s)]
*  Jill Biden is taking a solo trip and we know she's going to end up at Notre Dame along [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=318.54s)]
*  with Donald Trump for for the for that sort of grand opening and of of the Notre Dame [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=324.1s)]
*  Cathedral after the renovation. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=328.62s)]
*  But before that, this is a big junket. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=330.1s)]
*  I mean, she's going to four countries, going to UAE, she's going to Italy, she's going [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=333.26000000000005s)]
*  to Qatar, she's going to end up in France. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=337.18s)]
*  Like I wish Doge was on happening right now. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=340.26s)]
*  What purpose could there possibly be other than to waste our money, which they've done [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=343.06s)]
*  and feed off of the American people, which Jill and Joe have done their entire political [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=350.26s)]
*  career? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=355.02s)]
*  Why is Jill Biden going? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=356.02s)]
*  Joe Biden is not going. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=357.02s)]
*  He's not well, probably. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=358.02s)]
*  But there's no purpose in her going maybe to France. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=359.52s)]
*  Maybe you could justify France. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=361.9s)]
*  No need for her to go to all these other things. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=363.1s)]
*  She's on her way out the door. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=364.54s)]
*  Rachel, it's really hard to give up private travel. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=365.54s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=368.26s)]
*  And jets that they don't want that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=369.66s)]
*  Yeah, I can't. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=371.38s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnZTQQlmz2w&t=373.06s)]
