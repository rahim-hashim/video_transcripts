# Trump admin ordered to pay part of $2 billion in foreign aid by today
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg)
*  The Trump administration has until 6 p.m. to pay some of the $2 billion in foreign aid payments to USAID contractors and nonprofits. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=0.0s)]
*  This, after a judge ruled they cannot be blocked despite Trump's executive order to slash $60 billion in foreign aid and spending. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=9.6s)]
*  Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett joins us now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=17.6s)]
*  Greg, it's important for our audience to know how the legal system really dropped the ball here in my view. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  With a district court judge really setting foreign policy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=26.8s)]
*  Yeah, making himself a super president. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=30.0s)]
*  And you know, the Supreme Court Justice Sam Alito accused this district court judge, his name is Amir Ali, of abusing his authority, ignoring the law on sovereign immunity, which is clear. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  And Alito is right. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=47.92s)]
*  You know, the president has vested powers under the Constitution to order executive agencies to freeze money. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=49.04s)]
*  He can do it for reasons of foreign policy, national security, to avoid waste. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=56.6s)]
*  So, you know, this decision by Judge Ali, who, by the way, is a Biden appointee, he's been on the court for a nanosecond, that forces Trump to spend $2 billion is judicial activism. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=62.52s)]
*  Run amok. I think it'll eventually be overturned by the Supreme Court. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=77.0s)]
*  But by then it's too late. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=80.76s)]
*  That, you know, this judge is forcing Trump to pay $2 billion. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=82.56s)]
*  They'll never get that back. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=87.36s)]
*  It is frustrating. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=90.92s)]
*  And the thing is, I just don't think that Amy Coney Barrett really let a lot of people down with her five-four vote. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=92.4s)]
*  And so the other four, it's just ridiculous. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=99.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, the other big story over the weekend, which we wish we didn't have to report, the dad of a slain police officer in Newark, New Jersey, is outraged, as most of America, to find out that the killer, the alleged killer of his 26-year-old son, will not be tried as an adult. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=101.44000000000001s)]
*  He says it's a pain that's indescribable. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  You have no words for this pain. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  What's your reaction to the 14-year-old? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  I guess it's New Jersey law. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=129.6s)]
*  They will not be tried for the murder in which he perpetrated. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=131.72s)]
*  Yeah, if you're under the age of 15, you know, you're tried as a juvenile, your records are sealed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=135.84s)]
*  There's no jury. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=142.4s)]
*  It's a judge's decision. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=143.64s)]
*  And the sentence is much lighter. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=145.72s)]
*  You know, you don't magically change when the day you turn 15 years old. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=147.68s)]
*  In a great many states, they have a better rule, a better law, that it's up to the judge. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=154.0s)]
*  It's up to the judge to decide. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=159.56s)]
*  You know, if you're acting like an adult, acquiring a gun, using a gun to ambush, to assassinate a law enforcement official, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=161.08s)]
*  you ought to be treated like an adult. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=171.08s)]
*  And in New Jersey, that would be 30 years to life behind bars. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=173.8s)]
*  But here as a juvenile, he's treated dramatically differently. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, it says he can get up to 20 years as a juvenile. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  That's nonsense. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=185.36s)]
*  In a practical matter, it's a whole lot less. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=186.92s)]
*  And I've covered too many cases. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  Juveniles who get out after being convicted of murder and who then go on a murder spree killing others. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=192.32s)]
*  It's wrong. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=200.68s)]
*  And these states need to adjust their laws. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=201.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=205.32s)]
*  It's just highlighted now because of the tragedy over the weekend that no one saw coming. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=205.84s)]
*  Greg Jarrett, thanks so much. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAULxInEmg&t=209.92s)]
