# Attorney reveals the ‘next step’ if Daniel Penny is found guilty
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY)
*  Tomorrow morning, closing arguments will begin in Daniel Penny's manslaughter trial here in New York City. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=0.0s)]
*  The Marine Veterans family telling the New York Post, quote, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=6.0s)]
*  We've seen Danny be strong throughout all of this. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=9.0s)]
*  When this initially happened, there was a lot of attention and it's really scary and uncertain. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=13.0s)]
*  It makes you want to recede and hide, but his strength has encouraged us. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=18.0s)]
*  New York-based trial attorney Rebecca Rose Woodland joins us now. Good morning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=23.0s)]
*  Good morning. Thank you for joining us. So we were speaking just a few minutes ago. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=27.0s)]
*  Closing arguments start tomorrow. My perception of this case was, I don't know how they could convict him, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=30.0s)]
*  but going back and reading this morning, it looks like a lot of the witnesses kind of brought in things that helped him [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=36.0s)]
*  and brought in things that hurt him. I think the main contingency being did he keep the choke hold too long. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=41.0s)]
*  But we were talking about the actual cause of death. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=46.0s)]
*  Explain to me what you see there and how that might be a part of the defense's closing argument. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=49.0s)]
*  I think this is going to be such a big part. I'm happy you brought it up because what I think is going to happen [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=53.0s)]
*  is we're going to see the prosecution paint this case as if this man, Daniel Penny, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=59.0s)]
*  held the victim down for too long, too hard, knew what he was doing. He was reckless. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=65.0s)]
*  The defense is going to show you in this case that he restrained the victim [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=73.0s)]
*  because the victim was under the influence of synthetic marijuana and many other drugs, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=80.0s)]
*  had other issues, including psychosis, held him. He was alive when the police arrived. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=86.0s)]
*  He attempted to just restrain him. That is it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=93.0s)]
*  We are not looking at a situation where there was intent and he is not charged with intent to kill, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=98.0s)]
*  but even reckless behavior. We're not seeing that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=103.0s)]
*  I think that's what the defense will really, really try to tell the jury tomorrow in a clear way. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=107.0s)]
*  This man wasn't reckless. He was just trying to help other subway pass. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=113.0s)]
*  In the witnesses for the trial, they did have the chief medical examiner's office, Cynthia Harris, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=117.0s)]
*  Dr. Cynthia Harris say that it was ruled a homicide with the cause of death being compression of neck. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=123.0s)]
*  But then you have this forensic pathologist who came out and said that these substances were found [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=129.0s)]
*  and that could have caused the death. So now moving forward, the jury is going to have to figure this out. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=134.0s)]
*  There's also the Marine that said, hey, this is how we learn it, but he held it too long. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=139.0s)]
*  What happens if he is found guilty? What's the next step after that? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=144.0s)]
*  Well, the next step after if he's found guilty, which I really hope that a jury can see through this [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=147.0s)]
*  and see this as a politically motivated case. But if he is found guilty, then there'll be the sentencing phase. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=152.0s)]
*  Like we've seen in other cases, we'll take some time. They'll return back to the courtroom. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=159.0s)]
*  And, you know, he's facing many years in jail. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=164.0s)]
*  Fifteen years. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=167.0s)]
*  Right. But the judge can't has leeway because this is a state case, leeway in the sentencing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=168.0s)]
*  And then we'll see appeals. I mean, immediately the defense will appeal this verdict if it is a guilty verdict. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=174.0s)]
*  It's sad that Jordan nearly had to die, but it's even more sad that they would prosecute or persecute a Marine veteran who tried to help people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=180.0s)]
*  Right. There was no intention to kill him, nor do I believe he was reckless. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=188.0s)]
*  Listen, thank you for joining us. Thanks for bringing your expertise and we'll see what happens tomorrow. All right. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qSXgXMQmY&t=191.0s)]
