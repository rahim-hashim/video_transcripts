# FEMA official told relief workers in Florida to avoid homes with Trump signs, report says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ)
*  Another issue that highlighted the incompetency of Joe Biden was hurricane relief and FEMA's reaction, right? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=5.2s)]
*  And Joe Biden was in charge, but Kamala Harris was running, and there was really, there was an avoidance of wanting to talk about how significant the impact is on so many communities based on two hurricanes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=5.7s)]
*  Now, according to the Daily Wire, this is a staggering story. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=17.3s)]
*  FEMA officials, so you know, which should be helping everybody, directed hurricane relief workers in Florida to avoid certain homes that had Trump signs in their lawn. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=21.7s)]
*  Okay, here's the report according to the Daily Wire. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=32.2s)]
*  A FEMA supervisor told workers in a message to avoid homes advertising Trump as they canvassed Lake Placid, Florida to identify residents who could qualify for federal aid. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=35.2s)]
*  Internal messages viewed by the Daily Wire reveal the supervisor, Marnie Washington, relayed this message both verbally and in group chat used by the relief team. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=46.2s)]
*  Multiple government employees told the Daily Wire. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=56.2s)]
*  So now hurricane relief also politicized. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=60.2s)]
*  Yeah, no question. And by the way, there was already outrage that so many FEMA funds had been rated to give to illegal immigrants. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=64.2s)]
*  And so obviously people are saying we got it. We got to take the politics out of something as essential as emergency relief. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=71.2s)]
*  I mean, this is insane. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=78.2s)]
*  And by the way, the FEMA spokesperson has a statement. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=80.2s)]
*  FEMA helps all survivors, regardless of their political preference or affiliation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=83.2s)]
*  And we are deeply disturbed by this employees actions while we believe this is an isolated incident. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=88.2s)]
*  We've taken measures to remove the employee from their role and are investigating the matter to prevent this from happening ever again. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=92.2s)]
*  The employee who issued this guidance had no authority and was given no direction from anyone to tell teams to avoid these homes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=97.2s)]
*  And we are reaching out to the people who may not who may not who have not been reached as a result of this incident. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=104.2s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm surprised that I think you see lots of agencies getting politicized. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=111.2s)]
*  This is one you really wouldn't expect. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=117.2s)]
*  Well, it's not just to me. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=119.2s)]
*  It's my focus is less on FEMA and more. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=121.2s)]
*  I would imagine this is the case in every government agency. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=123.2s)]
*  And what it does is show the depth of the cancer inside of our government and that you have to root out politicization at the highest levels, for example, the DOJ. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=126.2s)]
*  But you have to also understand there's a bureaucracy under every one of these state departments where you have, you know, foot soldiers who behave in the same manner as Merrick Garland. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=136.2s)]
*  And in order to really reform the bureaucracy, I actually think you are going to need like Elon Musk walking through the lobbies of Washington, D.C. with a sink in his hands. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=148.2s)]
*  He's going to have to sit there with the Department of Government Efficiency and cut it down to the size you could drown it in a bathtub. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=157.2s)]
*  Otherwise, this is where we are now. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=162.2s)]
*  That's the challenge. That to me is one of the most interesting things about how this will play out. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=165.2s)]
*  So Elon Musk fired 90 percent of Twitter, turned it into X because he had to change the culture. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=168.2s)]
*  It doesn't work that way with government. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=172.2s)]
*  You just wish it could. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=174.2s)]
*  I remember you can't you can't you can't know you can you can't you just have to do it on a certain process and you got to be dedicated to doing it and demonstrating how to do it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=175.2s)]
*  Well, the first thing you have to do is take out the unionization of federal employees so that they're fireball. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=184.2s)]
*  And I also heard that and by the way, that is a massive task. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=189.2s)]
*  We did that at the VA when I was just the VA and they refused to use it inside the VA. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=192.2s)]
*  So the government bureaucracy then fights back and says, OK, we have this tool, but we're not going to use it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=198.2s)]
*  And they certainly don't. I mean, it's the fight worth having. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=202.2s)]
*  That is the fight. It is the most important fight in the others. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=205.2s)]
*  I would be equally pessimistic just because based upon our history and the size of this thing, I think the only thing gives me some inspiration. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=207.2s)]
*  Well, there's two things. One, the involvement of Elon Musk. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=213.2s)]
*  I think that is incredibly big. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=216.2s)]
*  And the second is to see some model of it in Argentina with Javier Malik. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=218.2s)]
*  I mean, he has actually cut down government when it's hard to find an example on the world stage. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=221.2s)]
*  There is actually one in Argentina. Yeah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=226.2s)]
*  And they have seen, by the way, a decrease in their inflation rates, like at this astounding rate just since he took office. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=228.2s)]
*  So these things can be turned around. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=234.2s)]
*  The other thing that Donald Trump said just this week, I believe, he said, we're going to move some of these agencies to other states. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=236.2s)]
*  That's a really amazing way to make sure that it's not just these really liberal, DC, suburb kind of people that are, you know, populating the bureaucracy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=242.2s)]
*  Get it out, decentralize, make sure that these agencies are representative of the people. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=253.2s)]
*  And I think that would help to get them politicized. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=258.2s)]
*  It's an amazing idea. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=261.2s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEomACutKQ&t=262.2s)]
