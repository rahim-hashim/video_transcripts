# 'THIS IS SO STUPID': Democrat under fire for Musk, Melania rant
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y)
*  So if you're hearing me while we're not attacking the things that are really threatening America, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=0.0s)]
*  like China's invasion of Iran, excuse me, of Taiwan, and then what were happening now [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  with the phase two, other Russia, Ukraine, ceasefire talks, which are on the way, it's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=9.16s)]
*  going to be all about this politicization. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  But Democrats are looking to get their footing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=16.36s)]
*  They're looking to get something. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=18.36s)]
*  So the signal gave them one thing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=19.44s)]
*  The other thing they have is Jasmine Crockett embarrassing herself, and Maxine Waters continuing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=20.72s)]
*  to bring her level of rhetoric to new heights. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=25.44s)]
*  Now she's targeting the First Lady. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=28.34s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=30.74s)]
*  We don't care how much money you have, Elon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=31.74s)]
*  We don't give a damn about Doja. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=35.94s)]
*  We are going to defend the Constitution because we believe in democracy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=43.42s)]
*  So many people have sacrificed and fought and died for democracy. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  And Trump comes along with his ignorant a** and he don't even know the Constitution. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=57.58s)]
*  If he wants to start looking so closely to find those who were born here and their parents [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=63.7s)]
*  were undocumented, maybe he ought to first look at Melania. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=70.7s)]
*  Yeah, because Melania is out here doing the crimes in this country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is so stupid. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=79.5s)]
*  You got an American president who was elected on this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=81.02s)]
*  We got 80% of the country that agrees with him on this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=83.9s)]
*  Even people in her party say, get these criminals out of the country. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=86.66000000000001s)]
*  The raping people, right? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=89.86s)]
*  The murdering people in the country, right? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=91.82000000000001s)]
*  Or they're taking over resources in this country right now? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=93.94000000000001s)]
*  And there was a mandated election. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  Even months, two months after the election, the number one issue that he continues to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=99.06s)]
*  hit in the 80% is immigration. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=103.66000000000001s)]
*  And the Democratic Party seems to don't get that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=107.86000000000001s)]
*  They're making this an anti-immigrant thing instead of an illegal immigration thing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=110.06s)]
*  Well, and she was referring to the fact that on his first day, Donald Trump signed that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  executive order banning birthright citizenship. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  So that's what she, the way she did it through the back door, like I'm going to, okay, I'm [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=122.42s)]
*  going to hit him, but first I'm going to hit his wife. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=127.34s)]
*  Yeah, birthright citizenship, I think this is a worthy debate. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=129.62s)]
*  So getting rid of Melania, I don't think there's anybody in support of that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=133.02s)]
*  But if you have an 88-year-old woman from Los Angeles, a city that is failing in real [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=137.06s)]
*  time as your spokesperson, I'm pretty sure you can't be happy today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=143.18s)]
*  I can't imagine this paints a picture any other than Democrats in disarray. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=147.86s)]
*  As you look at now, AOC pulling top of her party, although still only 10%. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=155.26000000000002s)]
*  I don't know what this says about their future in a moment where moderate Democrats are saying, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=161.98000000000002s)]
*  we don't know who we are and we don't know where this party's going. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=166.66s)]
*  What's wrong with making government more efficient? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=169.7s)]
*  You happy the way you're trying? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=171.5s)]
*  You lie because they're all getting paid off. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=172.5s)]
*  All these Democrat organizations, you got Stacey Abrams who ran for office twice. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=174.22s)]
*  But don't worry about it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  We're going to cut her a check on her way out of the administration. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=182.66s)]
*  It has been a cash cow. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=185.8s)]
*  The reason why they're so upset, these are all their donors. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  These are their people that have supported them for years by cutting the waste and fraud [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=191.66s)]
*  and abuse, is cutting their bottom line. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=196.5s)]
*  That's why they're so passionate about all this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=199.46s)]
*  There's been no protests from these people when American citizens get killed by illegals. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=202.02s)]
*  You don't see them protesting in the middle street, but you attack their money, oh they [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=207.02s)]
*  get real mad. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=210.86s)]
*  Well, and we're probably going to see a lot of that today at the Doge hearing regarding [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=211.86s)]
*  NPR and PBS. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=216.7s)]
*  It's like we can't live without it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=217.7s)]
*  You'll see highlights here on Fox. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=220.18s)]
*  You'll see highlights here on Fox. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGHtn1HSR0Y&t=226.5s)]
