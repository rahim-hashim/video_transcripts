# 'Did NOT go over well': KJP blocks Kirby from briefing on cease-fire
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo)
*  The soap opera power going behind the scenes KJP and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=0.0s)]
*  Admiral Kirby seemed to be sparring. She has a huge problem with him. Obviously, she's very insecure and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=4.24s)]
*  Anytime the war happened Ukraine got invaded you see things go crazy in the Middle East [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=9.8s)]
*  You need somebody with international experience and that's why he looked as an asset [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=14.72s)]
*  But evidently he couldn't call on his own reporters [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=19.12s)]
*  She would always be there to introduce him and then yesterday when this happens Kirby's there in person and she's not [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  But according to Jackie Heinrich [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=28.880000000000003s)]
*  KJP's decision to block Kirby from the briefing made reporters wait for a virtual background call to get news about the ceasefire [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=30.92s)]
*  It did not go over well among the staff who described it as ending on a note of ego [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=37.0s)]
*  The administration source told Fox [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=42.8s)]
*  It's one thing to block Kirby from going to the briefing room [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  But it's another not to even do the homework to be able to answer the question [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=47.88s)]
*  On the most pressing pressing issue news that had in months Kirby had the answers [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=51.92s)]
*  But she had to be there even though she says and knows nothing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=56.48s)]
*  Well, she didn't know Matt Miller what what State Department guy even when I disagree with Kirby you can't deny [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  He's an effective communicator. He has the goods on what's happening knows what's going on [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=65.47999999999999s)]
*  This has been reported on throughout the administration that many people thought that he should have got the job [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=70.44s)]
*  He was more competent for the job, but they gave it to her and you see that as you say rightly Brian the insecurity there [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=75.96s)]
*  Okay, so she's going out not knowing see my problem is not her message is it is as if he doesn't get briefed [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=83.92s)]
*  She doesn't do the reading Jen Psaki did the reading when she talked [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=90.36s)]
*  I almost thought she was setting policy right and it was almost like reversal like Joe Biden listen to Jen Psaki [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=93.84s)]
*  That's where you're heading or that's what you should be saying with with KJP. It's it's not a matter of preferences [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=99.0s)]
*  I have to follow you but you got to help with the story. You got to move a story forward [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  I think the answers are in the big book of answers, but she just simply doesn't [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=108.4s)]
*  The president United States was in as Peter was talking about he did a farewell speech [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=113.88s)]
*  Usually it's one of those things where oh look at all the stuff. We got accomplished all the money you're you're living a better life [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Good luck with the next guy essentially [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  But one thing that really caught everybody's eyes was for you know for decades [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=128.36s)]
*  The Democrats could count on certain constituencies and over the last [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=133.88s)]
*  I don't know two three election cycles. They've been able to count on Silicon Valley to help them out [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=138.36s)]
*  well now as you know as we've detailed Elon Musk is [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  unofficial part of Donald Trump's cabinet Mark Zuckerberg Tim Apple as he was referred to it's gonna be at the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=148.44000000000003s)]
*  inauguration along with Sam Albin [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=156.28000000000003s)]
*  Silicon Valley is lining up now behind or at least cozy enough to Donald Trump and that is driving Joe Biden who used to count [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  Crazy he referred to them not by name. He referred to them as the tech [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=166.0s)]
*  Industrial complex from the resolute desk last night watch [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=171.16s)]

*  Spoke of the dangers of the military industrial complex. He warned us then about and I quote the potential [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  for the disastrous rise of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=186.56s)]
*  Misplaced power I'm equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech industrial complex [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  It could pose real dangers for our country as well [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  Americans are being buried [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=200.56s)]
*  Under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=202.56s)]
*  Social media is giving up on fact-checking [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=206.08s)]
*  The truth is smothered by lies [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=209.52s)]
*  told for power and for profit [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=212.44s)]

*  Big-tech who has been in the pockets of the Democratic Party for years [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=230.16s)]
*  They set out one election cycle because things are going so bad with the country and now you want to make them an enemy [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=234.28s)]
*  They helped you out the last time. Yeah, what about apologizing to the American people when you said that the laptop was disinformation [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=241.98000000000002s)]
*  You knew your son was an addict. You knew he was posting things [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=248.88s)]

*  I feel like there's so much bitterness [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=261.92s)]
*  You I agree with you Steve that when you go usually a president would talk about his accomplishments [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=264.56s)]

*  When Mark Zuckerberg spoke to Congress and said he was telling us to do this so we're following along [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=291.88s)]
*  Yeah, George Soros putting DA's in to allow him to run rampant in the streets as opposed to these tech executives working for nothing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSQnYaJoxPo&t=297.4s)]
