# Pastor torches Kamala Harris: 'Never been so offended in my life'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8)
*  So with three weeks to the election, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=0.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris is trying to shore up support among black male voters [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=2.0s)]
*  with new initiatives, including loans for black entrepreneurs [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=5.8s)]
*  and new regulations for cryptocurrency [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=8.8s)]
*  and legalizing marijuana nationally. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Your underlying premise is not an assumption [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=14.64s)]
*  that I'm supposed to have black men in my back pocket [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=18.04s)]
*  in terms of their vote, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=22.28s)]
*  and that I should be taking that for granted, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=24.92s)]
*  because I don't. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=29.02s)]
*  Black men are no different from anybody else. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=31.18s)]
*  They expect that you have to earn their vote. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=33.82s)]
*  So why is she just doing it now? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=37.379999999999995s)]
*  And today she'll be sitting down with Charlemagne, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=38.72s)]
*  the god in Detroit, a move our next guest says [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=40.42s)]
*  will not hit the mark with black voters in their city. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=43.32s)]
*  Lorenzo Sewell is a senior pastor at 180 Church in Detroit. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=46.3s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=49.94s)]
*  He had the former president there as well, Donald Trump. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=51.4s)]
*  Sir, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=54.980000000000004s)]
*  Lorenzo, I'm so holy ghost happy [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=57.72s)]
*  to be here with you this morning. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=59.24s)]
*  All right, pastor, so tell me this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=61.14s)]
*  Is this gonna work with black voters? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=62.5s)]
*  I know that when it comes to black males, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=64.06s)]
*  entrepreneurship is big for us. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=66.88s)]
*  How is she gonna overtax us, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=69.2s)]
*  but then give us loans as well? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=71.72s)]
*  I have never been so offended in my life. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=74.94s)]
*  She's bringing a man here who is Charlemagne, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=77.08s)]
*  a false god, to a community that has 4,500 churches, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=80.58s)]
*  all people of faith. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=86.34s)]
*  We are extremely offended that she's bringing a podcaster [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=88.0s)]
*  here to talk to black men about politics. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=91.78s)]
*  She brought a retired athlete to Flint, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=95.38s)]
*  who is failing Magic Johnson. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=98.53999999999999s)]
*  And she brought Oprah to Oakland County [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=100.78s)]
*  as if she understands the plight and the plane [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=103.86s)]
*  of people that look like me. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=107.28s)]
*  We will not allow virtue signaling, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=108.98s)]
*  or we will not allow identity politics. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=111.46s)]
*  Black men are not political infants. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=114.3s)]
*  We know exactly what's happening with the Democratic Party. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=117.53999999999999s)]
*  We know that they've exploited us for over six decades, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=120.82s)]
*  and we are saying, just like Moses said to Pharaoh, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=124.5s)]
*  let my people go. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=128.9s)]
*  So pastor, tell me, what are you hearing [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=132.3s)]
*  from the folks that you're speaking to? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=134.3s)]
*  I was in Detroit last week. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=136.34s)]
*  I heard multiple, I had multiple conversations [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=137.68s)]
*  with voters, black males in the barbershop, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=141.01999999999998s)]
*  and opinions from all over the political spectrum. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=144.98s)]
*  But what are they telling you they want [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=147.22s)]
*  from a political candidate, a president? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=149.33999999999997s)]
*  They're saying they want a president [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=152.38s)]
*  that number one, can help us with election integrity. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=154.38s)]
*  We understand that in the city of Detroit, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  election integrity is an issue. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  The second thing, we want a president [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=163.01999999999998s)]
*  that can hold accountable our local and our state government [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=165.64s)]
*  from the resources that are already here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=169.5s)]
*  We already have federal funding through agencies like SVA, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=172.02s)]
*  which President Donald Trump opened up that portal [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=176.10000000000002s)]
*  in a way that it has never been opened up [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=179.38000000000002s)]
*  in the history of the SVA, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=181.86s)]
*  which by the way, was started by Republicans. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=183.82000000000002s)]
*  And we want a politician that's real, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=186.34s)]
*  that wants to come here and listen to us. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=189.14000000000001s)]
*  Vice President Harris, she's not spoken to any pastors. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=191.58s)]
*  Vice President Harris, she continues to think [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=194.9s)]
*  that she can entertain her way to the black vote. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=197.56s)]
*  We are offended and we want her to be willing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=201.06s)]
*  to actually bring real solutions to the complex problems [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=204.5s)]
*  that we're facing in urban America. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=208.66s)]
*  Yeah, black folks continue to say [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=210.74s)]
*  that we want to provide for our families, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=212.62s)]
*  take care of our families. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=214.0s)]
*  Whatever candidate that offers the best agenda for that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=214.94s)]
*  is gonna get the sheer of the vote. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=218.34s)]
*  Pastors, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=219.96s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxM0Q_-oh-8&t=231.06s)]
