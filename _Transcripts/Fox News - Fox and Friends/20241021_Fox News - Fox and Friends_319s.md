# JD Vance tears into Kamala Harris over 'bizarre' response to protesters
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU)
*  All right, let's talk about something else [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=0.0s)]
*  happened over the weekend. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=1.44s)]
*  When you go to a big crowd, you can't make, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  usually they're supporters, sometimes they're not. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=4.2s)]
*  Sometimes they're hecklers. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=6.4s)]
*  So, Kamala Harris prides herself on, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=7.76s)]
*  I'm talking now, this is my microphone. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=11.28s)]
*  She loves doing that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=13.56s)]
*  I'm speaking. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=14.4s)]
*  Well, evidently, the chant that was interrupting her [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=15.24s)]
*  was pro Jesus. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  By the way, Jesus is trending on X right now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=20.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=22.6s)]
*  That caught my attention. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=23.44s)]
*  It's a great day for Christians. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=24.26s)]
*  But, they yelled out. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=25.64s)]
*  They yelled out, Jesus is Lord. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=27.78s)]
*  Jesus is Lord. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=29.24s)]
*  And then she says, you're at the wrong rally. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  Which is a weird response, knowing that that was your heckle [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=33.6s)]
*  if it was a heckle. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=37.64s)]
*  And then it happened to JD Vance. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=38.64s)]
*  Some students or people in the audience yelled, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=41.48s)]
*  Jesus is King. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=44.28s)]
*  Did you tape both of those? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=45.12s)]
*  I have them both, and I put them together [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  with my edit machine in my office. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=49.08s)]
*  You're good. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=50.84s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=51.68s)]
*  We remember, Donald Trump hand selected [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=54.36s)]
*  the three members of the United States Supreme Court. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=58.0s)]
*  With the intention that they would undo the protections [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=60.6s)]
*  of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=65.92s)]
*  Oh, you guys are at the wrong rally. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=73.82s)]
*  No, I think you've met to go to the smaller one [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=75.92s)]
*  down the street. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  There is something really bizarre [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  with Kamala Harris's anti-Christian rhetoric [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=81.72s)]
*  and anti-Christian approach to public policy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=84.88s)]
*  I don't think we've, I don't think that we've, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=87.0s)]
*  that's right, Jesus is King. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=89.24s)]
*  And I don't think that we've seen. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=90.88s)]
*  Here's the problem with this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=92.48s)]
*  I think the day before you had the pro-Palestinian people [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=98.2s)]
*  that the pro-Hamas folks that were in her rally. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  And she kicked them out, true. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=105.28s)]
*  But then she said after, well, let's be clear. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=107.44s)]
*  These kids have a point here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=110.44s)]
*  I stand with the people in Gaza. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=112.16s)]
*  Compare that and contrast that to what she did there [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=114.5s)]
*  when those young people were saying Jesus is King. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=117.9s)]
*  She didn't kick them out and say, well, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=120.06s)]
*  they have a point, Jesus is King. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=121.58s)]
*  I mean, she professes to be a woman of faith [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=123.26s)]
*  and everything, seems like a layup. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=126.1s)]
*  You can kick them out and still say I stand with. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=127.74s)]
*  But to then say you're at the wrong rally, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=129.66s)]
*  I think Jesus should be welcome [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=132.44s)]
*  at Democrats rallies as well. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=133.7s)]
*  If she heard what they were saying, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=135.58s)]
*  and if they were screaming that out, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=137.58s)]
*  and it was crystal clear, and she still said that, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=138.84s)]
*  I was shocked that any politician would put down [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=142.3s)]
*  the number one religion in our country [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=146.02s)]
*  and someone yelling out something that's true [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=147.78s)]
*  and so personal to many of us. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=150.22s)]
*  Also, JD Vance was bartending over the weekend too. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=151.94s)]
*  Yeah, he was. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=154.78s)]
*  So I like the dude, they're blue-collaring it, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=155.62s)]
*  Trump and JD Vance over the weekend. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=158.62s)]
*  But that just shows you the difference, right, Brian? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=159.98000000000002s)]
*  I mean, for many of us- [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, sir, he's at a Packers game. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=162.54000000000002s)]
*  No, but for many of us, our faith is so important. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=163.94s)]
*  And when you yell out Jesus is Lord, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  and she says you're at the wrong rally, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  and then the other candidate is saying, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=170.94s)]
*  you're right, Jesus is king. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=174.3s)]
*  I just think what the Trump campaign is doing [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=175.78s)]
*  when it comes to Donald Trump going to the barbershops, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=179.66s)]
*  visiting the local, you got JD Vance [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  as Brian noted is bartending. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=183.62s)]
*  That was supposed to be Harrison Wallace. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=186.16s)]
*  They were supposed to be the everyday people, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=187.94s)]
*  the gun person- Coach Wallace. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=190.32s)]
*  Coach Wallace, relatable. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=192.02s)]
*  And you don't see any of that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=193.78s)]
*  And when they do try to attempt it, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=195.3s)]
*  they don't seem natural at all. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=197.44s)]
*  They don't seem relatable. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=199.45999999999998s)]
*  Well, we'll see if it is a short run [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=201.26s)]
*  for Jim Gaffigan as Tim Walsh, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=203.5s)]
*  because he does a brilliant Tim Walsh. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=206.54s)]
*  Well, there were two of these two- [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=207.98s)]
*  We'll find out. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=209.14s)]
*  We got them before more of these two. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=209.98s)]
*  They did do a great job. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=210.82s)]
*  The actors that they have playing [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=212.17999999999998s)]
*  all the candidates right now are really good, yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=214.5s)]
*  But those two students that were in the audience [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=217.38s)]
*  at the Kamala Harris event, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=220.22s)]
*  and I think they did get kicked out. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  They were on with Fox and Friends yesterday, watch this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=224.22s)]
*  I'm sure she talked about overturning Roe v. Wade [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=227.9s)]
*  and Donald Trump. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=230.62s)]
*  I yelled out to the crowd [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=231.94000000000003s)]
*  that abortion is the sacrament of Satan. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=233.58s)]
*  And when I said that, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=235.98000000000002s)]
*  I deeply do believe that as a Christian. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=237.46s)]
*  And about 10 seconds go by, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=239.84s)]
*  and that's when the video of my friend Grant and I, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=241.82000000000002s)]
*  proclaiming that Christ is Lord and Jesus is King, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=246.58s)]
*  see on the video, she waves. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=249.3s)]
*  She waves. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=250.78000000000003s)]
*  She was actually waving to me. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=251.98000000000002s)]
*  This is what you are gonna get [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=253.26000000000002s)]
*  with a Kamala Harris presidency. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=254.66000000000003s)]
*  You are going to get the Kamala Harris [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=256.98s)]
*  that alienates over 50% of the US population [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=259.38s)]
*  that is Christian. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=263.26s)]
*  Yeah, all she had to do is say amen. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=265.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Amen. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=268.98s)]
*  But this is, please leave the room. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=270.44s)]
*  I'm still doing my speech. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=272.86s)]
*  But she just gave another moment [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=274.70000000000005s)]
*  to average day people that are saying, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  like, why would she say that? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=280.06s)]
*  Why would she say that? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=281.54s)]
*  Any other politician would have did, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=282.38s)]
*  the political career would be over. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=283.74s)]
*  Either she heard it and she wanted to kick them out [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=285.34s)]
*  and truly believes they're at the wrong rally, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=288.61999999999995s)]
*  or she was prepared for hecklers [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=291.38s)]
*  and she talked to her staff and she said, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=294.41999999999996s)]
*  what do I do if I'm ever heckled? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=295.9s)]
*  And they probably said, just make it funny [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=297.46s)]

*  and she yelled that out [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=303.94s)]
*  because that was something she had prepared for. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=305.73999999999995s)]
*  And most compelling analysis. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw1z5UuiTIU&t=315.34s)]
