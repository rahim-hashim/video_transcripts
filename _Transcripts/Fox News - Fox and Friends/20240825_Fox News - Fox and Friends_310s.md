# Hundreds of kids left without bus service as blue state funds buses for migrants
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY)
*  Over 100 students in a district outside of Boston will have to find a new way to get to school in September. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=0.0s)]
*  They won't have bus service due to a shortage, as comes as the state started paying for buses for migrant students [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=6.0s)]
*  whose families recently moved into their community. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=14.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Ashley Francois, a mom of three from that school district. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=17.0s)]
*  Ashley, this is quite the story, and it's one that impacts you personally, I understand. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=22.0s)]
*  You have, is it three children, and all of whom now have forgotten a way to get to school? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=26.0s)]
*  One out of my three children have a bus for the school year because she's in elementary. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=33.0s)]
*  The other two are middle school and high school, and that's where it stopped buses for these kids. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=38.0s)]
*  I see one of them right there. I see one of the kids right there. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=43.0s)]
*  Make your way in, it's fine. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=47.0s)]
*  It's fine. And I understand, not only do you have to figure this out for two kids, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=52.0s)]
*  let's just talk about your personal situation a little bit. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=56.0s)]
*  I know that all of your kids are on IEPs, you live three miles from the school, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=59.0s)]
*  and you yourself don't have the capability of driving them to school. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=63.0s)]
*  I had quite a fun experience here in Stoughton. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=68.0s)]
*  Three years ago, the Stoughton police suspended my license indefinitely for medical fraud, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=72.0s)]
*  and upon that, I had had many issues getting my kids to school. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=77.0s)]
*  So as of February of 23, the school system actually filed education neglect on me. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=82.0s)]
*  One of my children on the IEP has school refusal, and that's one of the kids not allowed on the bus or taken off the bus. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=87.0s)]
*  So they just basically fed right into exactly what this child wanted, and that's not to be at school. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=93.0s)]
*  So now you've made it absolutely impossible for me to get him there to access the curriculum, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=99.0s)]
*  access the services that you are specializing for him. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=105.0s)]
*  So if he's not getting to school to get these services, then your kids aren't going to be able to access any type of curriculum from the Stoughton public schools if there's no way to get them there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=108.0s)]
*  And I think you may have said this, but you have some medical issues that's kept you from maintaining a license. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=118.0s)]
*  So you're really in a situation here. You need the buses. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=122.0s)]
*  And this is coming as this is happening at the same time in Massachusetts. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=125.0s)]
*  Your migrant population the last four years has grown exponentially since 2021. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=129.0s)]
*  Three hundred and fifty five thousand living in Massachusetts. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=134.0s)]
*  Fifty thousand new arrivals, ten thousand children. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=137.0s)]
*  Again, these are all migrant children. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=140.0s)]
*  And from what I understand as well, that actually there's bus service set up for these illegal immigrants. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=143.0s)]
*  So you're losing bus service. They're gaining bus service. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=150.0s)]
*  Yep. And Stoughton says that it's government agencies paying for these extra buses for the outside families. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=155.0s)]
*  How does that make you feel? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=162.0s)]
*  I kind of feel torn at this because one, and I'm going based on my knowledge off of the IP services, children on IP is receiving state and federal funding to receive these services outside of already a budget given to the students in the school. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=166.0s)]
*  Along with that, Stoughton Public Schools has made it a priority to have parents sign health insurance waivers for them now to go and get funding from their health insurance. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=183.0s)]
*  They're getting three different funding for children specialized on IPs. Why can't they get a bus? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=191.0s)]
*  And on top of that, children on IPs, if a child already regular student, no IP, get the bus slot, a child with an IP, if they do not qualify for specialized transportation automatically get a bus on that side on that bus as well. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=196.0s)]
*  So I, I've where I was that parent that would be going into schools advocating for parents to get the children's services. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=209.0s)]
*  I was here and so in doing that for my three kids. And I just don't understand. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=217.0s)]
*  Last question. What are you going to do? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=222.0s)]
*  I'm probably going to keep them home. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=227.0s)]
*  Because it narrows it down to the fact that if one, I can't work, I can't drive. So that means my income is extremely budgeted income. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=229.0s)]
*  And there's four of us. So am I supposed to pay between four to six Ubers a day for the entirety of the school year to get my children to school and then question how I'm going to pay for my home, the electricity, the food they need to eat, the clothes, school supplies, because we get probably two pages of list of school supplies for each grade. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=239.0s)]
*  It's not just a stolen public school standardized list. Students need this. Each grade has specific things they need. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=258.0s)]
*  And this while resources are going to, you know, a finite number of resources that can only go so many places and resources going to illegal immigrants that could be going to people in need like yourself. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=265.0s)]
*  By the way, the Stoughton superintendent did give us this statement. He said when we complete the process for no fee busing, we received 162 more requests this year. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=275.0s)]
*  We could not have anticipated such an increase to that end. We provide busing as of Friday for all K through six students within our policy that addresses your elementary school student. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=283.0s)]
*  Ashley, we are addressing this issue this coming week should be close to getting 100% getting transportation. We'll know more after Tuesday. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=292.0s)]
*  So we wish you the best of luck on Tuesday. What comes after? Hopefully it isn't that you have to keep them home and you get them to school. Thank you, Ashley. Thank you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_PLLDcYWwY&t=300.0s)]
