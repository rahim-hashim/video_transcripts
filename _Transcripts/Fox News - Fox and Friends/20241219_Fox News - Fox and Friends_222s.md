# Sen. Kennedy: Trump is the one that can get this done right now
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218)
*  Let's bring in Senator John Kennedy from the great state of Louisiana. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=0.0s)]
*  Now Senator, the President has made it very clear he's against the CR Vice President. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=4.68s)]
*  Elect is against it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  It looks like half of the members in the conservative wing as well as the moderate wing are against [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=12.52s)]
*  it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  What's going on down there? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=19.68s)]
*  Well Lawrence, I saw what you saw. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=21.16s)]
*  I mean it's a multiple vehicle pile up. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=24.92s)]
*  I knew as soon as I saw the bill it was going to be trouble. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=29.96s)]
*  The thing was as big as a Costco and Speaker Johnson had to add a lot of spending porn [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=34.52s)]
*  to get the Democrats on board. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=42.64s)]
*  This can be fixed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=45.52s)]
*  If I were king for a day, I'm not and I don't aspire to be. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=48.32000000000001s)]
*  Here's what I'd do. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  First I would tell everybody to take their meds. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=53.6s)]
*  Number two, I think President Trump is going to have to consider coming to Washington. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean let's face it, he's the President now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=62.0s)]
*  It's not President Biden. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  President Trump needs to sit down with Mike Johnson and John Thune and come up with a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=67.76s)]
*  new skinny CR. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=71.72s)]
*  If the President wants to do something on the debt limit, we need to find out what it [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=73.92s)]
*  is and put it in the bill. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  And then the President's going to have to help Mike sell it in the House. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=80.32s)]
*  Democrats in the House are not going to go along with it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=85.16s)]
*  Mike's problem, Speaker Johnson's problem is that on the Republican side he's got a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=87.72s)]
*  bunch of free-range chickens. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  I'm not criticizing them but they wander off and Mike can't catch all of them by himself. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=94.52s)]
*  So can he be Speaker then? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  He's going to need, if I can just finish my thought, he's going to need the President's [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  help. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=106.0s)]
*  Now after it passes the House, it's going to come to the Senate. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=107.16s)]
*  The President's going to have to sit down with John Thune and Chuck Schumer and Chuck [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=111.48s)]
*  is going to come with a laundry list of spending porn and President Trump's going to have to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=117.28s)]
*  say no and Schumer's going to say I'm going to blame it on you and President Trump is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=122.16s)]
*  going to say I'm going to fight. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=127.36s)]
*  That's why we'll get it done. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=130.12s)]
*  I got you on the process point and I think it's well taken. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=132.32s)]
*  And I talked to the President yesterday and he made it very clear that he likes Mike Johnson [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=137.4s)]
*  and he's in a difficult position but this is not the right way. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=140.96s)]
*  I guess the big question is, and you put it out there, that he cannot control the House [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=144.2s)]
*  right now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=150.28s)]
*  So can Mike Johnson remain Speaker then? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=151.28s)]
*  There's one person that can control the Republican caucus in the United States House of Representatives [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=155.56s)]
*  right now and that's Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=164.4s)]
*  That's my best assessment at this point. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=167.72s)]
*  Could that change? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=171.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=172.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=173.0s)]
*  But Speaker Johnson cannot, it's clear he hasn't been able to do it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=174.0s)]
*  It's not his fault. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=178.36s)]
*  I mean I'm not sure anybody could but he can't get all the Republicans together in the House [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=179.56s)]
*  and in order to pass the CR he's got to do that without Democratic support but I think [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  President Trump could and I hope he'll consider coming to Washington. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=190.96s)]
*  Like I say, he's the President, it's not Joe Biden. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=194.72000000000003s)]
*  Senator, thanks so much for giving us some time this morning. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  Merry Christmas Lawrence. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=203.12s)]
*  Ho ho ho man. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=204.12s)]
*  Merry Christmas to you as well. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=205.12s)]
*  Hey everyone, I'm Emily Campagno. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1P1QWs218&t=206.12s)]
