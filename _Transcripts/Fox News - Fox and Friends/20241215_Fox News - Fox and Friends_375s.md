# 'CAN'T BELIEVE THIS': Maye Musk applauds Dems warming up to DOGE
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs)
*  This morning, turns out Democrats are warming up to the idea of Doge, with liberal lawmakers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=0.0s)]
*  reportedly suggesting their own ideas for slashing costs and government regulations. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=5.68s)]
*  The lone Democrat to join Congress' new Doge caucus predicting, quote, more Dems will join [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=10.36s)]
*  the caucus, doing so get you a voice to fight for the things where there's bipartisan agreement [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=15.44s)]
*  and fight against the irrational things that will probably get proposed. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=20.88s)]
*  Our next guest is a former Democrat who knows Elon Musk better than anyone else. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=24.64s)]
*  And she's very proud of her son. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=30.18s)]
*  And she joins us now, Mayma, welcome. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=34.4s)]
*  So you were a former Democrat. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=35.4s)]
*  You're looking at what's going on with Doge and government spending and how it's out of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=36.72s)]
*  control. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=41.28s)]
*  Give us your thoughts on that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=42.28s)]
*  Well, it is out of control. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=43.28s)]
*  And the more it's revealed, it's just horrifying. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=45.72s)]
*  Yeah, you hear more crazy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  You can't believe this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=51.28s)]
*  And I'm happy that some Democrats really are concerned about that, too, of the waste and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=53.28s)]
*  the spending. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  And some of the projects that your son and V.B.E.K. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  Brahmswami have been highlighting are just mind blowing that we're funding it and that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=63.52s)]
*  we're taxing people out of their homes and out of their ability to take care of themselves [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=67.88s)]
*  for some of these stupid projects. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  But you have a new book out. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=74.56s)]
*  And so many topics. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  I wish I had an hour with you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=77.16s)]
*  This book is called A Woman Makes a Plan. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=79.08s)]
*  So I opened it up and there's a section on beauty, which, of course, I'm going to ask [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=81.66s)]
*  you about. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=84.88s)]
*  A chapter is I love makeup and makeup loves me. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=85.88s)]
*  I really love you. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=88.74s)]
*  Makeup makes a big difference. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=91.74s)]
*  You should have seen me when I arrived. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=94.1s)]
*  It was pretty plain. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=95.58s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=96.58s)]
*  And then they just make me glamorous. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=97.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=98.97999999999999s)]
*  I love it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=99.97999999999999s)]
*  You love it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=100.97999999999999s)]
*  So in this book, people will get to know what? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=101.97999999999999s)]
*  It will be first of all, the adventures in the Kalahari Desert. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=104.62s)]
*  That's what the men love. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=107.82s)]
*  And then it's about modeling and rejection, a lot of that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=108.9s)]
*  And then I'm a dietitian, of course. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=112.98s)]
*  So it's a lot of food and food habits to make you feel healthy, lower your risk for chronic [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=115.02000000000001s)]
*  diseases, which is less sexy than feel healthy. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  And then also then about my children. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=127.38000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=131.02s)]
*  And that's something I wanted to talk to you about. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=132.02s)]
*  So your children, by the way, your son has 12. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=133.82s)]
*  He's the only one that beat my husband on the cabinet with the number of children. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=138.5s)]
*  My husband has nine, Pete Hegs has seven, but yours has 12. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=142.73999999999998s)]
*  And you were recently getting a lot of attention because there was a comedian online who said, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=146.68s)]
*  listen, I get it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=152.18s)]
*  People don't want to have, they're talking about the birth rate, which your son talks [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=153.45999999999998s)]
*  a lot about it declining and the problems for humanity with that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  And you said to his response about it being too expensive to have kids, you said, that's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=159.94s)]
*  not the way to think about this. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=165.66s)]
*  Explain. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=167.18s)]
*  Well, you know, when I had my children, we were in a two bedroom small apartment overlooking [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=168.18s)]
*  a garage. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=175.82s)]
*  And then the next year, I have a second child, we had an apartment with a view. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=177.06s)]
*  And then by the third child, we could get a two bedroom house. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=184.3s)]
*  And you just, you know, you as you move on, you start doing better and better. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=188.34s)]
*  People, you know, you don't have to go to the movies. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=194.3s)]
*  You don't have to go out for dinner. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=197.18s)]
*  You can just spend time with your the most wonderful gifts you can ever have. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=198.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=204.46s)]
*  As a children. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=205.46s)]
*  You didn't feel like you were sacrificing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=206.46s)]
*  Never. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=207.46s)]
*  It didn't occur to me. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=208.46s)]
*  It seems to be a popular term, but it didn't occur to me. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=209.46s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=212.34s)]
*  Because children are an intrinsic value in and of themselves. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=213.34s)]
*  And you're now experiencing seeing your son having this kind of success. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=216.78s)]
*  How do you raise a billionaire? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=221.26000000000002s)]
*  That wasn't his goal. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  His goal was to save the planet and then explore another planet and so that civilization can [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=224.86s)]
*  be saved. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  Of course. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  And so he will need that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=235.42000000000002s)]
*  That billion. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  Does Elon's kids do, we're just having this discussion about the phone and how technology [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=238.42000000000002s)]
*  can interfere with creativity. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=245.06s)]
*  There's a purpose behind it, but it can also interfere with creativity. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=247.98000000000002s)]
*  It can be a time suck. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=251.26s)]
*  It can take people away from relational goals that they must have. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=252.38s)]
*  So what is your thought on the phone and when children should have the phone? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=257.86s)]
*  First of all, I don't care because they're not my children. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=261.78s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=265.26s)]
*  She's left in one on grandmas. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=266.26s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=269.26s)]
*  But if you had a child right now, what would be your thoughts on the phone? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=270.26s)]
*  Well, when my daughter had her twins and I was helping with them, then I lived with them [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=273.26s)]
*  and then I moved to be near them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=277.86s)]
*  I said we can't have them on the iPads and the iPhones all the time until I had to look [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=281.5s)]
*  after them and I said take them, especially on a plane. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=287.82s)]
*  Give them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=291.86s)]
*  There's definitely a place for it, for sure. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=292.86s)]
*  Tell me more about Elon Musk as a child. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=295.86s)]
*  He was just a shy child. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=299.74s)]
*  I said he was a genius. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=302.06s)]
*  Nobody believed me because he was shy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=303.46000000000004s)]
*  Kimberl and Tosca, more outgoing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=307.5s)]
*  And just to let you know, Tosca has her own streaming platform called Passionflix and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=310.06s)]
*  she's now doing an all-nighters doing a vampire romance series. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=315.26s)]
*  I just ran it by you because we always talk about my two sons. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=321.58s)]
*  But you have other kids, I love that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=325.38s)]
*  I have a daughter who's dynamic. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=329.98s)]
*  Well, your son is poised to make a huge difference in government and the way we think about it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=330.98s)]
*  We're excited. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=337.18s)]
*  I know my husband is excited to hopefully get to work with him as well. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=338.18s)]
*  And this book, A Woman Makes a Plan. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=342.78000000000003s)]
*  Just to let you know, it is sold out. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=346.26s)]
*  They are going to republish in January. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=348.26s)]
*  But the audiobook I read. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGYDe50tNCs&t=350.82s)]
