# Kid Rock: 'I finally said, hell yes!'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw)
*  All right, well, let's check in on Steve on his morning walk out in Nashville. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey Steve. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=5.72s)]
*  Hello Rachel, nice talking to you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=8.44s)]
*  Okay, so we're in the Capitol View neighborhood of Nashville right now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=11.08s)]
*  And you know, on Friday's show, we actually had your husband, Sean Duffy, Secretary of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=15.96s)]
*  Transportation, break news about the runway out at Newark. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=21.48s)]
*  Bravo, Mr. Secretary. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=25.12s)]
*  Today, once again, another newsmaker, big star here in Nashville. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=27.08s)]
*  And this is actually somebody who I've known for a long time. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  And he wears a cowboy hat in Nashville. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=36.54s)]
*  But then again, a lot of people do. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=41.12s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Ken Rock. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=42.68s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Very well, thank you. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=49.14s)]
*  You know, Bobby, his real name is Bobby Richie. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=50.14s)]
*  You've called me up before and you've said, let's go on a morning walk. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=55.0s)]
*  Tell people what your morning routine is like. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=57.0s)]
*  Oh man, well, it's changed over the last three to four years. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=60.56s)]
*  Went from a thousand percent rock and roll to, you know, I started off with a core ab [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=65.04s)]
*  13 minute workout, singles pickleball. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=70.4s)]
*  Just your belly? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=72.68s)]
*  13 minutes? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=73.68s)]
*  It's core stretch, core stretch. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=74.68s)]
*  Then singles pickleball, circuit train, red light therapy, I ride my bike in the sauna [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=76.2s)]
*  for 10 minutes, finish it off with a cold plunge and then I intermittent fast. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=81.24s)]
*  Do you have a bike in your sauna? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=84.6s)]
*  I do. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=86.32s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=87.32s)]
*  I can't find third gear. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=88.32s)]
*  I'm like, stop or I'm on six. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  What is the, I hate the cold plunge. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack in there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=98.52s)]
*  The way I figure it, no, it's not enjoyable to jump in that, but you feel so great. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=99.52s)]
*  And cause it wakes you up. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=104.0s)]
*  But I figure it's probably the hardest thing I'm going to do all day. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=105.0s)]
*  And it's out of the way. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=107.84s)]
*  First thing in the morning. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  It's kind of dicey. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=111.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=112.0s)]
*  What do you have for breakfast? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=113.0s)]
*  I don't eat breakfast. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=114.0s)]
*  What are you in? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=115.0s)]
*  I don't eat till 1 PM and I stop at seven. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=117.0s)]
*  It's black water. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=120.12s)]
*  I mean, it's a hydrogen water and black coffee. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=121.12s)]
*  And I do that four, I tried to five days a week, but I always do it four consecutively. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  And then on the weekends I have steak and eggs and I might order a pizza on Sunday or [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  get a burger. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=132.12s)]
*  Now, you and I have gone on walks before and you have told me that you're going out on [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=134.36s)]
*  tour. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  When you go on tour, you actually have to get into shape. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  It's not like you can just go from not being on tour, doing shows. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=144.52s)]
*  These days I do. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=149.72s)]
*  Months later, it's like I've been eating comfort food. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=150.72s)]
*  You've been eating your mom's sloppy joes. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=152.72s)]
*  By the way, mom's watching. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=155.16000000000003s)]
*  Hi mom. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  Love you. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  My mother, actually Susan, we're walking by Club Pilates in this neighborhood. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=158.72s)]
*  Your mom has a Pilates machine, right? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  Doesn't she do Pilates? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=166.92s)]
*  I think she does. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  Mom holds it together very well. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  She does. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=171.0s)]
*  But she's got a recipe in one of our cookbooks. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=172.0s)]
*  She does. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  Actually two recipes. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  Hell of a cook. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  She's a very good cook. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  But tell me about getting into shape to go out on tour. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  You know, I try to stay in shape now all year long. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=181.83999999999997s)]
*  So when it comes to playing shows or whatever that I'm conditioned to do it, you know, I [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  could get away with it when I was younger. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=187.96s)]
*  All that jumping around and carrying on on stage. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  But you know, it makes it so much easier these days at this age. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  Bobby, that lady walker dog would like a selfie. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=195.36s)]
*  You want a selfie? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=197.72s)]
*  Come on over. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=198.72s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=199.72s)]
*  What's up, Bobby? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=200.72s)]
*  How are you? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=201.72s)]
*  Will you take it? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=202.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'll do it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=203.72s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=204.72s)]
*  How are you? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=205.72s)]
*  I'm great. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=206.72s)]
*  How are you, Bob? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=207.72s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=208.72s)]
*  There you go. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=209.72s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=210.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=211.72s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=212.72s)]
*  Very nice. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=213.72s)]
*  Very nice. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=215.72s)]
*  So you have to get in shape to go out and about on the road. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=221.96s)]
*  Now, now, one of the things about you is you are not shy about your politics. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=222.96s)]
*  No. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=228.48s)]
*  How did you become political? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=229.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, the short answer is I just love my country and care too much about it not [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=231.48s)]
*  to be involved. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=236.96s)]
*  But I did wait, you know, years until I say for a rainy day. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=237.96s)]
*  And I have no corporate interests, any of that stuff. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=244.0s)]
*  So I kind of, you know, as the years went on, kind of made myself uncancellable. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  But really, when I really took the deep dive in was, you know, President Trump, when he [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  came down that escalator and I finally said, hell yes, like finally a businessman to run [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  the business of America with common sense. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=262.8s)]
*  And I couldn't be more proud to call him a friend and the things he's doing just putting [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  America first every single day. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  And man, does that dude work. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=271.96s)]
*  Man, and I work. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=273.64s)]
*  I think we have a lot in common in our work ethic. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=275.32s)]
*  He's very busy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  You just mentioned the fact that you put away some money and then you were able to give [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=279.08s)]
*  your opinions. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=284.24s)]
*  That's a problem for a lot of stars. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=285.24s)]
*  They don't want to open their mouth and be political and take a stand because then you [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  hack off half the country. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=292.79999999999995s)]
*  You don't care. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, no, I figured out years ago, you know, I'm going to play to my base. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm not going to worry about, you know, trying to please everyone. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=300.92s)]
*  And I learned that at a young age. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=303.44s)]
*  That's just a recipe that I don't want to use in what I do. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IDWRIj9Lw&t=305.04s)]
