# 'FIVE STEPS AHEAD': Hosts react to Colombia caving to Trump's tariff threat
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks)
*  So Columbia quickly caved into pressure from the White House after tear threats from President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump saying we'll start accepting deportation flights from the U.S. Senior White House correspondent [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=9.52s)]
*  Peter Ducey joins us right now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=16.36s)]
*  Peter, people watch this play out in real time. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=18.04s)]
*  You know, the president put something out on X and true social. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=21.88s)]
*  This thing, you know, the president of Columbia said, OK, I was just kidding. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=27.16s)]
*  And we've been tracking possible tariffs as early as next week on Mexico and on Canada. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  We hadn't heard anything about tariffs on Columbia until the Colombian government turned [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=36.96s)]
*  back to U.S. military planes full of Colombian nationals who had entered this country illegally. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=42.44s)]
*  They were being deported. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  When President Trump caught wind of this, he threatened a 25 percent tariff that would [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=50.2s)]
*  go up to 50 percent after a week on imports from Columbia. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=54.64s)]
*  And that was just too much for the Colombians. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=60.24s)]
*  The foreign ministry in Bogota now telling us Columbia under the direction of President [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  Gustavo Petro has the presidential plane ready to facilitate the return of compatriots who [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=67.16s)]
*  were to arrive in the country today in the morning on deportation flights. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=73.42s)]
*  And so within an hour or so, the White House put their threat on hold. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=78.16s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, the new press secretary, says the fully drafted IEPA tariffs and sanctions [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=83.48s)]
*  will be held in reserve and not signed unless Colombia fails to honor this agreement. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=90.12s)]
*  The visa sanctions issued by the State Department and enhanced inspections from customs will [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  remain in effect until the first plane load of Colombian deportees is successfully returned. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=100.28s)]
*  And it's going to be a pretty impactful trade war because the number one import from Columbia [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  to the United States is coffee. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=113.32s)]
*  But the number three Colombian export to the U.S., something that people would probably [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=115.44s)]
*  notice ahead of Valentine's Day, cut flowers. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=120.0s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  And Peter, to the point about, oh, we're in a fight with Colombia, there goes the price [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=124.96s)]
*  of coffee. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=130.16s)]
*  When people heard Donald Trump say, you know, there's going to be a tariff against Mexico, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  people were saying in the mainstream media and on social media talking about how, are [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=137.04s)]
*  you kidding? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=141.28s)]
*  The price of avocados is going to go up just at the Super Bowl. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=142.28s)]
*  That's when we buy all the avocados. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=145.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=147.08s)]
*  And if you buy some avocados now, chances are they will still be ripe for the Super [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=148.08s)]
*  Bowl in two weeks. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=153.8s)]
*  But it's something that we have not seen from President Trump, where he was talking about [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=155.24s)]
*  tariffs basically as economic policy as a way to get the United States more competitive [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=159.8s)]
*  with the rest of the world that he thinks is ripping the United States off. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=165.8s)]
*  This would be a retaliatory tariff that I can pretty much guarantee the Trump people [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=170.0s)]
*  yesterday were not even tracking these tariffs on Colombia. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  It's something that he heard about and is trying to use the power that he has as president [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  to essentially get people to take these deportees back. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=192.0s)]
*  He's five steps ahead of everybody from the flights out to the countries that are getting [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=193.0s)]
*  them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=197.11999999999998s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=198.11999999999998s)]
*  The other thing is about avocados, you can use old, you just cut out the bruised part, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=199.6s)]
*  number one. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  Number two, the nation should go hummus as a country. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  No, we can do both. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  We can do both. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  You can do both? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  You can do guacamole. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  Wait, on Super Bowl you're going to have hummus? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  Right because it's so hard with you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=211.6s)]
*  What's the matter with you? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=212.6s)]
*  It doesn't break the chip. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=213.6s)]
*  Like you have chips with that much of a spine, they break and then you just stare at the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=214.6s)]
*  broken chip and the hummus. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=217.6s)]
*  That's a lot of chickpeas. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=219.08s)]
*  You can get avocados here in America. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=220.08s)]
*  They grow them in California as well. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=222.44s)]
*  Oh, well, California. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=224.32s)]
*  You know, they're still Americans. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=225.88s)]
*  No, I know, but I'm saying they're having problems. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=228.76s)]
*  They are having problems. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=230.8s)]
*  Better than buying them from a country that doesn't support us. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=231.8s)]
*  Good point, but now they support us. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=233.48s)]
*  Most of them do come from Mexico. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=235.84s)]
*  It only took them a few hours. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=236.84s)]
*  My favorite part about this is that the liberals in the mainstream media were freaking out [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=239.8s)]
*  on social media, saying what is he doing? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=243.52s)]
*  This is not working. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=245.32s)]
*  And within an hour, they completely caved. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  The president released this dossier, blaming America, saying that we're a racist country, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=249.84s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=255.88s)]
*  And after that, minutes later, he recanted and what the president is putting in place, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=256.88s)]
*  which when people may not know, he's saying that when the trucks come across, whether [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=261.76s)]
*  it is by ship or truck, that he's going to slow down CBP when it comes to that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=267.56s)]
*  And they're going to inspect all of their places until they take the migrants back. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=273.08s)]
*  So Columbia, it's a socialist South American country, right? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=279.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=282.36s)]
*  Then Columbia, as soon as Donald Trump does this, Columbia caves. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=283.36s)]
*  So Donald Trump wins. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=286.68s)]
*  The Columbia government, they finally accepted those flights. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=288.16s)]
*  The president of Columbia is now saying, you know what, I don't want them to be transported [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=290.92s)]
*  on your military planes. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=294.68s)]
*  It's inhumane. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=296.68s)]
*  So I'm going to send the presidential plane to pick them up. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=297.72s)]
*  But he did comply and the Columbia foreign minister is traveling to D.C. today for meetings [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=300.44s)]
*  about this agreement and Marco Rubio is involved. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, you know, I read in some news source this morning that apparently this all happened [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=307.36s)]
*  while Donald Trump was playing golf. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  And so essentially he heard about it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=315.36s)]
*  He picked up his phone and he just he fixed it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=317.28s)]
*  He goes to show you how, you know, and we've told you this is man as opposed to a politician. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=320.96s)]
*  This is how you negotiate. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=325.84s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=327.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=328.76s)]
*  They're going to do that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=329.76s)]
*  Most deals done on the golf course anyway. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=330.76s)]
*  I think usually the people are in the foursome. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=331.76s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  But here's ultimately, would you pay an extra quarter on a cup of coffee to send those people [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=339.48s)]
*  back? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=344.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=345.96s)]
*  You know, he's thinking yes, but he didn't have to because ultimately they cave because [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=346.96s)]
*  in addition to I already have a payment plan for my Starbucks store, you look at the coffee, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  you buy the one that's the cheapest. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=355.88s)]
*  And if he slaps tariffs on Columbia, we're going to stop buying their cars. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=357.2s)]
*  A country just go taste his choice. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=360.32s)]
*  It's instant. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=362.08s)]
*  You put it in, you start it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=363.08s)]
*  It's right. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=364.28s)]
*  It's a little different. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=365.28s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=367.0s)]
*  I'm the guy who got half a face on the guy just smelling it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=368.0s)]
*  My mom loved that one. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=370.4s)]
*  I would make it for. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=371.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=372.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=373.84s)]
*  I didn't know you could brew coffee as a child. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=374.84s)]
*  Wasn't Juan Valdez. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=377.64s)]
*  Michael, I had a few scoops. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=378.64s)]
*  No, you just heat the water and you pour it in. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=380.64s)]
*  Juan Valdez was the iconic pitchman for Colombian coffee for decades. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=383.44s)]
*  And we actually had him. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=390.56s)]
*  Do you remember when he was on the show? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=392.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=393.76s)]
*  Like 20 years ago. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=394.76s)]
*  Is that like there's a bunch of Colonel Sanders, there's a bunch of Juan Valdez. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=395.76s)]
*  No, there was one Colonel Sanders. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=396.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=398.23999999999995s)]
*  He actually came up. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=399.23999999999995s)]
*  But then they had people pretending to be one. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=400.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, those were. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=401.67999999999995s)]
*  People who depicted. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=403.16s)]
*  There was one Ronald McDonald, too. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=404.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=405.16s)]
*  Do you ever have your birthday parties at McDonald's? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=406.16s)]
*  Nope. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=407.48s)]
*  All Chuck E. Cheese. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=408.48s)]
*  No, too much meat. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=409.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=410.48s)]
*  So let's talk about what else is happening with illegal immigrants. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=411.48s)]
*  It started in New York, Chicago. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=413.6s)]
*  There's Aurora. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=416.0s)]
*  And Chicago is where Tom Homan was yesterday. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=417.0s)]
*  And Tom Homan was scooping up a lot of legal aliens who were criminals. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=420.68s)]
*  He said, you might be a sanctuary city, but it's not going to stop us. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=423.6s)]
*  So he put his guys out in force and they picked up an enormous amount. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=426.64s)]
*  As of Sunday morning, nine hundred and fifty six arrests, five hundred and fifty four detainers. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=430.68s)]
*  And that was Tom Homan in the basement of a parking garage saying, how are we doing? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=435.48s)]
*  Want to make sure everybody's working together. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=439.76s)]
*  Governor Pritzker thinks he's on the right side of things. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=441.92s)]
*  He's sticking up for the illegal immigrants. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=444.64s)]
*  He's a Democrat. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=446.16s)]
*  Yeah, he's a Democratic governor of Illinois and eventually wants to run for president. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=447.16s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=451.72s)]
*  They're going after people who are law abiding, who are holding down jobs, who have families [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=452.76s)]
*  here who may have been here for a decade or two decades. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=457.52000000000004s)]
*  We're going to stand in the way of an unconstitutional order. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=460.8s)]
*  We'll also stand in the way of them breaking the law in Illinois if they're not following [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  federal law. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=469.16s)]
*  Now, we know that if they show up with warrants to take people away, that we're going to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=470.56s)]
*  hand them over. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=475.6s)]
*  We're going to do what we need to do. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=476.6s)]
*  But we also have a law in the books in Illinois that says that our local law enforcement will [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=478.58000000000004s)]
*  stand up for those law abiding, undocumented people in our state. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=483.3s)]
*  I mean, what do you expect them to show up with? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=488.06s)]
*  You think ICE is just going to people's residence without a detainer request or a final deportation [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=490.54s)]
*  order that's been signed by a judge? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=496.26s)]
*  They know the federal law. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=498.52000000000004s)]
*  You've got to be able to house these people as well before you do the deportation. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=499.52s)]
*  So the whole notion that ICE is just showing up to places without due cause legally is [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=504.46000000000004s)]
*  insulting. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=510.46000000000004s)]
*  You have collateral arrest. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=511.46s)]
*  You have collateral arrest. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=512.46s)]
*  When you show up, you go for somebody. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=513.46s)]
*  And the person next to them is also wanted here illegally. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=514.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=516.74s)]
*  That's fear-mongering. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=517.74s)]
*  They're trying to scare everyone that's doing the right, you know, that might have holding [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=518.74s)]
*  down a good job. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=522.62s)]
*  But Tom Homan said it's a priority basis. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=524.06s)]
*  Right now, the concentration is on public safety threats and national security threats. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=526.68s)]
*  Well, and it wasn't just ICE who showed up over the weekend in Chicago. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=530.34s)]
*  It was also DEA was working in concert with them. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=534.6999999999999s)]
*  It was ATF. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=537.74s)]
*  It was the U.S. Marshals. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=539.3s)]
*  And the most surprising thing I saw yesterday was Dr. Phil. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=541.14s)]
*  Dr. Phil was actually there. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=545.5s)]
*  Is he here illegally? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=547.38s)]
*  He is. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=549.38s)]
*  He was actually streaming the whole thing. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=550.38s)]
*  And he, Tom Homan, made it very clear to Dr. Phil and also to ABC. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=553.2199999999999s)]
*  Look, the people we're going after, not anybody other than, at this point, people who are [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=557.6999999999999s)]
*  illegally and have broken the rules to a profound effect and were convicted or deported and [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=566.18s)]
*  those the first to go. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=572.26s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=574.4599999999999s)]
*  How many MS-13 members are the age of 14 to 17? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=575.4599999999999s)]
*  Many of them. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=579.8199999999999s)]
*  So, look, if it's the national security threat, public safety threat, and what you need to [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=580.8199999999999s)]
*  understand is that case by case, name another agency, another law enforcement agency that [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=585.0999999999999s)]
*  has those type of requirements that they can't walk into a school or doctor's office or on [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=589.38s)]
*  a medical campus. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=593.42s)]
*  No other agencies have those standards. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=594.66s)]
*  These are well-trained officers with a lot of discretion. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=596.38s)]
*  And with constant censor locations, there's still going to be supervised review. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=598.66s)]
*  So it's not like it's an open issue. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=601.9s)]
*  But ICE officers should have discretion to decide if a national security threat or a [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=605.9399999999999s)]
*  public safety threat is in one of these facilities, then there should be an option for them to [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=610.78s)]
*  make the arrest. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=614.2199999999999s)]
*  Obviously, they're doing it to smart right now, going after the criminals. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=615.2199999999999s)]
*  But eventually, guys, they are going to make their way to the people that have been here [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=618.2199999999999s)]
*  for a while. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=621.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=622.66s)]
*  They've been indicted. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=623.9s)]
*  They've had a final deportation order. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=624.9s)]
*  If they had asylum claims, it has been adjudicated and a judge has decided, no, you don't have [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=627.26s)]
*  a proper claim. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=632.66s)]
*  And that's just the law of the land. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=635.02s)]
*  So that's not his problem is not, it's not up to him to do immigration reform. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=636.98s)]
*  No. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=641.9s)]
*  There are things that have to be reformed about the immigration system. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=642.9s)]
*  It takes way too long for legitimate people to work their way through the process. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=644.62s)]
*  I agree. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=648.26s)]
*  And I think you could put an argument is it's also too costly. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=649.26s)]
*  For people that want to come here that we want here, I don't care if it's from Norway [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=652.42s)]
*  or Ghana, the line is too long. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=655.02s)]
*  It takes too long. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=657.22s)]
*  And maybe there's ways to expedite that process. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=658.62s)]
*  At the same time, if you have farm workers that are here illegally for 20 years, maybe [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=661.66s)]
*  there's a situation where they convert to work visas, where they don't become citizens, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=666.66s)]
*  can't reward the behaviors. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=672.06s)]
*  But if they are working and they can't get other people to get those jobs, but that's [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=673.42s)]
*  a couple of years down the line. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=676.82s)]
*  There's over a million people here who have committed some type of crime. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=678.74s)]
*  It's going to take a while just to get them. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=683.02s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=685.98s)]
*  Also, Tom Homan made it clear. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=686.98s)]
*  I'm running out of money. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=688.0600000000001s)]
*  Congress has to give them money. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=689.78s)]
*  All these operations are expensive. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=691.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=692.86s)]
*  Two things. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=693.86s)]
*  One, Ainsley and I talked during that sound bite. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=694.86s)]
*  Dr. Phil is in the country legally. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=697.0600000000001s)]
*  Just make sure. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=699.66s)]
*  That was a joke. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=700.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=702.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=703.26s)]
*  The other thing is you see the story being played out in a lot of mainstream media and [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=704.26s)]
*  essentially what they're trying to do is they're trying to, you mentioned fear mongering. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=708.42s)]
*  What they're trying to say is, okay, it's just a matter of time before they come and [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=712.74s)]
*  get the guy who mows my lawn, who has not broken the rules other than in the country [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=717.2199999999999s)]
*  illegally. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=721.62s)]
*  Or it's the person who cuts my hair. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=722.62s)]
*  Or it's the person who serves the food at my kid's school. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=723.62s)]
*  It's just a matter of time until they come for them. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=726.9s)]
*  That is what they're trying to say. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=731.8s)]
*  But Tom Homan has been very honest all along. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=733.3399999999999s)]
*  The first people we're going after are the ones who are the big troublemakers. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=736.42s)]
*  What about the ones we don't know where they are? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=739.9399999999999s)]
*  What about the people that were on the terror watch list that were let in? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=742.14s)]
*  Hundreds of people. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=744.74s)]
*  We don't know where they are. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=745.74s)]
*  What about all these missing children that have come through? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=746.9s)]
*  And there was a report talking about that the administration has already started to [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=749.4s)]
*  find some of those children as well. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=751.9799999999999s)]
*  The last thing I would say about this, about the people that are doing all these other [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=754.66s)]
*  jobs, they continue to say that Americans don't want these jobs. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=757.62s)]
*  That is not true. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=761.36s)]
*  We don't want to be paid slave labor for a job working in the field. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=762.5s)]
*  We don't want to be paid slave labor for working in a construction site making $6 an hour. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=766.44s)]
*  Maybe if you take the people away that are doing it for slave labor and you have to raise [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=772.9s)]
*  the wages, then we'll be doing those jobs now. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=778.6s)]
*  But right now, we can't compete against $6 an hour. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=781.14s)]
*  It's just not fair. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=784.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=785.34s)]
*  The construction though, they are really light in construction. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=786.34s)]
*  They are really light with farmers. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=788.26s)]
*  We'll have to see the reconfigure things. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=790.46s)]
*  The main thing is seal the border, arrest the criminals before you can even think about [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=793.7800000000001s)]
*  doing any type of immigration reform. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=798.7800000000001s)]
*  But if you get to the point where the criminals are gone and you seal the border, then we [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=802.38s)]
*  got to realize what we need in our country is people because we are a decreasing population, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=806.6800000000001s)]
*  but we're doing better than most western countries. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=812.3000000000001s)]
*  But I think that there's a conversation to be had two years from now after both those [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=814.7800000000001s)]
*  things are done. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=819.06s)]
*  And right now, people are already getting the message to stay away. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=820.2199999999999s)]
*  On January 22nd, there was only 714 people who tried to cross the border illegally. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=823.06s)]
*  714. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=828.6199999999999s)]
*  What were they thinking? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=829.6199999999999s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump made it very clear. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=831.06s)]
*  We're not going to let you in. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=832.8199999999999s)]
*  I know, but that used to be tens of thousands. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=833.8199999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=835.9799999999999s)]
*  But still, 700 is a big number. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=836.9799999999999s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=839.66s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNxlj-tuLks&t=840.66s)]
