# Democrats evacuated from DNC, House offices on lockdown amid anti-Israel rally
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU)
*  All right, let's talk about some news. This is a Fox News alert. Six Capitol police officers are injured after battling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=0.0s)]
*  anti-Israel protesters outside of the DNC headquarters last night. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=6.62s)]
*  Several Democratic lawmakers had to be escorted out and all House offices were placed on lockdown. The man from [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=10.88s)]
*  Tennessee as well, Griff Jenkins is live from Washington. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=18.16s)]
*  Griff, what can you tell us? Well, good morning guys, and you know Lawrence, it was such a contrast. On Tuesday [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=21.36s)]
*  I was out at that nearly 300,000 peaceful [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=26.8s)]
*  pro-Israel folks out there rallying on the mall, but compare it to last night. Look at this video, a violent mob of about 150 [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=31.02s)]
*  pro-Palestinian protesters [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=40.16s)]
*  blockading the doors to the DNC headquarters, demanding a ceasefire while punching and cursing Capitol police officers, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=41.84s)]
*  forcing the U.S. Capitol into lockdown as Ainsley mentioned in the evacuation of lawmakers [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  from the DNC like Congressman Brad Sherman who posted this on social media. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=54.48s)]
*  He said was just evacuated from the DNC after pro-terrorist [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=58.96s)]
*  anti-Israel protesters grew violent, pepper spraying police officers in attempting to break into the building. Now Republican congresswoman [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=63.18s)]
*  Annapolina Luna said quote, my husband [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=71.68s)]
*  newborn and I are in my office in the Capitol which just went into lockdown because of these uncontrolled protesters. Now in the end, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=74.86s)]
*  six police officers sustained injuries. One protester was arrested for assault of an officer, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=82.32s)]
*  yet the protest organizers claimed it was peaceful. Watch. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=88.08s)]
*  The folks in that building tonight, the folks in Democratic leadership have not been listening to the 80% of us from our diverse communities [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=93.6s)]
*  that support a ceasefire and to stop this genocide of Palestinians. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=99.76s)]
*  And instead of being met with leaders engaging with us, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=103.92s)]
*  instead of being met again our peaceful protest we were met by police. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=108.48s)]
*  And something just to note in there that protest organizers saying that they stood outside of the DNC [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=113.84s)]
*  wanting to send a message that 80% of Democrats are for a ceasefire. I just spoke to Republican congressman [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  August Fluger who was in our hallways here. I said what do you make of this? Are all Democrats for a ceasefire? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  He said I was with Democrats [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=131.52s)]
*  Last night when they got locked down in the Capitol and he said the majority of Democrats support Israel. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=133.52s)]
*  Quite a contrast from what those organizers are saying. Guys, I'll send it back to you at the Grand Ole Opry. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=139.68s)]
*  So Griff, it looks like this is political intimidation. These, whether you agree with the Dems or not, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=145.68s)]
*  it looks like these radical activists are trying to get them to change their policy on this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  And I just wonder if the feds plan on doing anything about that. Have you heard anything? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=156.96s)]
*  That's a great question Lawrence and we've heard nothing from [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=162.16s)]
*  the the federal authorities about what they're going to try and do to get it under control. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=165.52s)]
*  But you put your finger on something I think that's important Lawrence and that is the organizers [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=170.32s)]
*  behind this were the Democrat Socialists of America, a protest group. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  But they've been involved with some of these other protests in other cities that have gotten violent and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=179.6s)]
*  involved with some of the actions on college campuses. It's the Democrat Socialists of America as well. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=185.42s)]
*  As the Jewish Voice for Peace group that has come onto the scene since October 7th. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  So we'll see if anything comes of it in terms of a federal response. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=199.12s)]
*  One thing's for sure. It was definitely not what we saw on Tuesday when pro-Israel protesters [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=202.48s)]
*  just wanted to voice their support in a peaceful manner. Guys? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=208.16s)]
*  And we all know a ceasefire would be an utter disaster. Hamas lives to fight another day. And it also the Palestinian people [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=212.96s)]
*  reportedly do not want to be ruled by Hamas. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=220.22s)]
*  They kill your family if you speak up and maybe we're doing the best thing for them to or [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=224.0s)]
*  the IDF is doing the best thing for them too. Griff do you feel safe there? What's the police presence like in DC? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=229.52s)]
*  Well, the police presence is great. And you know, I would just want to point out by the way [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=235.6s)]
*  I was looking through the the ex used to be Twitter feeds and there was a gentleman [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=240.0s)]
*  Who's running for Congress as a Democrat from Arizona for a house seat? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=245.44s)]
*  His name's Andre and he posted thank you to the Capitol police who protected me tonight as I was evacuated [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=250.56s)]
*  In the protesters message. He said was wrong because a ceasefire means one side surrenders [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=258.4s)]
*  And in this case, this would be Israel surrendering after the horrific October 7th attack [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=265.12s)]
*  And that's why he disagreed with the message. This is a Democrat candidate for Congress [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=270.4s)]
*  Right. Benjamin Netanyahu said the same thing [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=276.32s)]
*  A ceasefire is surrendering and we're not going to do that. Right. Griff. Thank you very much [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=279.44s)]
*  you know, and we've been talking over the last 48 hours about why the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=284.24s)]
*  Administration didn't send anybody to that peaceful protest where there were 300 000 people [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=288.46s)]
*  Of course the white house says look the president was going to san francisco. They could have sent the vice president [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=293.04s)]
*  Here's the problem though. I don't think they want to address the issue that uh, this administration has 100 [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=297.84s)]
*  Percent got israel's back because when you look at the demographics a lot of people in the Democratic Party [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=303.84s)]
*  Support the other side and that's one of the reasons and we haven't really seen [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  Any polling since the march, but when you look at joe biden's disapproval the number of people who don't like him, right? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWinhxDOUU&t=316.08s)]
