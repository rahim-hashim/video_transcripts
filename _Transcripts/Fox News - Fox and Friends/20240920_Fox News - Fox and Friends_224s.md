# Fed chairman makes eye-opening admission
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE)
*  Unemployment starting the year at 3.7 percent, now creeping up to 4.2 percent in August. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=0.0s)]
*  And the chairman of the Federal Reserve says one factor is the crisis at our southern border. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=8.16s)]
*  If you're having millions of people come into the labor force then and you're creating 100,000 [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=14.4s)]
*  jobs, you're going to see unemployment go up. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=18.48s)]
*  We understand there's been quite an influx across the borders, and that has actually [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=20.96s)]
*  been one of the things that's allowed unemployment rate to rise. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=26.36s)]
*  Joining us now is co-host of the Big Money Show on Fox Business, Jackie D'Angeles. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=31.4s)]
*  Good to see you, Jackie. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=35.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=36.92s)]
*  So why do you think he said that? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=37.92s)]
*  I mean, he's basically admitting because our southern border is open, they're taking jobs [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=38.92s)]
*  from Americans. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=42.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=43.28s)]
*  This was so interesting that he added it in there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=44.28s)]
*  Let me start by saying Ainsley, I think he cut rates by a half a point because the economy [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  is in worse shape than most people understand. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  I think he has access to data points that we don't necessarily see, and he's threading [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=52.76s)]
*  a needle and saying, I needed to cut not 25 but 50, and I needed to do it now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=56.4s)]
*  Not necessarily playing politics, because if he was playing politics for the Harris [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  camp, he wouldn't have said this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=64.64s)]
*  So you think about just doing some simple math. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=67.08s)]
*  How many people have come into this country? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=70.06s)]
*  Let's use the CBO number. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  They're saying nine million workers have come since the end of 2020. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=73.52s)]
*  So we know it's more than that, but use that number. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=77.18s)]
*  Divide it by the amount of time that Biden and Harris have been in power, and that's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=79.6s)]
*  roughly 200,000 people who are coming in every month. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=83.6s)]
*  We're not creating that many jobs. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  And so ultimately you realize the people who are coming over are usurping jobs from Americans. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  There's extra data that indicates that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=95.36s)]
*  We see it in the unemployment reports. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=97.06s)]
*  And the Democrats love to say, we need the immigration. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=99.32s)]
*  We need these workers to come into our country. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=102.56s)]
*  I'm not necessarily sure that we do at this level. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=105.24s)]
*  Of course we need legal immigrants, but not the extra overflow. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  Well they say native-born American workers, they have lost 1.3 million jobs just the last [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  year alone. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=118.84s)]
*  But foreign-born workers, they've gained 1.2 million jobs in the last year. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=119.96s)]
*  Are these illegals or are these people that were born and now they're here legally? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=130.6s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=131.6s)]
*  And I don't know if Jerome Powell knows. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=132.6s)]
*  And that's why it's so hard to put the pieces of this story together. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=134.76s)]
*  But what those statistics tell you is that native-born Americans are losing jobs and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  they're losing them at a fast clip. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=142.92s)]
*  And so ultimately you think about what we're doing here with the ratios and the proportions [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=145.28s)]
*  of how many people are coming across the southern border illegally, and it's really mind-boggling. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  You guys had an amazing conversation all morning long about communities and their resources [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=153.94s)]
*  and the education system and law enforcement, how everyone is being overburdened. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=158.64s)]
*  It's not just along the southern border, it's everywhere now. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=163.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's so sad to know. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=166.76s)]
*  We remember when the markets crashed, so many friends lost jobs. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=168.98s)]
*  It is so stressful when you don't have a paycheck coming in. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=173.86s)]
*  And so when you look at these numbers, I feel like some of our leaders are not looking out [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=177.0s)]
*  for Americans. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=180.96s)]
*  They're not putting Americans first. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=181.96s)]
*  No, and that brings me to remind everybody at home. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=182.96s)]
*  Ultimately what we're seeing is a situation that was created by this administration. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=186.52s)]
*  And they hiked inflation up to 9%. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=190.58s)]
*  They really hurt the average American. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=192.82000000000002s)]
*  And just because the stock market went up yesterday, that doesn't mean that we're not [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=194.88000000000002s)]
*  going to see tough times ahead. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=198.62s)]
*  Ultimately rates coming down, those savers, those retirees, they're going to be hurt. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=200.68s)]
*  Jackie, thank you so much. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=205.54000000000002s)]

*  All right, have a great weekend, Jackie, and a good show. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuwNF-98MpE&t=210.66000000000003s)]
