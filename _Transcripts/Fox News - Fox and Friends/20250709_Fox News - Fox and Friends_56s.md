*  And these are these new changes to what goes into the food that we're eating. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=0.0s)]
*  And now there's a candy maker pushing back. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=5.0s)]
*  It's Mars, in fact, pushing back on the changes demanded by Maha. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  And a Mars spokesperson is telling Fox Business, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=13.0s)]
*  at this time we have not yet identified fully effective solutions [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=15.6s)]
*  and believe it is a premature to make commitments [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=19.2s)]
*  until we are certain they can be fulfilled. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  This is, of course, pertaining to food dyes and other things. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=23.6s)]
*  We'll continue our efforts and anticipate being able to offer consumers [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=26.0s)]
*  more choice in the near future. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=29.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, it's important to underline that all of our products [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=30.8s)]
*  continue to be safe to enjoy and meet the high standards [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=33.2s)]
*  and applicable regulations set by food safety authorities. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=36.0s)]
*  I don't know about you guys, but since all of these revelations [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=39.4s)]
*  of, you know, all the different kind of dyes [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=42.6s)]
*  and synthetic ingredients in our foods, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=45.0s)]
*  you start to look at these labels and you say, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=47.8s)]
*  oh my gosh, it's in absolutely everything. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfh9ty0nBk&t=50.0s)]
