# Trump surges to sizable lead in top pollster's forecast
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE)
*  And speaking of former President Donald Trump happening today, he will return to the Commonwealth [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=0.0s)]
*  of Pennsylvania for a Fox News town hall tonight at nine with Sean Hannity. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=4.96s)]
*  Yeah, I remember the debate was supposed to be tonight and Kamala said no and he said [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=9.8s)]
*  yes to a town hall. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  And Vice President Kamala Harris begins debate camp to prepare in Pittsburgh tomorrow ahead [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=14.56s)]
*  of her first face-to-face matchup with Donald Trump next week. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=19.88s)]
*  Mark Merida is live at the White House. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=23.0s)]
*  Hey Mark. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=24.84s)]
*  Lawrence, Steve Ainsley and Brian, good morning friends. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=25.84s)]
*  We are less than a week out for the first and potentially only presidential debate of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=28.16s)]
*  these two candidates this cycle. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=32.36s)]
*  And while they will be taking time to prepare right now, they're also reaching out to voters [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  in swing states. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=38.28s)]
*  Later today, Vice President Harris, she will be in New Hampshire talking about her economic [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=39.56s)]
*  plans for small businesses. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=44.16s)]
*  Former President Trump, he'll be taking questions here on Fox. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=46.04s)]
*  The latest prediction from data guru Nate Silver shows Trump still with a sizable advantage [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=49.16s)]
*  in the electoral contest with a 56% chance of winning the highest he's seen since late [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=54.2s)]
*  July. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=59.52s)]
*  Trump also leading with Hispanic voters on an interesting issue on handling immigration. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=60.52s)]
*  Of course, an issue that is central to this election cycle. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=65.16s)]
*  Still Harris surrogates say it's important for her not to pivot too much away from her [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=69.04s)]
*  base. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=73.0s)]
*  I think it's as simple as letting Kamala be Kamala. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=74.0s)]
*  She has her own views. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=77.98s)]
*  We are all different, even if we've been a part of an administration, even if we're in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=79.54s)]
*  the same political parties, we all have different nuances, different ways that we were raised, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=83.92s)]
*  different things that we feel more passionately about. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=89.04s)]
*  I think it could even be just an issue of say focus. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=92.68s)]
*  One word that we've heard so much about the last couple of weeks is momentum. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=97.48s)]
*  The Harris campaign Democrats insist they have it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=100.68s)]
*  There's a new memo out from Trump World insisting they've got the real momentum. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  They point to support from people like Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, Tulsi Gabbard, as well [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=106.56s)]
*  as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to show that they have a broader coalition of people that may [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=110.72s)]
*  appeal to voters in these swing states. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  So everybody fighting for that momentum. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=116.88s)]
*  Steve Anzley, Brian and Lawrence, back to you guys. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=118.92s)]
*  Thanks, Mark. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=121.12s)]
*  We'll see what happens after the debate because it could be the one and only debate. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=122.12s)]
*  That's what it looks like now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=124.52s)]
*  And it looks like Philippe Reigns has decided to or has been asked to help out Kamala Harris [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=125.52s)]
*  to prepare. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=131.12s)]
*  It looks like she's going to go to debate camp, but she's still going to do some appearances [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=132.12s)]
*  in Pennsylvania, unlike Joe Biden who just assaulted himself away for two weeks. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=135.64s)]
*  And that was a disaster. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=140.12s)]
*  And the question is, will Joe Biden? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=141.56s)]
*  This was a question yesterday. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  Will Joe Biden be helping out? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  Why would you want the worst debater ever to help out? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=145.8s)]
*  And he destroyed his whole career last time he helped out. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=149.08s)]
*  And someone's got to stand up on the Democratic side and tell Joe Biden to bow out. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=152.8s)]
*  He talked more than Kamala Harris. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  Nobody wants to see him. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=159.36s)]
*  The union vote is going to go Democrat anyway. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  No one wants to see him on the campaign trail. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=163.36s)]
*  He's making less sense than ever. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  His anecdotes go on forever. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=167.0s)]
*  None of which are based on fact. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=168.6s)]
*  So to me, James Carville says you have to turn the page from the Biden administration. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=170.48s)]
*  What the Trump people have to do is make sure she stays with the Biden administration. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=174.72s)]
*  The problem is her record is the Biden administration's record. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=178.0s)]
*  Her record as a senator was even more left than Bernie Sanders. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=181.76s)]
*  So it's hard for her to change her positions and walk away, especially with the voters [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=185.84s)]
*  that are informed. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=190.28s)]
*  It's hard to be the change the page candidate when you were part of that book. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, ultimately. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=196.96s)]
*  So it's one other thing Lucas just mentioned. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=198.56s)]
*  R.F.K. Junior, you know, he did endorse Donald Trump about 10 days ago. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=202.28s)]
*  And since then, he has been trying to get off the ballot in all these battleground states. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=207.16s)]
*  Yesterday, he had sued in Michigan to get his name off the ballot in Michigan. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=212.72s)]
*  A judge dismissed the case. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=218.28s)]
*  So his name is going to continue on the ballot in that swing state. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  All right. Multiple suspects with possum. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=223.84s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTe7KQHcPE&t=225.84s)]
