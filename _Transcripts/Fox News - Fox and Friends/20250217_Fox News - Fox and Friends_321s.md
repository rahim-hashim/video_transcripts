# McEnany: This is one of CNN's worst questions ever
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg)
*  They have literally taken the mayor of New York City, who was facing and is facing serious [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=0.0s)]
*  charges of bribery, which were going to be expanded, and they have turned him into their [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=7.48s)]
*  own political pawn. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=12.48s)]
*  This is an outrageous violation of the rules of prosecutors. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=14.38s)]
*  It is an outright extortion. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  Democrats alleging that criminal charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams were dropped [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=25.52s)]
*  in exchange for his cooperation on immigration, even after Adams denied those claims on this [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=29.42s)]
*  show. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=35.620000000000005s)]
*  Think about my attorney, Alex Spiro. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  Imagine him going inside saying that the only way Mayor Adams is going to assist in immigration, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=40.1s)]
*  which I was calling for since 2022, is if you drop the charges. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  That's quid pro quo. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=52.34s)]
*  That's a crime. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=53.34s)]
*  It took her three weeks to report in front of her a criminal action? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=55.34s)]
*  Come on, this is silly. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=59.74s)]
*  I think that's ridiculous, meaning Mayor Adams met a couple months ago. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=60.74s)]
*  I think it was probably eight, nine weeks ago we met and we had the same discussion. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=64.22s)]
*  We talked about getting a presence in Rikers Island. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=70.78s)]
*  Well, joining us now to discuss is counselor to the president, Alina Habba. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=73.14s)]
*  Alina, it's a pleasure to speak with you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=77.58000000000001s)]
*  And you know, looking at this with Eric Adams, I just had to laugh when I hear Amy Klobuchar [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=80.22s)]
*  call him a political pawn. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=85.46s)]
*  Are you a political pawn for complying with federal immigration law? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=87.88s)]
*  The only political pawns that exist in the state of New York are the DAs and AGs that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=94.26s)]
*  are literally interfering in what the president has ordered. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=99.14s)]
*  And let's not forget something, Kayleigh, you bring up a great point. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=102.72s)]
*  This man was prosecuted because he was anti-sanctuary city policies. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=106.82s)]
*  He wanted New York to be safe. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=114.1s)]
*  He said, I'm going to protect the people of New York. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=115.74s)]
*  That is the job I was given. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, wow, he's prosecuted under charges and gone after. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  I can't imagine anybody else that's happened to. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=125.3s)]
*  That's the crime. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=128.22s)]
*  That is the crime. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=129.4s)]
*  So now he comes in and he says, I'm going to cooperate and do exactly what I've been [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=130.5s)]
*  saying I wanted to do for months before they prosecuted me and persecuted me. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=134.76s)]
*  And I'm going to help clean up the city of New York, which is a disaster as we know. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=138.92s)]
*  Alina, I think that's a fantastic point that you make. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=142.88s)]
*  The Biden DOJ, they had a history of going after political enemies from pro-life protesters, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=145.64s)]
*  who I spoke with and interviewed, to, as you very well know because you represented him, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=151.16s)]
*  your client, Donald J. Trump, who is now the president of the United States. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=156.0s)]
*  Then you get to Eric Adams. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=160.06s)]
*  And Tom Homan made an important point. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=161.7s)]
*  He said, we met in December and we talked about opening this place on Rikers. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=163.28s)]
*  But yet there's this bombshell meeting. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=169.12s)]
*  They say this all took place last week. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=171.0s)]
*  They met in December and spoke about this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=173.16s)]
*  It's absolutely true. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=177.6s)]
*  And you know, Amy, in particular, she she she I was listening to her at the FBI confirmation [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=179.2s)]
*  hearing for Cash Patel. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=184.24s)]
*  She's got some real anger issues. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=185.84s)]
*  I don't know where that's coming from, because all we're trying to do and all President Trump [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=187.36s)]
*  is ordering is safety protection, border security, fentanyl crisis to go down, economy to go [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=192.96s)]
*  up. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  That's what we're working on here, getting American people jobs. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  So to get angry about that is just comical to me. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=203.72s)]
*  To say that Eric Adams, how dare he cooperate with President Trump is comical to me. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=207.12s)]
*  Perhaps he should be singing songs outside protesting instead of working for the American [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=211.8s)]
*  people like some of the other Democrat partners over there. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=215.64s)]
*  But he's not. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=219.64s)]
*  He's going to work and he's pulling the America First agenda and working on getting New York [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  to a better place. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=225.88s)]
*  And I commend him. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=226.92s)]
*  But to then say, well, there's collusion, there's this that the only collusion that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  happened was was when they were prosecuting him and Donald Trump. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=230.92s)]
*  And we know that all too well. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=234.0s)]
*  Alina, I want to bring in Dana Bash with one of the worst questions I think I've heard [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=235.0s)]
*  asked. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=239.48s)]
*  Let's listen to this. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=240.48s)]
*  If he doesn't do the things that you want him to do, would you be OK with DOJ reopening [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=242.92s)]
*  its investigation into him? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=247.6s)]
*  Should they do that? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=249.96s)]
*  That's out of that's out of my lane. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=251.96s)]
*  I'm a border. I care about the border. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=253.68s)]
*  So let DOJ do what they do. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=255.08s)]
*  I care about removing public safety threats from the country. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=256.72s)]
*  I mean, Alina, I thought Trump appointed Tom Homan to fix the border. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=260.2s)]
*  Did I miss something? Is he now a DOJ? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think she must have thought Tom was Pam, which I wouldn't put above, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=268.68s)]
*  Dana. Look, at the end of the day, Kaylee, what her question is absurd for another reason. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=272.0s)]
*  If he doesn't do what you want him to do, will you prosecute him? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  Let's say it was Pam Bondi. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=284.12s)]
*  Let's say that's the question she asks me. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=285.68s)]
*  That question in itself tells you the way they think. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=288.04s)]
*  If you do not do what we want you to do, we will come after you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=290.64s)]
*  No, that's what you did to Mayor Adams. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=293.6s)]
*  You did that. He didn't want to do what the Biden administration wanted. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=295.68s)]
*  And they came after him. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=299.48s)]
*  It's the way they think. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=300.68s)]
*  It was actually a very telling question in itself, never mind to the wrong person. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=301.72s)]
*  Counselor to the president, Alina Haba, thank you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  Thanks, Kaylee. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzr2MzOd4hg&t=309.36s)]
