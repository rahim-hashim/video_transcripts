# Bernie Sanders tries to leave interview after refusing to answer AOC question
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU)
*  But it looks like Bernie and AOC are getting a massive crowd. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=0.0s)]
*  It looks like all the energy, if you do have energy in the Democratic Party, is with them. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=4.92s)]
*  And this is Bernie Sanders talking about. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=9.72s)]
*  He melts down here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=11.72s)]
*  Alexandria is extraordinary. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=14.72s)]
*  I am so impressed by her work in Congress and her, just she inspires young people all [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=17.12s)]
*  over the country. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=22.84s)]
*  Would you like to see her join in the Senate? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=23.84s)]
*  Right now, we have, as I said, just a whole lot of people in the Congress. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=26.24s)]
*  Okay, Jonathan, thanks. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  Wait, I got one more. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  I got one more that's important. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  Well, I asked you, okay, you know, you want to do nonsense, do nonsense. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=32.8s)]
*  No. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=36.4s)]
*  I don't want to talk about inside the beltway stuff. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=37.4s)]
*  I got 32,000 people. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  So there is an intergenerational war going on right now inside of the party. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, like it or not, she's a rising star. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=45.64s)]
*  Not a rising star, she is a star in the party. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=49.92s)]
*  And then Chuck Schumer, as you said, they're projecting all their grief onto him, all their [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  frustrations onto him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=55.96s)]
*  And so there's this question, is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez going to run for Chuck Schumer? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=57.6s)]
*  I think Alexandria would like to do that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=63.08s)]
*  Sandy likes that position. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=66.04s)]
*  But she is not, Chuck Schumer is still going to stick around. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=67.64s)]
*  So that's the battle Bernie Sanders put in the middle and saying, I'm not going here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=70.84s)]
*  I like it though. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=75.16s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=76.16s)]
*  It's just amazing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=77.16s)]
*  Out of all the things to start away with, hey, you know the woman you just were lauding [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=78.16s)]
*  and praising? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=81.8s)]
*  You think she'll run for the Senate? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=82.8s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=83.8s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=84.8s)]
*  Get out of here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=86.64s)]
*  I'm going to uncomb my hair again. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=87.64s)]
*  So he goes out to big crowds. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=88.64s)]
*  I think the bigger story is this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=90.08s)]
*  Does she have charisma? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=91.56s)]
*  Does she have presence? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=92.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=93.56s)]
*  Does she have personality? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=94.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=95.56s)]
*  But everything she stands for does not resonate with the nation. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=96.56s)]
*  No. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=97.56s)]
*  And the thing is, that's got to scare you. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=98.56s)]
*  Bernie Sanders scared them for eight years because he got popular. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=101.56s)]
*  And they know nationally his socialist principles, the lack of meritocracy, the lack of accomplishment. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Bernie Sanders has not done anything of worth. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=110.28s)]
*  She is one of the least productive members of Congress. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=112.64s)]
*  She gets publicity. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=115.16s)]
*  She doesn't get legislation done. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=116.16s)]
*  She's not a workhorse. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  She's a show horse. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  And this show horse gets big crowds but can't do anything. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  This is the best thing to happen to Republicans because she will not be a national figure. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=124.16s)]
*  And he is not a national. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=131.16s)]
*  He's never done anything. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=133.56s)]
*  The scariest thing for Bernie Sanders is to actually become president. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=134.72s)]
*  And she'll have to actually do something besides vilify billionaires and success. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=137.16s)]
*  I'm going to push back. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=141.96s)]
*  She is a national figure. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=143.24s)]
*  She's lone. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  She's a national. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=145.32000000000002s)]
*  And in her district, people voted for her and for Donald Trump. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  And she actually wanted to find out why. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  Now, I'm not defending Alexander Kyrsten. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, I have great footage. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  Maybe we'll air it here on the show. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  We aired it this past weekend. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  I went to her district last week. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  A lot of people don't know who the heck she is. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  They said, we haven't seen her here since she was like this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  I get it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  You're right. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=167.32000000000002s)]
*  She's a show horse in that regard. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  But she does hit populist notes. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  And so you have the populist left that she hits along with Bernie Sanders. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=170.4s)]
*  And you have the populist right in MAGA and Donald Trump. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=175.4s)]
*  Chuck Schumer represents the establishment. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=179.4s)]
*  And that's the tension that you're seeing there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=181.4s)]
*  And I don't know how it's going to shake out. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=183.4s)]
*  But I would never underestimate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=185.4s)]
*  Because look at who she took out to get that seat. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=187.4s)]
*  Chuck Schumer should be worried. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=190.4s)]
*  That's the last thing she did of purpose. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=191.4s)]
*  Because she was a bartender and Joe Crowley was ignoring his town. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=193.4s)]
*  And Joe Crowley was somebody who was going to be speaker. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=196.4s)]
*  And she knows a heck of a win. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  But since that time, she's said nothing except keep Amazon from revitalizing [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  Long Island City. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, since she's done, she doesn't show up for anything. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  She stands for the New Green Deal. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  That's her idea. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  It was a disaster. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  She's very street savvy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  It's going to be a huge debate on the future of the Democratic Party. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVz-AR0j9BU&t=215.48000000000002s)]
