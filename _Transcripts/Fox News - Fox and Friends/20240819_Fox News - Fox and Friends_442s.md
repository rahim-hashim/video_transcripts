# Black Chicago voters unsure on supporting Kamala Harris
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE)
*  Let's talk about what's happening in Chicago where Lawrence is. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=0.0s)]
*  In terms of what's happened under the Biden-Harris administration, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=3.48s)]
*  when it comes to crime, it's up 11%. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  That's in the year leading up to this year, until violent crime. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Also, when you look at housing, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=13.8s)]
*  when you look at what they're supposed to bring to the city, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=16.84s)]
*  you see people boarding up their houses, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=18.68s)]
*  people concerned about the protest of 100,000 plus. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=20.64s)]
*  They're worried that there's 1,700 less cops in uniform now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=24.76s)]
*  They're concerned they've got 400 cops from other cities [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=28.8s)]
*  who have to come in to help out. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=32.24s)]
*  So this is an example of a liberal city [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=34.28s)]
*  run by a liberal Democrat and Democrats that's gone awry. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=37.84s)]
*  This is not a great example of what we will do [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=41.84s)]
*  if we give you the keys to the country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  It's the audacity for me. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=45.84s)]
*  How many years have I been covering the violence in Chicago? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=47.72s)]
*  How many kids, how many parents I've sat down with [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=50.72s)]
*  that talk about their kids being murdered? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  How many pleas have they said, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=55.64s)]
*  we need more cops on the street to go after these criminals? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=57.28s)]
*  And all of a sudden, when the rich, powerful, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=60.84s)]
*  and well-connected want to host a convention, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  then you send the cavalry? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  There were five people that were shot and killed [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=67.08s)]
*  in Chicago over the weekend. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=69.48s)]
*  It happens every single weekend, every single holiday. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=70.84s)]
*  And they've been begging, begging, begging, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=73.84s)]
*  please send us more help. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=75.64s)]
*  Please have the National Guard on standby. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  But because all of the Democrats are in town, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=78.88s)]
*  and they are, the people that wanted to fund the police, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=82.04s)]
*  by the way, all of a sudden need the police [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  to protect their tails because there's 100,000 protesters [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=85.8s)]
*  expected to be here, all of a sudden, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=90.04s)]
*  they care about the issue. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=92.44s)]
*  I had Miss Monique Jacobs, her son was killed, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  still no calls, no one gives her any updates. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=96.6s)]
*  This is what she had to say about it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=99.2s)]
*  We're losing babies. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=102.0s)]
*  You know, we're not losing the elderly as fast [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=103.68s)]
*  as we're losing our young people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  They're not even getting a chance to grow up. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=110.04s)]
*  I'll never know what it feels like [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=112.12s)]
*  to have a grandchild from him. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=113.44s)]
*  Like, we're losing our future. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=115.44s)]
*  What do you want to hear from all these leaders? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=118.64s)]
*  I want to know what they're gonna do [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  to protect our communities. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=122.24s)]
*  It's everywhere, but my focus is here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=124.52s)]
*  This is my home, being here all my life. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=127.36s)]
*  I want to know what they're gonna do to bring justice [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=130.0s)]
*  to the parents that are losing their kids. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=132.2s)]
*  Like, what are you gonna say to them? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=134.72s)]
*  Well, I'm sorry, it's not working. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=137.2s)]
*  How about they start, guys, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  with what they do for themselves? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=141.11999999999998s)]
*  I mean, they know how to protect themselves. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=142.88s)]
*  We see what they're doing at the convention today, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  this week, so why aren't you providing [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  the people of Chicago with that same standard of protection? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=150.76s)]
*  They're spending 400 million over the last two years [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  on illegal immigrants. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=156.72s)]
*  They have, by the way, they have 1,390 shooting incidents [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  so far this year, 344 murders, 5,480 robberies, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  1,217 sexual assaults, and this is where the Democrats [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  want to display their four days of fun. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=170.84s)]
*  It's kind of bizarre that they would want to underline [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=172.88s)]
*  this type of performance. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=175.48s)]
*  Lawrence, what's sad, too, is when you look at those five [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=176.64s)]
*  that you talk about, one was in their 30s, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=179.04s)]
*  one was in their late 20s. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=181.0s)]
*  These are young people, and she said, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=182.84s)]
*  I'll never meet my son's grandchildren. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  He'll never have children. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=186.84s)]
*  She said she's having to describe this [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=188.24s)]
*  or explain this to her other kids. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=189.84s)]
*  She wants to be able to cry, and it's really, really hard, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=191.32s)]
*  but she's trying to be strong for her other children. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=194.16s)]
*  I mean, imagine going through that as a parent, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=197.32s)]
*  and we're seeing that time after time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=199.4s)]
*  You've interviewed so many of them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  The little kids that are shot at their family barbecue [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=204.56s)]
*  on their front lawn are in their backyard, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  and they're killed right there on the sidewalk [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=208.96s)]
*  in front of their grandmother's house. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=210.4s)]
*  It's just heartbreaking. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=211.72s)]
*  I wish they would do something about this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=213.16s)]
*  Ultimately, they're having the DNC in Chicago [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=214.84s)]
*  because it's a reliably Democratic stronghold. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=217.52s)]
*  However, Lawrence went back to church yesterday [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=221.08s)]
*  where Cory Brooks is and spoke to some of the parishioners [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=224.24s)]
*  there, and things seem to be changing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  So Pastor, you got the DNC that is here this week. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=233.44s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=237.27999999999997s)]
*  It's kind of bittersweet. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=238.6s)]
*  I'm glad for the city of Chicago [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=239.48s)]
*  that we get to host a major convention. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  The bitter part of it is that I don't agree [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  with any of the principles, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  and so the policies that they use, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=246.76s)]
*  doesn't benefit our community. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=251.11999999999998s)]
*  What do you think is the number one issue [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=253.2s)]
*  facing Chicago right now? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, definitely the number one issue is the violence [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=256.56s)]
*  in Chicago, the gun violence. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=259.6s)]
*  Violence. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=261.64s)]
*  The economy is a big, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=262.48s)]
*  it's a big question mark, you know? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=264.64s)]
*  You go to the grocery store, you know, eggs, bread, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  just small items are large in price now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  I think for my congregation and for others, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=277.32s)]
*  it's kind of changing a little bit [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=279.72s)]
*  because so many people don't agree with the policies. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=281.08s)]
*  And so I think there's definitely growth in my church [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=285.56s)]
*  as far as being more independent in their thinking. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  I see that throughout the community as well. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=292.56s)]
*  I believe the conservative principles are much better [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=294.88s)]
*  for us as a nation and for us as a people. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=298.2s)]
*  Neither side has done really well. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=300.8s)]
*  You're not pleased with any side? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=303.96s)]
*  No. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=305.4s)]
*  Where are you leaning right now [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=306.24s)]
*  when it comes to the presidency? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=307.24s)]
*  Probably toward Kamala. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=310.76s)]
*  I'm under side. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=312.8s)]
*  I'm gonna say at this point, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=313.92s)]
*  I don't know who's best [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=316.16s)]
*  because we haven't really heard their plans or intentions, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=319.32s)]
*  how to solve the issues. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=323.68s)]
*  My vote would be Kamala Harris. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  It'd be historical for one, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=326.68s)]
*  you know, first black female president. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=328.04s)]
*  Does that put extra weight on your decision [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=329.88s)]
*  this election time? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=332.68s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  None at all? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=335.68s)]
*  No, no. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=336.6s)]
*  Yes, there's definitely a lot more pressure. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  I wanna hear more about what she's gonna do [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=341.92s)]
*  because being black is one thing, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=345.16s)]
*  but we've had black people to disappoint us. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=347.32s)]
*  Being a woman is one thing, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=349.64000000000004s)]
*  but we've had women to disappoint us. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=351.56s)]
*  So I think the main theme is what is your platform? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=353.56s)]
*  My thing is it's about time for the black community [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=357.6s)]
*  to start looking at the Republican party. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=360.68s)]
*  The Republican party is pro-family, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=362.48s)]
*  they're pro-business, they're pro-educations, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=364.32s)]
*  pro-choice, I mean, come on. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=367.16s)]
*  It's time to do something a little bit different. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=368.8s)]
*  I hate identity politics. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  The fact that people believe that you have to vote [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=372.12s)]
*  for a person just because they're black [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=373.84s)]
*  or just because they're a woman [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=375.24s)]
*  is totally opposite of what we need to be doing. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=376.84s)]
*  We need to make sure that we vote for people [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=380.47999999999996s)]
*  that align with our policies. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=382.52s)]
*  So earlier in the show, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=384.32s)]
*  I talked about the stuff that worries me. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  I wanna talk about what actually encourages me. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=386.88s)]
*  Two things, the people that are on the South side [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=391.35999999999996s)]
*  of Chicago that I spoke with yesterday [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=393.56s)]
*  are saying the same thing that we're hearing [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=396.28s)]
*  in diners all over America, right? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=398.59999999999997s)]
*  In the middle of America especially. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  They're saying things aren't going well, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=402.32s)]
*  the economy, the economy. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=404.04s)]
*  I notice it when I go to the grocery store. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=405.44s)]
*  The second thing that encouraged me is that [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=407.32s)]
*  there's still a lot of undecided voters. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  And the question is, who is the candidate [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=411.72s)]
*  that's gonna paint the best message [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=414.16s)]
*  that there's gonna be a greater America? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=416.8s)]
*  We'll have to see. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=418.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, we still got a lot of time, guys. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=420.0s)]
*  Right, I know the other, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  the year ticket in Chicago running on joy. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=423.76s)]
*  There's gonna be a lot of joy. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=427.24s)]
*  Yeah, because there's so much joy going on right now. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=428.36s)]
*  No kidding, listen. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=430.72s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=431.56s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbYb3o2GiE&t=432.40000000000003s)]
