*  Islamophobia also bad too [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38r2aqtKIdc&t=230.68s)]
*  Would you have to understand too is these people were coming out ripping down signs of hostages the day after October 7th? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38r2aqtKIdc&t=232.12s)]
*  When people were putting up after the massacre that killed over a thousand innocent people and took over 200 hostage [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38r2aqtKIdc&t=239.72s)]

*  Columbia School of Parsons design of all places the new school NYU and City College [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38r2aqtKIdc&t=272.96000000000004s)]

*  About the Trump trial escorting the former president in and out of court the protesters that are around there. We cannot do this [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38r2aqtKIdc&t=284.62s)]
*  They are really concerned about what's gonna happen in this summer [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38r2aqtKIdc&t=291.6s)]
