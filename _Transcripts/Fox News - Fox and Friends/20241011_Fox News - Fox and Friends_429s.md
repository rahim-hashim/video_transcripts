# 'The pictures don't lie': White House ripped for storm response
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w)
*  Okay, President Biden is once again pushing back against criticism of the government's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=0.0s)]
*  response to Hurricane Helene. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=5.68s)]
*  Biden is calling it misinformation. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Biden's also ripping President Trump. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=9.8s)]
*  It's almost his sole focus. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=12.32s)]
*  It's bizarre. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=13.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas insists FEMA will need more money after Hurricane [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=14.56s)]
*  Milton. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=18.88s)]
*  Mark Meredith is live at the White House. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=19.88s)]
*  Mark, so what are they upset about at the White House right now, Mark? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=22.76s)]
*  Lawrence, Steve Ansley and Brian, good morning, friends. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=27.720000000000002s)]
*  What they're upset about is what they claim has been a spinning of the truth about the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  disaster recovery effort that's been underway ever since Hurricane Helene hit six states [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=33.02s)]
*  just a few weeks ago. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=37.58s)]
*  Today, we are going to get another update from President Biden on the government's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=38.72s)]
*  disaster recovery as we talked about these two major storms which have caused widespread [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=42.64s)]
*  destruction across the South. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=46.88s)]
*  We know that the government is in the process of opening more FEMA disaster recovery centers, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=49.0s)]
*  which will help communities most impacted by Hurricane Milton. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=53.92s)]
*  The president says survivors of Helene, which tore through those six states, are also getting [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=56.96s)]
*  the help they need. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=60.88s)]
*  Former President Trump has repeatedly accused Biden and Vice President Harris of poor disaster [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=62.4s)]
*  recovery management. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=67.64s)]
*  And on Thursday, Biden fired back, claiming Trump is spinning the truth. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=73.6s)]
*  Mr. President Trump, former President Trump, get a life, man. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  Help these people. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=83.32s)]
*  We don't know when President Biden may have traveled to Florida to meet with first responders. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=85.52s)]
*  We are hearing from the Homeland Security Secretary who says right now the government [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=89.74s)]
*  has the money it needs to provide immediate assistance. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=93.36s)]
*  We have the resources to respond to the immediate needs of individuals impacted by Hurricane [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=97.6s)]
*  Helene and Hurricane Milton and the associated. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=103.56s)]
*  That being said, we will need additional funds and we implore Congress when it returns to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=107.88s)]
*  in fact fund FEMA as is needed. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=116.12s)]
*  The money issue keeps coming up. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=120.34s)]
*  Here's a look at what FEMA has been spending your tax dollars on with 31 billion dollars [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=121.84s)]
*  appropriated for the fiscal year. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=126.56s)]
*  344 million dollars so far going to Hurricane Helene. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=128.76s)]
*  That number expected to rise. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=131.8s)]
*  You see the money that was spent on the pandemic and also money that was spent on addressing [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=133.12s)]
*  the U.S. southern border crisis. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=137.54000000000002s)]
*  The White House says more money is urgently needed for the SBA. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=139.46s)]
*  That's the Small Business Administration. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=142.46s)]
*  They also provide disaster recovery loans. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=144.02s)]
*  As of right now, guys, there's no indication that Congress plans to return to Washington [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  before the November election. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=150.46s)]
*  Steve Ainsley, Brian, I'll expect you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=152.78s)]
*  I just don't understand. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=154.5s)]
*  The fiscal year is eight days old. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=155.66s)]
*  They're already out of money. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=157.18s)]
*  Didn't they plan literally for a rainy day? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=158.54000000000002s)]
*  The government's saying now that they're not out of money because this has been a mixed [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=162.3s)]
*  messaging, Brian, that's come up all week because we originally heard back when Helene [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=165.26s)]
*  was happening that they didn't think they'd even have enough money to survive the next [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=168.38s)]
*  hurricane. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=171.94s)]
*  Now, obviously, that we've had Milton come through. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=172.94s)]
*  The government changing its story just a little bit saying we've got the money for right now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=174.86s)]
*  And the president was asked about this just yesterday saying, well, wait, what's happening? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=179.06s)]
*  Are we out of money or are we okay with money? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=182.74s)]
*  And the indication was he was talking about the SBA, not necessarily FEMA. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=184.9s)]
*  Which is out of money. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=188.58s)]
*  Well, so it's a little confusing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=189.58s)]
*  In the meantime, they're talking a lot about disinformation. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=192.12s)]
*  I know Peter Doocy asked a fair question the other day and he was branded as being, you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=194.42s)]
*  know, the question was disinformation. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=199.98s)]
*  What is the question? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=202.66s)]
*  We just said, well, the way he said it, Mark, what is it in particular that people are saying [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=203.66s)]
*  that is so angry in the White House? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=210.45999999999998s)]
*  Because the New York Times has got something up right now about all these wild theories [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=212.38s)]
*  about the hurricanes. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=216.7s)]
*  The storms were engineered to clear the way for lithium mining. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=218.7s)]
*  They were sent to help Democrats in next month's election. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=222.74s)]
*  They were formed by weather controlling lasers. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  Any of that part of it? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=229.78s)]
*  I would imagine that is part of the discussion. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=231.58s)]
*  Obviously, social media is a whole new element when it comes to the disasters that we as [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=233.78s)]
*  Americans experience today. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=238.22s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=239.70000000000002s)]
*  Whether or not it's rumors that pop up on X or on Reddit or anything else. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  And then they kind of take off from there. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=244.22s)]
*  The former president was asked about this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=246.54000000000002s)]
*  I think it was in Laura Ingraham's town hall back in Butler the other day. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=248.38s)]
*  And he made it very clear. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  It just feels like the government's not doing enough to help the people that are going through [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=252.64s)]
*  so much right now. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=256.53999999999996s)]
*  And there's always been politics when it comes to disaster recovery. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=257.97999999999996s)]
*  Remember what happened with Sandy? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, you guys were probably all on that couch dealing with the disaster response from [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  Hurricane Sandy back in 2012. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  We all remember what happened after Katrina in 05. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=268.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=270.56s)]
*  So you would imagine that there's always been a politics element of disaster recovery. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=271.56s)]
*  But because this is playing out so close to the election, it's getting more attention. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  All right, Mark. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=278.76s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=280.03999999999996s)]
*  I'd say this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=281.06s)]
*  I think a lot of it is they want to show that Donald Trump's irresponsible as a leader and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=282.06s)]
*  throws out misinformation. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=285.74s)]
*  You don't want that guy as president because he throws out things that aren't true. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  That's why they're double and triple down on it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=290.8s)]
*  That's why they had their performative conference call where everyone talked about how great [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=292.48s)]
*  the other person was handling this catastrophe, in my view. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=296.34000000000003s)]
*  And they all had the windbreakers on and complimented each other. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=299.86s)]
*  And misinformation, as long as there's social media, which is for the rest of our lives, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=303.5s)]
*  there's always going to be things out there that make no sense. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=307.38s)]
*  And when Grande Santa said it, you just listen to us. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=310.1s)]
*  Don't worry about the other stuff. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=314.16s)]
*  Brian, they are following the bouncing ball as they always do. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  Sure, there is some misinformation about what's happened on the ground. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  But what's not misinformation is the way that they handled the storm. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=323.22s)]
*  The fact that the truth didn't get there in time enough. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=327.24s)]
*  The fact that there's still dead bodies there that they haven't been able to recover. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=330.22s)]
*  The fact that they didn't plan efficiently there on the ground. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=333.78000000000003s)]
*  The residents are upset about this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=336.54s)]
*  I find this much like in the community in Ohio, everybody started talking about the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=338.9s)]
*  cats and dogs story. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=343.11999999999995s)]
*  But they failed to realize the real issue in the community, which is the schools were [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=344.56s)]
*  overrun. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=348.29999999999995s)]
*  Services were taken from the community. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=349.29999999999995s)]
*  I agree with you, Lawrence. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEuEs7eL-0w&t=350.29999999999995s)]
