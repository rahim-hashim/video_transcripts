# Newt Gingrich mocks Dems' latest Trump insult: 'This is just nuts'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM)
*  So here we go, California Governor Gavin Newsom doing what liberals won't bringing Republicans on its podcast [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=0.0s)]
*  Is it a genuine attempt at bipartisanship or a training ground for 2028 debates? That's what our next guest asked him [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  2028 president Vance [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=16.2s)]
*  Probably runs against governor Newsom [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=19.96s)]
*  Vice president dance runs against president Vance [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=23.28s)]
*  Look at some of your other candidates [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=26.78s)]
*  I mean the governor of all due respect the governor of Illinois as a presidential candidate. Give me a break [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=28.38s)]
*  I'm not I'm not getting the middle of all this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=34.5s)]
*  Unbelievable, but I would not be at all shocked to have a news of Vance [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=37.62s)]
*  Well, we'll see Fox's contributor former speaker of the house new Gingrich joins us now he's got a brand new book out [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=44.22s)]
*  It's 44th called Trump's triumph. We're gonna get to his second you went on that you went on that podcast [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=49.58s)]
*  What are your thoughts going in? We were press who what you heard because the report card is not good for Gavin Newsom [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=55.38s)]
*  I've I've known Newsom for years [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  He wrote a brilliant book called citizenville back when he was mayor of San Francisco [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=62.580000000000005s)]
*  I mean his biggest problem is California. It's a total disaster [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  But it's also the biggest state. So if you're talking about Democratic primaries, he's formidable [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=73.98s)]
*  But I did it in part just for the heck of it [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=79.46000000000001s)]
*  He's a very smart very agile guy with a terrible record [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=81.42s)]
*  Right with a terrible record and he has a chance to correct in this last year and he's not doing any [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=85.94s)]
*  He can't change it. He can't take on Sacramento. Right? Well, you could say you could say that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=90.34s)]
*  I'm just gonna and didn't say I'm gonna enforce the border. I'm gonna crack down on illegal immigration [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=95.92s)]
*  I'm gonna keep women [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna keep men out of women's sports and then see where it goes [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=101.22s)]
*  He wouldn't he wouldn't get out of Sacramento alive if he did that stuff. So what? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=104.26s)]
*  But if he wants to go to Washington that's what we need [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=108.9s)]
*  Who do you think is who do you think is is formidable outside Newsom? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=111.74000000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris including the Washington Post weighs a run for governor some Democrats are moving on [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=116.62s)]
*  Do you think that she could be a legitimate governor? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=121.66000000000001s)]
*  Republican who can should do all they can to keep her propped up [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=125.98s)]
*  Because she's a disaster. She is I mean she she represents the Obama Biden tradition of left-wing incompetence [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=130.02s)]
*  So let's talk about your book triumph you start up close and personal you're a key advisors very few people in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=136.70000000000002s)]
*  Politics that he respects more than you. What did you see? I [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=142.3s)]
*  Saw enormous courage. I mean this this whole recent thing about Taka, you know Trump always caves [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=147.02s)]
*  It's just nuts. Here's a guy with it with the courage to run against 16 guys [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=153.62s)]
*  Here's a guy with the courage to endure the CIA and the FBI with the Russia hoax. He endures [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=158.74s)]
*  Two impeachment attempts for a rigged election two assassination attempts four efforts to put him in jail and his critics think that he [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=165.01999999999998s)]
*  Always caves [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=173.29999999999998s)]
*  My experience is he almost always wins. Yeah, it doesn't track. Let's just talk about this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=174.74s)]
*  Here's an excerpt from your book about we think best exemplifies the chapter message you try to put out [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=180.66s)]
*  Candidate Trump instinctively knew he had to have a great thing to communicate [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=186.62s)]
*  He concluded that it was to make America great again when as a marketing it translated into MAGA MAGA hats MAGA t-shirts MAGA bumper [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  Stickers MAGA signs suddenly a big idea was born [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=197.78s)]
*  Candidate Trump became the leader of a movement far bigger than himself. You saying it grew in he grew into this movement [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  Look the movement goes all the way back to Goldwater and people can still go to YouTube and see Reagan's time for choosing speech from October [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=209.9s)]
*  64 that movement has been growing ever since as people get disgusted with left-wing big government [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=217.68s)]
*  And Trump comes along the genius of Trump in part is he doesn't put out buttons that say Trump [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=224.12s)]
*  He doesn't put out hats that say Trump [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=231.04s)]
*  He he identifies with making America great again [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=233.44s)]
*  Which is probably as powerful a term as you can get in the American political system and the result is [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=238.04s)]
*  You know, he beat 16 Republicans in order [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=244.68s)]
*  Then he just beat a good field field again. Yes, Nikki Haley governor to Santa's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=248.32s)]
*  He'd be beat but he beat the second field without even looking showing up [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=252.52s)]
*  I mean by now by then he had become Trump. I mean, I know if we have close than I were at [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=256.04s)]
*  Luther College in Decor, Iowa [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=261.64s)]
*  She was being honored for a lifetime achievement. We're walking down Main Street. This is in [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=263.88s)]
*  2019 and there's a store. I'm sorry. It's in [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=268.56s)]
*  2023 there's a store. It's it's Trump. It's a local group. Yeah, not part of any campaign [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  spontaneous [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  Because Trump has now personified [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=280.56s)]
*  For at least half the country that he is the future [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=283.36s)]
*  He if we're gonna have a healthy safe prosperous America, it's gonna be with Donald Trump [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=287.24s)]
*  Do you realize that Joe Biden thought he'd make it a negative MAGA a negative MAGA Republicans and it just blew up in his face [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=293.4s)]
*  Now MAGA is embraced. He tried to make it a he tried to make it a scarlet letter at the risk of showing my age [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=300.28s)]
*  We did polling in 1983 getting ready for the Reagan re-elect [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=307.12s)]
*  The strongest term in American politics is America at about 93 or 94 percent [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=312.0s)]
*  The second strongest term that year was gunboat diplomacy [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=319.38s)]
*  Which was 1% weaker? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=323.46s)]
*  But was what people thought of as also as America [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=325.46s)]
*  So when you take when you take on America, and this is what the left is discovering, you know [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=328.34s)]
*  And AOC is out here hating America [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=333.02s)]
*  She's isolating herself from about 85 percent of the country [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=335.65999999999997s)]
*  And she doesn't realize that because she gets a big crowd in Idaho [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=339.38s)]
*  But you know what I love about this you take your perspective your knowledge of politics your love of history [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=343.06s)]
*  And your knowledge of the president historic figure and it all is in in your book Trump's triumph [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-XpNcIkLM&t=347.82s)]
