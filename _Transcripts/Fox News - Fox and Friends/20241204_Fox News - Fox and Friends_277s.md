# Democrats are starting to see the writing on the wall: Conway
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo)
*  Well, on to this, Democrat senators seemingly accepting their fate in the minority and readying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=0.0s)]
*  to work with Republicans. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Senator Welch from Vermont saying this, Trump won. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  He's the president. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=10.36s)]
*  We have to accept that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=11.36s)]
*  He has a right to nominate his cabinet members. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=12.88s)]
*  Our approach will be to give him the benefit of the doubt, but not a blank check. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Former White House counselor and host of Here's the Deal with Kellyanne on Fox Nation, Kellyanne [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=20.8s)]
*  Conway joins me now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  I think it's excellent and it's the growing trend because Senator Welch and others have [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=29.56s)]
*  obviously seen, Emily, President Trump move this country into a center-right direction. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=34.68s)]
*  We've gone from the Obama coalition 2012 to Trump country 2024. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=39.96s)]
*  The migration of Hispanic Americans, Black Americans, union households, Jewish Americans, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  women, you name it, going from, and of course, non-college educated households, going from [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=50.16s)]
*  Obama to Trump in the span of 12 years, has shown these senators, including those who [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  have been there quite a while, that this is a mandate from the country to a president [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=60.12s)]
*  elect who has been very specific and granular about his agenda, what he's going to do in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=64.72s)]
*  everyday affordability, border security, energy independence, these foreign engagements. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=69.39999999999999s)]
*  He has been, he's on Twitter and Truth Social daily telling us what he's going to do that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=74.36s)]
*  day. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  I think these senators are actually tired of the infighting in their party, in the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=80.76s)]
*  Democratic party, and also the lack of direction. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  I don't think any of them are going to miss out on a Kamala Harris presidency. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=88.04s)]
*  They probably weren't looking forward to that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=91.44s)]
*  And also, there are only two states in the whole country that did not go more red, Washington [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=93.68s)]
*  State and Nebraska. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=97.56s)]
*  So think of that too. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  Even if you're in a, quote, blue state, whatever that means these days, Donald Trump had the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=100.36000000000001s)]
*  had in those states. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=106.92s)]
*  Places like Minnesota, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Virginia, New Mexico, Kamala Harris, Illinois, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=107.92s)]
*  she barely won these states by a single digit. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  So they see the writing on the wall. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=116.56s)]
*  And I think the last thing to know is people like Peter Welch are hearing from their constituents. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=118.3s)]
*  Give Trump some grace and some latitude. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=123.0s)]
*  We want some real things done for this country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  And I want you, the Democrat, to start acting in a bipartisan fashion. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=127.54s)]
*  The polls say 59% of Americans support President Trump's transition, his cabinet picks, and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=131.44s)]
*  55% say they're happy and satisfied that he was elected president. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=136.72s)]
*  He never had numbers like that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=140.96s)]
*  So hopefully the Matt Welch approach will be represented by the majority of the minority [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=142.56s)]
*  of those House Democrats. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=147.96s)]
*  All right, I want to get your opinion on this, which is the fact that the Trump team, his [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=148.96s)]
*  defense team, has just moved to dismiss the case and in part citing the pardon of Hunter [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=152.4s)]
*  Biden, right? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=157.84s)]
*  Look, this isn't fair, but this also sets the tone. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  What say you about the motion to dismiss under color of that blanket pardon that the president [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=162.84s)]
*  said he wasn't going to do but did? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=168.24s)]
*  Joe Biden is taking so much heat from Democrats today. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  Emily, you're saying that he put family over country and it's really rich from the always [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  wrong never Trumpers and their stupid slogan of country over party and how ridiculous they [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=178.28s)]
*  look now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=183.52s)]
*  Fast forward, President Trump and his team have a right to say dismiss this politically [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  motivated case in the Southern District here, a case I should tell the viewers I testified [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=189.52s)]
*  in twice to the grand jury in that Stormy Daniels nonsense case. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=198.36s)]
*  Because I had been the campaign manager and they're claiming it's a campaign finance [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=199.36s)]
*  violation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=201.88s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=202.88s)]
*  We don't pay people. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=203.88s)]
*  That never crossed my desk. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=204.88s)]
*  And so he knows that that entire case, everybody watched it, and then he was elected president [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=206.24s)]
*  anyway. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=211.96s)]
*  People saw it and I think they saw Donald Trump being treated unfairly. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  Emily, in many ways this was a fairness election, fairness over wokeness. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=217.04s)]
*  People say it's not fair. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  It's actually outrageous to have puberty blockers, to have men and women's sports, to have plumbers [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=223.0s)]
*  and pipe fitters pay for student loans of doctors and lawyers, to have kids in failing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  schools. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=230.12s)]
*  It's not fair to them. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=231.12s)]
*  Give them school choice. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=232.12s)]
*  It's not fair to have 10 million migrants in this country illegally. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=233.12s)]
*  And for us to see in the streets of New York, they get cell phones and debit cards and cash [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=235.56s)]
*  and hotel rooms and your child's seat in New York City classroom. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=239.8s)]
*  So the other fairness is how Donald Trump has been treated in these legal cases. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=243.84s)]
*  And I hope that they win that motion. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=247.68s)]
*  You're right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=249.84s)]
*  We all see ourselves in how he's been treated because it could be us and it is us already. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=250.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=256.16s)]
*  Incredible insight. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=257.16s)]
*  Emily, congratulations on your book. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=258.16s)]
*  We're also excited for you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI6-pUVkPo&t=259.16s)]
