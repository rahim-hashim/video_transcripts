*  So after a political article reports that Trump told his inner circle and members of his cabinet that Musk will be stepping back [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=19.64s)]
*  saying quote the president is pleased with Elon Musk but the decision comes as the tech mogul increasingly looks like a political liability [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=26.68s)]
*  Well, the White House wasted no time in responding the press secretary posting this quote [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=33.68s)]
*  This scoop is garbage [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  Elon Musk and President Trump have both publicly stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=41.48s)]
*  Employee when his incredible work at Doge is complete to which must commented this quote. Yeah fake news [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=47.64s)]
*  Well, I think he's amazing but I also think he's got a big company to run and so at some point [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=56.4s)]
*  He's gonna be going back. I'd keep him as long as I could keep him. He's a very talented guy [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=61.56s)]
*  You know, I love very smart people and he's very smart and he's done a good job, you know, Doge [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  Doge is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=71.88s)]
*  We found [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  Numbers that nobody can even believe and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=76.48s)]
*  Musk has been the public face of Doge since the president signed an executive order [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=79.44s)]
*  Establishing the office in January, but it has always been anticipated [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=84.56s)]
*  Musk would step back when his [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=88.48s)]
*  130 days as a special government employee run out in May and so far the Doge website reports savings of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  140 billion dollars as of March 30th guys and must must telling our Brett Bayer last week [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=98.88s)]
*  He believes his team can't accomplish most of their goals within that 130 days [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=105.08s)]
*  Thanks, Chandley. Thank you, Chandley [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=110.68s)]
*  When are we gonna realize that there is no Trump insider he talks to us every day [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=112.2s)]
*  They there is you you could sit there and whisper and politicalize this big story [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=116.4s)]
*  He told Brett Bayer on Monday told him last week that aired on Friday. He said yep [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=120.84s)]
*  I'm about done when I'm done. We'll be out of here 130 days is right [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=125.36s)]
*  It makes total sense and yesterday people pointing to the fact that Wisconsin special election didn't come out [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=128.6s)]
*  Well, despite all the money and Tommy put in okay [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you've noticed it but Elon Musk isn't much of a quitter. So he doesn't go [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=137.56s)]
*  Okay, I lost I guess I'm not gonna be effective [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=141.76s)]
*  Luritree calibrates and keeps going and now he's what I think is gonna happen [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=144.0s)]
*  They're gonna start seeing more and more of the faces of Doge rather than just Elon Musk of Doge [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=148.2s)]
*  Politico also said he's gonna leave in the coming weeks. That's very vague [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=153.84s)]
*  I mean coming weeks he said I'll be here for 130 days. That's the coming week, right? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=158.16s)]
*  Well, here's the thing Donald Trump said apparently at a cabinet meeting last week that he's gonna leave soon. I [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=162.68s)]
*  Think what what is confusing a lot of people though is you know those stories after he started with the Doge [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  bulldozing of Washington was [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=176.68s)]
*  The stories were you know the predictions were he's here to stay and that Donald Trump will find a another way around that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=179.2s)]
*  130 day limit and remember when he was on with Larry Kudlow when Elon Musk was [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=186.48s)]
*  Kudlow said you think you're you're gonna go another year and he said yeah, I might go another year [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=193.2s)]
*  So there was always gonna have to be a workaround [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=197.72s)]
*  But now it sounds like he's probably gonna go ahead and go run as many businesses before the 130 days is up [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywp9tEYEwGo&t=200.16s)]
