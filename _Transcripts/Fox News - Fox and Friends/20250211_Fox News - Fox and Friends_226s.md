# Legal expert 'baffled' by courts blocking Trump, Musk DOGE efforts
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ)
*  So, Jonathan, I find these judges are going against efficiency. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't see a political agenda. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=5.26s)]
*  I see something the Democrats aren't calling for by a guy they don't really know and they're [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=7.04s)]
*  getting worried. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=11.8s)]
*  Let's take two of the freezes. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=12.96s)]
*  The federal employee buyout offer. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=14.74s)]
*  What do you think the chances of Trump getting his way there and letting this buyout go through [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=16.4s)]
*  for the $65,000 plus they're wanting? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  I think that Trump is on very solid ground with the buyout. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=25.52s)]
*  I'm still a bit baffled by what the court is doing here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  The presidents are allowed to dictate conditions of employees coming into the office, what [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  they're working on. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=38.36s)]
*  All of that is part of Article 2 powers of the president controlling the executive branch. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=39.8s)]
*  I'm not, even today, certain what the constitutional problem is. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=44.96s)]
*  You've got 65,000 employees who are told, look, we'll let you stay at home and look [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=49.64s)]
*  for a job as long as you agree to resign in a given number of months. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=54.16s)]
*  They've agreed to it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  The government's agreed to it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=59.68s)]
*  That seems to me to be perfectly within the wheelhouse of the president. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=61.4s)]
*  So I think he's going to win on that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  Doge's access to U.S. Treasury data. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=66.8s)]
*  So there's a lot of personal data on there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=68.84s)]
*  I saw that five former U.S. Treasury secretaries put together an editorial saying you should [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  not let those other people unelected who aren't Treasury secretaries in there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=75.72s)]
*  Where do you think that stands? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=80.88s)]
*  I've always suspected that this was always about Elon Musk trying to steal my identity [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=84.04s)]
*  because I'm the man he always wanted to be. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=88.48s)]
*  But I think that the problem is that Musk is not actually reviewing this material. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=92.16s)]
*  This is a read-only situation of people that he has selected. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=96.92s)]
*  It is very hard to deal with inefficiencies and waste unless you can actually see the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  receipts, actually see what's coming in and going out. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=107.88s)]
*  Now there are some legitimate issues here for the court to address. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  The privacy act, the data comes with special protections. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=114.56s)]
*  If you're going to introduce a new data system, there are protections for that too. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=118.16s)]
*  That would have been worthy of the court to say, look, I'm going to require you to satisfy [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=123.16s)]
*  those conditions. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=126.8s)]
*  But I think the court really got ahead of its skis here. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=128.48s)]
*  It went way too far in shutting down Treasury officials from looking at this material. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=131.0s)]
*  I think that ultimately that can't stand. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=137.4s)]
*  They may end up with something in the middle, but ultimately the President of the United [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=140.2s)]
*  States and his designated officials have to look at this material because that's what [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=144.32s)]
*  he does. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=149.68s)]
*  He runs the executive branch. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=150.68s)]
*  I think so. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=152.0s)]
*  How are we going to get our house in order if we don't know where the money's going? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=153.0s)]
*  USAID worker layoffs, I mean, they're moving ahead with this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  They took the name off the building. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=159.92s)]
*  They cut the lease. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  They told these people not to come to work. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=162.64s)]
*  So where does the judge says people will be hurt if this is stopped? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=164.76s)]
*  Therefore, we're in a pause? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=169.28s)]
*  Yeah, see, that's another problem with how these cases are constructed. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=170.84s)]
*  You know, Congress can make decisions. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=177.56s)]
*  They're the ones who buy ships, but it is the President that decides who's going to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=179.96s)]
*  take the ship out and the crew. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  He can reduce the number of crew members. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  And so there are different aspects of authority here. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=189.84s)]
*  And I think that the court is really intruding significantly in the President's authority. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=194.32000000000002s)]
*  He's allowed to downsize and they're allowed to do process. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=198.76s)]
*  They're allowed to employment protections, but they're not allowed to permanent employment. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=206.48s)]
*  It's going to ultimately end up in the State Department, which is how many employees are [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=207.84s)]
*  going to go over there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=211.44s)]
*  It looks like Jonathan Turley, exciting times. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=212.44s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJDS2iA02vQ&t=215.2s)]
