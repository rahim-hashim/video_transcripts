*  now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=24.12s)]
*  Great to see you, Charlie. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=25.12s)]
*  Are you surprised? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=26.6s)]
*  Are you surprised about this relationship between Trump and Dimon? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=27.76s)]
*  No, and excuse me for my voice. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=30.360000000000003s)]
*  Like you, I talk too much. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  But, you know, Will, here's the bottom line. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  You want a president that reaches out, particularly to smart people in the financial community. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=39.08s)]
*  This is what Trump does. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  He's really good at this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  He has kind of a kitchen cabinet of people in the business community he reaches out to, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  bounces ideas off of. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=51.72s)]
*  It's Donald Trump at his best. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=53.8s)]
*  Jamie Dimon is not necessarily a supporter. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=55.44s)]
*  I broke for Fox Business that he was thinking about joining the Kamala Harris administration [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=58.04s)]
*  and then backed off of that later on. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=64.48s)]
*  But he's nominally a Democrat, but he's smart. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=66.84s)]
*  And Trump and his people are reaching out to a lot of smart people on Wall Street to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=70.48s)]
*  give their views about what went wrong the last four years. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=76.56s)]
*  I mean, let's face it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=80.16s)]
*  We had massive inflation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=81.42s)]
*  We had increased regulations through the roof. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=82.76s)]
*  It depressed earnings of some companies, banks in particular, could have done a lot better. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  They could have helped the capital formation process better, infusing the free market system [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=92.68s)]
*  with more money. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=97.84s)]
*  But it was held back by banking regulations. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=99.02000000000001s)]
*  And I'm pretty sure that's exactly what Jamie Dimon is telling Trump's people right now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=101.72s)]
*  And I'm pretty sure regulations will be loosened on banks going forward. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=106.64s)]
*  At least, you know, we're going to have smart regulation. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=111.84s)]
*  We're not going to have no regulation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  But we're going to have smart regulation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=116.92s)]
*  And it's because Trump is listening to people like Dimon. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=118.72s)]
*  Well, Dimon's been praising Trump, Charlie, for quite some time. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=121.2s)]
*  I mean, almost a year ago now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=123.92s)]
*  Here's what he had to say about Donald Trump. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=127.88s)]
*  Take a step back. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=128.88s)]
*  Be honest. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=130.2s)]
*  He's kind of right about NATO, kind of right about immigration. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=131.2s)]
*  He grew the economy quite well. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=135.12s)]
*  Tax reform worked. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=136.72s)]
*  He was right about some of China. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=137.72s)]
*  So as you pointed out, that's coming from a guy who in the past, at least, has supported [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=139.98s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=143.38s)]
*  He's talking about what Donald Trump got right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=144.38s)]
*  I am curious from what you understand, Charlie, it's being described as a no holds barred [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  several types of sounding board meetings with Trump and his team. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=152.1s)]
*  I'm curious what no hold barred might mean. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  Well, that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=158.54s)]
*  I mean, Jamie Dimon is a famously, you know, shoot from the hip type guy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  And you know, if you know him, he doesn't mince words. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=166.14s)]
*  He's pretty tough. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=169.62s)]
*  I've known him for years. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=170.62s)]
*  We both met each other recently for a little reunion. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=171.62s)]
*  And I said, you know, we knew each other when neither of us had gray hair. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=174.9s)]
*  Now we both have a lot of gray hair. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=178.18s)]
*  But I'm just telling you, this is a guy that's kind of like Trump in that respect. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=180.3s)]
*  Again, he's warred with Trump. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=184.66000000000003s)]
*  He said he could be a better president with Trump, said he was tougher than Trump. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=186.78s)]
*  Trump shot back and said something equally, you know, gave him an elbow back. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=190.62s)]
*  But that's the way these guys are. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  And you know, that's what you want. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=198.01999999999998s)]
*  You want people that level with each other in these positions. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=199.5s)]
*  You don't want a Joe Biden who doesn't show up for the meeting. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=203.1s)]
*  You don't want Kamala Harris that gives you word salad where you really can't understand [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=207.85999999999999s)]
*  what she's saying. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=211.82s)]
*  You want people who tell you the truth about financial regulation, about the economy. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=212.82s)]
*  And I tell you, Jamie Dimon is one of those. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=218.14s)]
*  And that's why Trump appreciates them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=220.45999999999998s)]
*  Trust me on this. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=221.89999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=222.89999999999998s)]
*  Get some hot tea, man. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=223.89999999999998s)]
*  Take a day. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=224.89999999999998s)]
*  Take a day. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=225.89999999999998s)]
*  Don't watch college football. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=226.98s)]
*  Don't yell at your TV. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=228.5s)]
*  Just take a day. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=229.54s)]
*  It goes away when I work out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=230.54s)]
*  When I work out, I'm going to go running in a few minutes. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=231.54s)]
*  It will go away. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=234.73999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=235.73999999999998s)]
*  We'll look for you in Central Park. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=236.73999999999998s)]
*  Charlie Grass, thank you so much. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDvZozX40Uw&t=237.73999999999998s)]
