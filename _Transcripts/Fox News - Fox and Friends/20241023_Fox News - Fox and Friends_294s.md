# VP Harris fumbles answer, canâ€™t remember crucial swing state
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc)
*  All right, this morning, the Harris campaign reportedly worried about winning those blue [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=0.0s)]
*  wall states as the vice president stumbles to even remember one of them. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=7.22s)]
*  My plans will strengthen America's economy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=12.92s)]
*  His plans will weaken America's economy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  Then why do you think that's not landing with voters? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Because the numbers, it's the opposite. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=19.16s)]
*  Former President Trump leads you on this issue. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=21.16s)]
*  Well, when I'm out, this is why I'm going out to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and, and, and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=22.92s)]
*  Michigan, Michigan, excuse me. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=29.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  You got to remember Michigan, Trump, surrogate, North Dakota governor Doug Bergham joins us [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=32.440000000000005s)]
*  now governor. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=36.52s)]
*  She feared the blue walls beginning to crack is one of the headlines. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=37.84s)]
*  Do you see that feel that when you were out there and when you're out there for a former [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  president Trump? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=46.24s)]
*  Well, absolutely. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=47.88s)]
*  The, the enthusiasm is super high in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and the crowds are [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=49.2s)]
*  large and people are really coming out for President Trump. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=56.28s)]
*  Doesn't matter whether it's college kids before Michigan state game or whether it's retirees [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=59.92s)]
*  or energy workers in Pennsylvania, auto workers in Wisconsin. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=65.68s)]
*  And Kamala may not, she may not remember Michigan, but people in Michigan are going to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=70.2s)]
*  remember her EV mandates that are killing auto jobs in that state. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=75.72s)]
*  Right. Even though she says I'll go along with the law and she wants to bring manufacturing [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=80.04s)]
*  back, it doesn't seem to be resonating. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=84.56s)]
*  Real quick, before we move on to Iran, in terms of American production, oil and gas, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  she's for fracking. Then they said, I'm not going to look for any more fossil fuel [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  exploration. Then she walked up and says, I do. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=95.4s)]
*  These are all through surrogates. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=98.16s)]
*  What should people read into? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=99.84s)]
*  And you as a governor, when they come back and say, well, oil and gas did pick up under [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=101.2s)]
*  me, meaning the Biden Harris. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=109.76s)]
*  Well, that statement is completely misleading because they've done everything to attack [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=111.68s)]
*  U.S. energy during the Harris time in office. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=119.28s)]
*  And so any numbers that the U.S. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=122.84s)]
*  is producing right now is in spite of Harris, not because of her. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=125.0s)]
*  And when you take a look at what's going on in the world, I mean, they've been attacking [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=129.56s)]
*  U.S. energy and then allowing our adversaries, Russia, Iran, others, Venezuela, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=134.28s)]
*  to produce record amounts of energy overseas. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=141.44s)]
*  And so they're not only hurting the American economy, hurting American workers, they're [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=144.24s)]
*  actually helping fund wars abroad. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=149.16s)]
*  I mean, they're helping fund Iran's terrorism and they're helping fund Russia's war [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=152.0s)]
*  against Ukraine. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=156.16s)]
*  Yeah. And by the way, that led to the NBC News headline, Democrats Brace for a Possible [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=157.28s)]
*  Crack in the Blue Wall as signs of North Carolina is slipping. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=161.32s)]
*  That came out on Tuesday. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=164.68s)]
*  Now, Governor Bergam, you said, and there's a headline. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=167.0s)]
*  You said that Iran is funding terrorism around the world thanks to us looking the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=169.24s)]
*  other way when it comes to enforcing the sanctions. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=174.52s)]
*  They're selling their oil and gas to China and we're doing nothing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=177.24s)]
*  But how are we paying the price for that? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=181.4s)]
*  Well, first of all, just the scale of what Iran is doing and what the Biden Harris is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=184.52s)]
*  allowing here, I mean, not only the, you know, the 16 billion dollars of direct sanction [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=189.08s)]
*  relief that's given them more cash. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=193.56s)]
*  You know, President Trump had Iran financially on their knees relative to the sanctions [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  actually working. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=202.52s)]
*  And under Biden Harris, they've quadrupled the amount of of annual oil production, as [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=204.0s)]
*  you say, going to China. China's increasing their strategic petroleum reserve, getting [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=209.12s)]
*  ready for World War Three. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  Harris and Biden drained our petroleum reserve in half ahead of the midterms. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=215.12s)]
*  With your knowledge of the energy industry, if Israel is going to hit Iran, we know [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=218.96s)]
*  that. If they do decide to take out their oil and gas production, what would that do [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=223.76s)]
*  to the price of oil and gas in the world? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=229.12s)]
*  Well, there might be a spike at some point in time. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=232.12s)]
*  But right now, there's a lot of capacity, potential increase for other players to step [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  in and fill that gap. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  When price goes up, people increase their supply. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  But, you know, you could take care of all of that if you were actually supporting the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=245.32s)]
*  U.S. shale industry, because between Oklahoma, Texas, Alaska, North Dakota and Pennsylvania, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=249.64s)]
*  we could take all that slack up in the United States. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=254.88s)]
*  So but I know that they're afraid of doing anything that might raise the price at the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=257.32s)]
*  pump ahead of the midterms. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=260.92s)]
*  And that's why they keep allowing our adversaries. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=262.44s)]
*  That's why they're you know, that's why they're allowing record amounts of Venezuelan oil [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=264.76s)]
*  into our country. They're doing anything they can to manipulate the price. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=268.52s)]
*  And they're doing that. That's harming American consumers. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=272.28s)]
*  And it's and it's helping our adversaries. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=274.68s)]
*  Right. And it helps brutal dictators like the Venezuelan leader. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=276.88s)]
*  Governor Burgum, thanks so much. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TO2meTnNc&t=280.12s)]
