# Michael Oren: The people of Israel have had enough
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg)
*  Fox News right now a live look, a live look at smoke rising from a field in southern Lebanon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=0.0s)]
*  as fighting between Israel and Hezbollah intensifies. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=7.0s)]
*  Overnight the IDF intercepting rockets and striking terror targets in the United States. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=10.0s)]
*  Look at the secondary explosions by the way. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=14.0s)]
*  The United States is deploying even more troops to the Middle East to the tune of about 40,000. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=16.0s)]
*  Nate Foy is live in Tel Aviv. Nate. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=21.0s)]
*  Hey Brian, good morning. So Israel and Hezbollah again trading fire today as we are learning [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=25.0s)]
*  devastating new numbers from Lebanon's health ministry. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=30.0s)]
*  At least 558 people were killed and over 1800 others injured as a result of yesterday's airstrikes in Lebanon. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=33.0s)]
*  And they're continuing this morning not only in southern Lebanon but northeast of Beirut in the Beka Valley. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=42.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Hezbollah continues firing on Israel with 55 additional rockets being fired this morning, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=48.0s)]
*  leading many in northern Israel to wake up to this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=54.0s)]
*  So Brian, this is after Hezbollah fired 250 rockets yesterday. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=66.0s)]
*  The IDF hasn't reported any serious injuries as a result of those attacks. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=71.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, overnight, take a look at this. Israel continued targeting Hezbollah weapons facilities. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=75.0s)]
*  They hit 1600 terrorist sites yesterday. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=80.0s)]
*  Israel continues chipping away at the estimated 150,000 rockets, missiles and drones that Hezbollah had accumulated before the war. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=83.0s)]
*  The human cost to achieving that though was severe yesterday and continues to be today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=92.0s)]
*  Yesterday was the deadliest day in Lebanon since the second Lebanon war in 2006. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=98.0s)]
*  Of those killed, there were at least 35 children and 58 women. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=103.0s)]
*  Today Israel is again telling the people of Lebanon to get out of harm's way. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=107.0s)]
*  I have a message for the people of Lebanon. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=113.0s)]
*  Israel's war is not with you. It's with Hezbollah. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=116.0s)]
*  For too long, Hezbollah has been using you as human shields. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=120.0s)]
*  Israel's Iron Dome intercepted the majority of the 250 Hezbollah rocket attacks yesterday. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=125.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the U.S. is sending more support to the region. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=132.0s)]
*  The Pentagon didn't provide specifics, but they will assist the 40,000 troops already in the region. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=135.0s)]
*  And this has the USS Truman may join the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier already in the region. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=141.0s)]
*  Also today, Iran's president will formally address the UN in New York after accusing Israel yesterday [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=147.0s)]
*  of seeking a wider conflict. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=153.0s)]
*  This as IDF Chief of Staff Herzei Halevi said that Israel is preparing for the next phases [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=156.0s)]
*  of whatever comes on the northern border. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=162.0s)]
*  We'll send it back to you, Brian. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=164.0s)]
*  Thanks so much, Nate. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=166.0s)]
*  Let's expand on what Nate just reported on this ongoing conflict in the north [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=167.0s)]
*  with former Israeli ambassador to the United States, a good friend of the show, Ambassador Michael Orrin. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=171.0s)]
*  Ambassador, first off, clearly the prime minister thinks [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=177.0s)]
*  in order to address this problem with Hezbollah, they have to escalate to the point where their attention, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=180.0s)]
*  where Israel's gotten their attention. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=186.0s)]
*  What has changed since the pager attack, since the ongoing rocket attacks and the targeting of their upper echelon? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=188.0s)]
*  Well, good morning, Brian. It's always good to be with you. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=197.0s)]
*  What's changed is the people of Israel have simply had enough. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=200.0s)]
*  For more than 11 months now, the northern part of Israel, the Galilee, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=203.0s)]
*  an area that's precious to a great many Americans, not just to Israelis, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=208.0s)]
*  has been under relentless, relentless rocket and drone fire from Hezbollah. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=211.0s)]
*  There's been 100,000 Israelis who have been rendered homeless, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=215.0s)]
*  thousands of houses destroyed, dozens of people killed and wounded. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=218.0s)]
*  And by the way, 70,000 acres of farmland set afire by this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=222.0s)]
*  No country would put up for this for much longer, and certainly Israelis haven't had enough. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=226.0s)]
*  My own family is sitting under bomb shelters. My family lives in Galilee. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=231.0s)]
*  It is enough and enough, and we want to change the game. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=234.0s)]
*  There was an administration official unnamed, quoted in the Israeli press today, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=237.0s)]
*  saying he could not remember a time in history where escalating led to de-escalation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=241.0s)]
*  You have to de-escalate in order to escalate. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=246.0s)]
*  Well, we strongly, strongly disagree. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=248.0s)]
*  In fact, throughout history, the greatest example is that if you want to de-escalate, you have to escalate. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=251.0s)]
*  That's how America won World War II. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=255.0s)]
*  We have to escalate against Hezbollah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=258.0s)]
*  We have to let Hezbollah know, and know in certain terms, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=260.0s)]
*  that if you're going to try to shell and displace and kill Israelis, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=264.0s)]
*  you're going to pay a very, very painful price. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=267.0s)]
*  And I think it's important to point out, Ryan, they give these statistics about 550 people killed in Lebanon. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=270.0s)]
*  Of course, any civilian death is a tragedy, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=274.0s)]
*  but that number does not distinguish how many of the 550 were actually Hezbollah terrorists. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=277.0s)]
*  And these are terrorists who are using these civilians as a human shield. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=282.0s)]
*  They're putting missiles in their houses. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=285.0s)]
*  If we have to blow up the houses, who are responsible for the deaths? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=287.0s)]
*  Israel or Hezbollah? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=290.0s)]
*  So people know about October 7th, but they don't know about October 8th. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=292.0s)]
*  Unprovoked attack October 7th. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=295.0s)]
*  On the 8th is when the rockets started from Hezbollah, unprovoked, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=297.0s)]
*  forcing 80,000 people minimum from their homes, living in hotels. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=301.0s)]
*  That status quo can't remain. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=305.0s)]
*  So I want to bring you to the Wall Street Journal story from Walter Russell Meade today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=308.0s)]
*  And it's an editorial talking about the track record of the Biden administration. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=313.0s)]
*  And it's really hard to argue, quote, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=316.0s)]
*  no administration in American history has been as committed to Middle East diplomacy as this one, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=319.0s)]
*  yet an administration diplomatic, yet have an administration's diplomats ever had less success. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=324.0s)]
*  Think about their decisions, the decisions not to pursue the Abraham Accords, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=331.0s)]
*  decisions to take the Houthis off the terrorist list, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=335.0s)]
*  the decisions to call Saudi Arabia a pariah nation and re-approach relations with Iran. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=338.0s)]
*  All their moves resulted in this, I would argue, and he argues. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=345.0s)]
*  How about you? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=349.0s)]
*  Well, I have nothing but the highest regard for Walter Russell Meade. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=351.0s)]
*  He's a great personal friend. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=353.0s)]
*  And I have a historical perspective. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=355.0s)]
*  It's going back not just to this administration, but through many years now. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=356.0s)]
*  The United States has tried to effect a diplomatic solution in Syria, in Libya, in Egypt, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=360.0s)]
*  in Jordan, in Yemen. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=366.0s)]
*  There's a long, long list of failures here. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=369.0s)]
*  No one seems to internalize that the only way to truly make an impact in the Middle East is by projecting power. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=372.0s)]
*  And to this date, for example, almost 100 percent of the violence now sweeping across the United States is the fault of Iran. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=378.0s)]
*  And the United States has never fired a single bullet at Iran, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=385.0s)]
*  not since a previous president took out the most senior, most military leader in Iran, was Qasem Soleimani. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=388.0s)]
*  Iran never gets to pay a price. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=396.0s)]
*  And if Iran's not going to pay a price, of course it's going to continue. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=398.0s)]
*  You're stabilized. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=401.0s)]
*  And just to finish up, and it's hard to argue, as America withdraws or attempts to withdraw from the regions, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=402.0s)]
*  its influence over the relevant parties diminishes. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=409.0s)]
*  The less reliable America looks, the less value anyone attaches to promises of American support, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=411.0s)]
*  the more obviously America looks towards the exits, the less anyone fears America power. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=417.0s)]
*  It doesn't work to our advantage. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=422.0s)]
*  That's not what road do you want to take. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=424.0s)]
*  There's a road of weakness and capitulation where our allies are left alone, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=427.0s)]
*  and one that shows strength that protects our allies and our trade. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=431.0s)]
*  It's not just Israel understands this. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=437.0s)]
*  We actually managed to sign peace with Jordan and Egypt because we defeated them successively in war time after time. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=440.0s)]
*  We have peace with the Abrahamic court countries because we're strong. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=446.0s)]
*  They didn't sign those peace accords because they love us. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=449.0s)]
*  They signed us because we're standing up to their two major threats, Sunni extremism and Shiite extremism. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=451.0s)]
*  We're the only country in the region doing this, and they want to make peace with us. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=457.0s)]
*  You want peace in the Middle East, then be ready for war. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=460.0s)]
*  I know this sounds terrible for John Lennon, but you've got to give war a chance if you want to get peace. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=463.0s)]
*  Well, giving peace a chance takes two parties. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=469.0s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you so much. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=471.0s)]
*  And they know you're not a threat. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=473.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=474.0s)]
*  That's another reason why the Abrahamic courts works. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdvq478gTZg&t=475.0s)]
