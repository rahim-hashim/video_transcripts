# 'Radical' judge angers Homan with shocking comparison, gets fiery response
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg)
*  The police commissioner of Boston. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=0.0s)]
*  You said you doubled down on not helping the law enforcement offers a voice. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  I'm coming to Boston. I'm bringing hell with me. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=12.48s)]
*  It's a promise made promise kept a month after that promise borders our time home [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=15.08s)]
*  and announced a multi-agency operation in Boston that arrested nearly 400 illegal [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=18.96s)]
*  immigrants. A majority of them criminal migrants. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=23.76s)]
*  This as a local news investigation revealed that multiple legals were [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=26.919999999999998s)]
*  rounded up by ice were charged with. And you just look at it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  You got three counts of child rape. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=34.56s)]
*  You got aggravated child rape of a victim under the age of nine. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=36.5s)]
*  Then you look right here, assault to rape and a mass armed robbery. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=41.06s)]
*  This person was released on zero bill. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  Then you got two illegal aliens charged with child rape. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=48.44s)]
*  They released $500 each. And then finally, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=51.84s)]
*  two illegal aliens charged with cocaine and fitting all trafficking released on [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  $504,000 when it comes to the bill. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=59.959999999999994s)]
*  Let's bring in the big man himself. Borders are Tom Holman. Tom, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=63.8s)]
*  tell me exactly what's happening on the ground. How are you able to accomplish [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=67.88s)]
*  this? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=71.64s)]
*  Well, look, we're keeping president president Trump's promise. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=73.88s)]
*  President Trump has promised we're going to secure the border, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=76.1s)]
*  which we've done to a large extent. We're still working on it, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=78.25999999999999s)]
*  but we're at 96% decline on the border. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=81.32s)]
*  And he promised we're going to prioritize public safety threats and national [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=83.84s)]
*  security threats. It will go aliens in this country. And that's what we're doing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=87.56s)]
*  So Boston, I said at CPAC, they're sanctuary state, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=91.4s)]
*  and we're going to come and despite their sanctuary status, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=94.92s)]
*  we're going to bring agents here and we're going to take these worst of the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=97.52s)]
*  worst off the streets. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=99.8s)]
*  So Tom, just to get into some of the specifics here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  So you got these folks that had already been charged with this, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=103.94s)]
*  which are agents were asking, keep these guys behind bars, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=107.2s)]
*  and we'll go pick them up. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  But many of these criminals got charged and they were released back on the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=112.2s)]
*  street, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=116.84s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely right. In one case I looked at Lawrence, one case, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=119.36s)]
*  there's a child rape. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  He was released two years ago without honoring our detainer. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  It took us two years to find this person. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=128.2s)]
*  So how many children did he attack in the last two years? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=130.24s)]
*  All we're asking for is let our agents in the jail where you lock somebody up [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=133.72s)]
*  and let us arrest them there when you're done with them, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=138.48s)]
*  rather than releasing back in the public and making a public safety issue out of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=144.16s)]
*  Tom, now that you have these guys in custody, where are they going? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=145.0s)]
*  They're going to be deported. They're in detention now, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  and we'll deport each and every one of them. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=153.76s)]
*  We're going to stand by the president's promise to decrease illegal alien crime [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=155.72s)]
*  in this country. We're not going to arrest till every illegal alien public safety [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  threat, every illegal alien national security threat is eradicated from this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=162.64s)]
*  country. That is what we're doing. We're going to get it done. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=167.04s)]
*  This is what the governor of Massachusetts had said. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=170.12s)]
*  Governor Healy said this, Massachusetts is not a sanctuary state and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=172.48s)]
*  Massachusetts law enforcement regularly partnered with the federal agencies and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  federal law enforcement to keep people safe. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=179.6s)]
*  We are ranked as one of the safest states in the country. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  So Tom, is it a sanctuary state or not? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it is. And we just proved them wrong. The mayor, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  the mayor of Boston said I was lying on the road that I was lying about her city. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, we went to that city. We went to the surrounding counties around that city. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=197.56s)]
*  And you look what we did in five days. We got a lot of work to do. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  We're not done. We're going back. And I said, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=204.48s)]
*  we're going to keep going back until every illegal alien public safety threats [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=206.88s)]
*  removed, not from Massachusetts, from the country. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=210.28s)]
*  We're going to make this country safer. President Trump made a promise, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=213.39999999999998s)]
*  and we're going to keep president Trump's promise. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=216.56s)]
*  Tom, there's been some pushback about the flights going overseas. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=218.92s)]
*  Will the flights continue? Will these people go back? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=223.32s)]
*  Well, the alien enemies act, we're going to let that play out in court. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  And I'm not an attorney, but DOJ is taking that out in court. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=231.92s)]
*  But in the meantime, I've said, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=234.56s)]
*  we're not going to stop arresting men's and women's and TDA members in this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=236.16s)]
*  country. And if we can't remove them through tidal weight, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=239.0s)]
*  then we're going to detain them until this case is over. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=242.04s)]
*  But we're going to arrest them. We're going to take them off the streets. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=243.68s)]
*  We're going to keep our promise. TDA has been [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=246.12s)]
*  verified as terrorist organizations. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=248.44s)]
*  Them and MS-13, they're designated terrorist organizations. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=252.4s)]
*  Those two flights carry terrorists out of this country. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=255.64s)]
*  We're not going to apologize for it. We think we did the right thing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=258.48s)]
*  We follow the aliens enemies act. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=260.92s)]
*  The president simply invoked the authorities he has and a statue of federal law. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=262.8s)]
*  And that's what we did. This administration is following the law. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=268.08s)]
*  We're using the law to make this country safer. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=270.6s)]
*  Unlike the last administration, who not only ignored the law, Lawrence, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=272.76s)]
*  they violated law with misuse of parole. We're making this country safe again. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=276.88s)]
*  One illegal alien at a time. We're going to keep doing it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=280.64s)]
*  Tom, I know you've been doing this job over 30 years amongst Democrats and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=283.2s)]
*  Republican presidents. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=287.12s)]
*  There was a judge that talked about the treatment and they said something. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  I think you're going to take great umbrage with this is what the judge said. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=292.88s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=296.36s)]
*  The point here was that there were plain loads of people. I mean, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=297.76s)]
*  it was all sets of class action. There were plain loads of people. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=301.76s)]
*  There were no procedures in place to notify people. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=305.88s)]
*  Nazis got better treatment under the alien enemy act and has happened here. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=310.76s)]
*  Is that true, Tom? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=316.32s)]
*  No, we follow every procedure within an alien's enemy act. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=319.0s)]
*  Maybe she needs to read that act. We did the right thing. I've, I've been, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=322.0s)]
*  I'm not aware of every single case, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=327.04s)]
*  but I've been told by highest levels in ICE that every one of those, uh, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=328.68s)]
*  Wenzel Waylands outplaying was TDA based on hours of investigations, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=332.68s)]
*  uh, anywhere from criminal investigations to wiretaps to witnesses statement. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=338.12s)]
*  They put a lot of effort in this and I've been guaranteed that every one of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=342.12s)]
*  those Wenzel Waylands are a member of TDA. And again, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=345.72s)]
*  they're a designated terrorist organization and I'm sick of these radical judges. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=348.32000000000005s)]
*  Why don't they talk to, why don't they talk to Lake and Riley's family? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=352.36s)]
*  Who do processes she had. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=356.12s)]
*  Talk to the other young women that raped and murdered in this country by TDA [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  members. You know, talk to the family, young, uh, young lady that was burned alive on a subway. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=360.8s)]
*  We did the right thing. We're keeping president Trump's promise. We're going to, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=365.88s)]
*  we're going to arrest every one of these people. And again, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=369.08s)]
*  we're not going to arrest every one of them is on this country. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=371.24s)]
*  This is what the president Trump promised American people. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=374.16s)]
*  We're going to do this every day 24 seven across this country without apology. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=376.92s)]
*  We're going to keep doing what we're doing. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=380.88s)]
*  Tom, I only got a few seconds left, but before I go, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=382.52s)]
*  I just want you to make it clear to our audience why you guys don't release all [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=384.84000000000003s)]

*  Good morning guys. And late yesterday, here's what happened. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=455.64s)]
*  Attorney general Pam Bondi signed a document formally announcing the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=458.44s)]
*  administration is invoking the state secrets privilege to prevent the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=461.52s)]
*  government from having to disclose national security information in open court [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=464.96s)]

*  Christine Noem were made to Bondi, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=473.32s)]
*  but district judge James Boasberg wants answers about these flights to El [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=475.71999999999997s)]
*  Salvador after rejecting a request to lift a temporary block on those [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=479.68s)]
*  deportations under the alien enemies act. He wrote this because the named plaintiffs [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=483.96s)]
*  dispute that they are members of trend day or Agua, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=488.76s)]
*  they may not be deported until a court has been able to decide the merits of [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=491.24s)]
*  their challenge. Now at issue is whether judge Boasberg overstepped his [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=495.6s)]
*  authority when ordering the government to return more than 250 suspected TDA [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=499.68s)]

*  panel will make that determination and they appeared split on whether the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=514.16s)]
*  flights should continue with Obama appointed judge Patricia Millett blasting [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=518.08s)]
*  the use of the wartime authority. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=523.46s)]
*  Right here was that there were plane loads of people. I mean, it was also it's [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=526.24s)]
*  a class action. There were plane loads of people. There were no procedures in [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=530.96s)]
*  place to notify people. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=536.16s)]
*  Nazis got better treatment under the alien enemy act and has happened here. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=539.34s)]
*  But Judge Justin Walker, a trump appointee, seemed more empathetic to the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=544.24s)]
*  D. O. J.'s arguments in his questioning while that third judge appointed by [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=548.28s)]
*  President George H. W. Bush, Karen Henderson, asked no questions. We [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=552.16s)]
*  really aren't sure guys where she'll come down. They can rule any time and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=556.24s)]
*  they could rule narrowly or more broadly. We just have to wait and find [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=561.04s)]
*  out. And don't forget the losing side could also try and fast track this to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=565.0799999999999s)]
*  the Supreme Court guys. Right. Certainly will. Yeah, it's almost a given. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=569.3199999999999s)]
*  Whoever loses, although you know who is his grip? Is it true that they've [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=573.8399999999999s)]
*  already picked the Supreme Court justice that would hear it? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=577.68s)]
*  And it's Elena Kagan. We do not know that there's some speculation and look, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=580.76s)]
*  we also don't know, Brian, really, whether we could get a one sentence [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=585.8s)]
*  order today or whether or not we will get in coming days, a much broader [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=589.76s)]
*  ruling that will instruct perhaps future judges hearing cases like this in [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=595.7199999999999s)]
*  these circumstances. So a lot of unknowns right now could be broad, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  could be narrow. Griff, thank you. You know, I must say Judge Mallett, I don't [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=605.88s)]
*  think we've expressed appropriate level of rage for what she said. Yes, you are [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=610.44s)]
*  entitled to a hearing unless it's the alien enemies act where it's special [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=613.88s)]
*  wartime powers that mean the alien does not get a hearing. But Nazis got better [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=617.2s)]
*  treatment. Okay, that was despicable. Holman said Lake and Riley didn't get [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=622.96s)]
*  due process. Rachel Moran, a mother of four, did not get a modicum of due [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=628.24s)]
*  process when she was slaughtered out for a run, nor did Nungari, that little [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=633.44s)]
*  girl who went to a convenience store. So when the judge talks about Nazis and [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=638.36s)]
*  TDA, I can tell you the average American hears the young girls and mothers who [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=642.12s)]
*  have lost their lives who didn't get any due process. Well, right. And to that [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=647.1600000000001s)]
*  point, Kayleigh, they're still in the country right now. I take you to this [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=651.2800000000001s)]
*  operation that Tom Holman just did in Boston. Look at the, just look at the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=655.0400000000001s)]
*  wall right here. You got three counts of aggravated rape against a child right [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=659.88s)]
*  here, a victim under nine, assault rape, a mass armed robbery, child rape again, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=664.8s)]
*  by the way, release on bail for $500. You got cocaine and fentanyl [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=670.4399999999999s)]
*  trafficking across the country. This is just one city in the country that has a [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=675.24s)]
*  mayor that wants to defend them. The governor claims that it's not a sanctuary [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=681.0s)]
*  city. I'm sorry, a sanctuary state. But obviously these people found a sanctuary [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=685.72s)]
*  there. And one of the things that the administration has done is they're [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=690.4s)]
*  trying to figure out, okay, how can we get the people out of the country as [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=694.76s)]
*  quickly as possible? And we had heard that from Tom Holman from the get go, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=697.5600000000001s)]
*  even before he assumed the position. And so they're using this enemies and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=700.52s)]
*  aliens act from the 1700s to try to do it. They knew from my sources in the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=706.32s)]
*  administration, they knew it was going to get adjudicated. It was going to go [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=712.48s)]
*  through the courts. They just want finality. They want the American [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=715.12s)]
*  judicial system to say, okay, you can do it this way or you can do it that way. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=720.08s)]
*  And then they're going to do it that way, whatever it is, in a big way. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=724.36s)]
*  So yesterday over the weekend they just wanted to stress how Donald Trump is [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=728.76s)]
*  threatening to ignore the courts, which he has never done. That's true. Every single [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=731.88s)]
*  Sunday show focused on that except for Shannon's. Meanwhile, Donald Trump's [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=735.28s)]
*  borders are. Tom Holman in action big time in Boston, announced the rest of [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=740.32s)]
*  370 in the surrounding areas. He said on actually traveled to Boston on Tuesday [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=745.0799999999999s)]
*  as promised, kicking off a five day operation. It was pointed out by the [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=751.64s)]
*  governor pleased to work with ice. We're not a sanctuary state. We are. They we [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=755.68s)]
*  have sanctuary cities in our state. Here's Tom Holman. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=760.68s)]
*  One case is a child rape. He was released two years ago without honor. Our [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=765.64s)]
*  detainer. It took us two years to find this person. So how many Children did he [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=771.24s)]
*  attack the last two years? All we're asking for is let our agents in the jail. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=775.76s)]
*  Will you lock somebody up and let us arrest him there when you're done with [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=780.08s)]
*  him rather than really some back in the public and making a public safety issue [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=783.72s)]
*  out of it. Mary Woo in Boston said I was lying on the road that I was lying [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=787.44s)]
*  about her city. Well, we went to that city. We went to the surrounding [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=790.72s)]
*  counties around that city and you look what we did in five days. We got a lot [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=793.88s)]
*  of work to do. We're not done. We're going back. And I said, we're gonna keep [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=797.98s)]
*  going back until every illegal alien public safety threats removed now from [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=801.34s)]
*  Massachusetts from the country. We're gonna make this country safer. President [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=805.4599999999999s)]
*  Trump made a promise and we're gonna keep President Trump's promise. You know, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=809.18s)]
*  and one of the things that ice and Tom Holman is doing is the fact that when [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=812.8199999999999s)]
*  they sweep up 370 criminals, alien criminals and the people of [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=817.74s)]
*  Massachusetts, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts say why exactly doesn't [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=821.6999999999999s)]
*  our state or why doesn't our city cooperate with ice to get these people [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=825.94s)]
*  off the streets? Why don't they do that? The people, you know, they don't have a [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=830.9200000000001s)]
*  good answer. Yeah, you know, Tom Holman, if you look at the data Bill [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=834.5s)]
*  Mollusian put out, I just did some like rough calculator math of the 33,000 [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=837.86s)]
*  that they've apprehended illegal immigrants and you look at those who [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=841.6600000000001s)]
*  have pending criminal charges or convicted of crimes, 73.4% of people [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=844.9000000000001s)]
*  Tom Holman has wrapped up around the country have pending criminal charges [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=849.9000000000001s)]
*  or criminal convictions. That is pretty good. If you notice now the administration with that [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=854.4200000000001s)]
*  bus, you didn't see the names of them because there's too much coordination [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=858.5s)]
*  been going on. You release the names, you get all the information out there, the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=861.7s)]
*  criminals are on to you. So now the administration, they tried to be [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=865.38s)]
*  transparent, the leaks were happening all over the place and they're [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=868.54s)]
*  coordinating with the criminals. So now they're holding it and today wrap up [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=871.86s)]
*  everybody and then maybe we'll start hearing some. I just want our community [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=876.1800000000001s)]
*  to be safe. Yeah, I just said that President Trump, the Massachusetts State Police [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3XM6T_lodg&t=879.3000000000001s)]
