# Pelosi blasted over Bill Maher interview: 'She's lying!'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli Defense Force troops have located and recovered the bodies of six hostages found [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=3.2600000000000002s)]
*  in Gaza just days ago. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=7.98s)]
*  That includes American Hirsch Goldberg Pollan. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=10.44s)]
*  According to an IDF spokesman, the hostages were found, quote, brutally murdered, possibly [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=13.74s)]
*  a day or two before IDF troops found them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=18.54s)]
*  Hamas abducted all six innocent civilians on October 7th. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=22.54s)]
*  Meanwhile, here in the U.S., students already on high alert as protesters, pro-Hamas protesters, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=28.46s)]
*  vow to continue raging across campus. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=34.26s)]
*  A new report revealing Jewish Columbia students were chased from dorms, spat on, and pinned [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=36.74s)]
*  against walls, including one we spoke to earlier. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=42.68s)]
*  Since these demonstrators or protesters who violently sieged a building faced little to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=46.42s)]
*  no consequence, I'm concerned that this year we'll see an escalation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=51.88s)]
*  As I understand it, the group chats I'm in, the people I've been talking to have been [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=55.78s)]
*  saying, yeah, it's already starting again. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=59.02s)]
*  It's already starting back. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  They're already there at the gates. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  They're already protesting, demonstrating, chanting, everything. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  Fox News contributor and former history and social studies teacher Leo Terrell joins us [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=66.58s)]
*  now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=71.02s)]
*  Leo, to his point, do you think there hasn't been real accountability for the perpetrators [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=72.02000000000001s)]
*  who are harassing Jewish students. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=77.68s)]
*  Why should we expect anything to change on these universities? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=79.6s)]
*  Nothing's going to change, Pete, until Trump becomes president. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=84.25999999999999s)]
*  Let's be very, very clear. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=86.94s)]
*  Where is the federal government? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=89.42s)]
*  Where's the Department of Justice? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=91.78s)]
*  Where's the FBI? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=93.38s)]
*  Where's the Department of Education? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=94.5s)]
*  Pete, have you seen any federal arrests? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  Have you seen any federal troops over there protecting Jewish American students? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=98.3s)]
*  This is the Michigan strategy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=104.14s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember, Pete, in Mississippi, in Alabama, where Americans, federal troops [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=106.42s)]
*  were sent in to protect black kids. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=112.76s)]
*  Jewish American students have been abandoned by this administration because they want to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=114.68s)]
*  win Michigan. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=120.04s)]
*  It is plain and simple. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=121.04s)]
*  It will not change until Trump is president. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=122.04s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=125.2s)]
*  To think we will see scenes, we could see scenes like that, and almost no one's been [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  held accountable. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=131.34s)]
*  A couple of university presidents moved along, but behind it, things have not changed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=132.34s)]
*  Let's go to California real quick. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=138.02s)]
*  A couple of topics there. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  Your home state. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=141.6s)]
*  San Francisco is launching a $3 million audit of the city's 98 statues and monuments to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=143.44s)]
*  figure out which ones no longer represent the city's values and should be removed. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=149.6s)]
*  Apparently, there's outside money that's funding this. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=154.56s)]
*  What statues are we talking about? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=158.44s)]
*  I've got to believe they've taken any offensive ones down a long time ago, Leo. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=159.88s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=163.24s)]
*  This is what they want to do. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=165.48s)]
*  They want to eliminate—this is so shameful, besides being a schoolteacher and a civil [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=166.48s)]
*  They want to erase white male history. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=170.6s)]
*  They want to take down Ben Franklin. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=172.64s)]
*  Francis Scott Key, Ulysses S. Grant. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  They want to eliminate white history. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=178.11999999999998s)]
*  And I'll tell you this, Pete, this is very important because you're in the education. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=181.48s)]
*  First the monuments, then the history books. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  It's going to continue. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  So this is what's going to happen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  Francis Scott Key, the guy who wrote our Star Spangled Banner. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=192.27999999999997s)]
*  And Benjamin Franklin. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=197.92s)]
*  So their sin is being older white guys in an era they didn't like. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=199.8s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=203.84s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=205.88000000000002s)]
*  They're attacking white males. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=207.12s)]
*  First the monuments, then the history books, and then completely elimination. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  They want to erase our American history. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=212.60000000000002s)]
*  Okay, that's where we're at. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=215.24s)]
*  It doesn't surprise me. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=217.08s)]
*  San Francisco, it's exactly where the Democrat Party is. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=218.08s)]
*  They're already rewriting our textbooks. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=219.88000000000002s)]
*  Of course, they're going to take more statues down if it serves their purpose of 15 minutes [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=220.88000000000002s)]
*  ago. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=225.16000000000003s)]
*  Let's stick in California for a second. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=226.16000000000003s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi was on Real Time with Bill Maher and she talked about a new California bill [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=227.92s)]
*  that gives illegal immigrants money toward perching a home. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=237.16s)]
*  Giving government assistance to undocumented immigrants to buy houses. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  That's kind of a different place than the Democratic Party used to be on immigration. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=245.83999999999997s)]
*  Well, let me just say, immigration had always been a bipartisan issue. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  I refer you to the- [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=255.04s)]
*  But not free houses. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=256.56s)]
*  Well, that's not free housing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=257.56s)]
*  It's the American dream, being available to more people. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=260.2s)]
*  Does AB 1840, a law recently passed that gives the housing authority there the ability to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=263.68s)]
*  give free money to illegals for homes? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=270.96s)]
*  Yeah, and let me just simply say this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=275.16s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi, I saw that interview. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=277.52s)]
*  She's lying. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=279.08s)]
*  Listen, bipartisan support for immigration? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=280.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=282.12s)]
*  Democrats, Pete, want illegal immigration. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=283.12s)]
*  Americans want legal immigration. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=285.44s)]
*  What they want are new voters in California and America. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=287.32s)]
*  Basically, they're allowing Americans to subsidize illegal conduct by giving them free [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=291.8s)]
*  homes. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=297.48s)]
*  Gavin Newsom will commit political suicide if he signs that bill. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=298.48s)]
*  It is ridiculous and it insults every American citizen. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=302.0s)]
*  California is horrible. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=305.28s)]
*  You woke me up. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=306.28s)]
*  You gave me a nightmare. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=307.28s)]
*  California is in bad shape, Pete. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=308.28s)]
*  It is. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=310.32s)]
*  So you're saying the bill has not been signed yet, so he's an opportunity to block it at [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=311.32s)]
*  this point. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=314.4s)]
*  If he wants any chance to become a national figure in 2028, he should not sign that bill. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=316.35999999999996s)]
*  Veto that bill. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=322.84s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi enjoyed being the kingmaker. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=324.12s)]
*  Since she got rid of Biden, now she wants to control California. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  There are lots of Americans, many watching right now. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  American citizens who can't afford a new home and the idea that we're spending tax dollars [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=333.35999999999996s)]
*  for illegals, you're precisely right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=338.08s)]
*  Leo Terrell, great to see you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=340.56s)]
*  Who broke the law? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  Who broke the law. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  Thank you, Pete. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=344.03999999999996s)]
*  See you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRmPsb9RNI&t=345.04s)]
