# Kristi Noem responds to backlash from Dems: 'They're completely out of touch'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ)
*  And newly minted Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is hitting the ground running and forcing President Trump's immigration agenda [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining federal agencies here in New York City [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Noem says among those arrested was the ringleader of that vicious Venezuelan gang Trinidad, Uruguay [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=10.96s)]
*  And now she has a big announcement on additional measures DHS is ready to take to take in this is a Fox and Friends exclusive [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=17.28s)]
*  That's right. So Secretary Kristi Noem joins us right now [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=24.92s)]
*  Madam Secretary, good morning and congratulations. Welcome. Good morning. Thank you. It's wonderful to be with all of you [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=28.419999999999998s)]
*  Okay, the exclusive announcement is we are withdrawing the Venezuelan temporary status directive [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=33.86s)]
*  What I remember when my orcas jam that through what does that mean? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=41.46s)]
*  Well before he left town mayor has signed an order that said for 18 months they were going to extend this protection [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=46.46s)]
*  To people that are in temporary protected status [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=54.38s)]
*  Which means they were going to be able to stay here and violate our laws for another 18 months and we stopped that today [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=56.78s)]
*  We signed an executive order within the Department of Homeland Security in a direction that we were not going to follow through on what he did [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=62.22s)]
*  To tie our hands that we are going to follow the process evaluate all of these individuals that are in our country [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=68.7s)]
*  Including the Venezuelans that are here and members of TDA listen [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=74.38s)]
*  I was in New York City yesterday and the people of this country want these dirtbags out [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=77.38s)]
*  They want their communities to be safe [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=82.5s)]
*  It was so amazing to me to see people walk by us on the street early in the morning and just say thank you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for being here [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=89.94s)]
*  So this is part of our plan to make sure that we're protecting America keeping it safe again, just like President Trump promised [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=91.3s)]
*  There's some Democratic leaders that are pushing back against these ice raids, I don't get it [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=99.06s)]
*  But here's here's some of the comments from these Democratic leaders [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  Stand together firmly in our welcoming city status the type of fear that this administration is trying to incite [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=107.53999999999999s)]
*  We are demonstrating that we are going to protect the residents of this city [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=115.97999999999999s)]
*  It is performative theater and it's nothing more than shock and awe our local law enforcement will stand up for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=120.14s)]
*  Those law-abiding [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=127.82s)]
*  Undocumented people in our state the message that I'm hearing from them [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=130.06s)]
*  I know the message I'm hearing from them is we want to protect the rapist that's here illegally [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=134.06s)]
*  We want to protect that person that was arrested over the last few days that has ties to Isis [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=139.14000000000001s)]
*  We want to protect the man who allegedly murdered his girlfriend who was pregnant and a mother of two [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=143.98000000000002s)]
*  What are you what is your why are they why do they have a problem with arresting these career criminals that are here illegally? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=150.34s)]
*  They're completely out of touch with the people in their cities and communities [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=156.78s)]
*  That's exactly what these Democrat leaders are saying is we want to protect the cartels. We want to protect the gangs [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=160.0s)]
*  We want to make sure that people continue to die from guns violence and drugs and it's wrong and they're gonna find out very soon [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=165.28s)]
*  That their communities are not with them and listen yesterday. We picked up one of the ringleaders of TDA [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=171.96s)]
*  He had just been a part of a gun [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=177.4s)]
*  Weapons exchange and was trying to buy grenades [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=179.96s)]
*  Why would anybody in this country need to buy a grenade and go out and perpetuate violence? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=182.64s)]
*  He was one of those that was involved in Colorado in Aurora and we're so thankful we got him off the streets and what I've [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=187.6s)]
*  Continuously said to people is [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=194.45999999999998s)]
*  You know, what do you say to Lake and Riley's family? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=196.4s)]
*  We're gonna sign that bill today and to law the president will in the Oval Office [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=198.64s)]
*  To make sure we're going after these criminals [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  But the president's taking action and what was amazing is you'll hear people and Democrat leaders in different cities [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=204.66s)]
*  Like New York City some of their city council members have tried to attack what we're doing as far as enforcing our laws [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  But the people on the streets are not with them [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=217.8s)]
*  It was amazing to hear people and see them as they walked by taking their kids to school [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=219.96s)]
*  Going to work just walk by us and quietly say thank you. Thank you for being here [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=224.36s)]
*  And it means the world to those officers are out there risking their lives to bring safety back [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=228.44s)]
*  So madam secretary you guys your men and women are doing a fantastic job. It's a dangerous job those fugitive tax force [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  It's a risky business [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=239.04s)]
*  It's easy in the sense from a PR perspective to get the criminals [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=241.04s)]
*  No one wants and unless you're deranged want the criminals on the street the violent criminals [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  What I worry about is the PR when you guys go to the next layer of people that have over saved their visas are [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=250.28s)]
*  Work doing other jobs. How do you guys overcome that because we you've been in politics for a long time [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=256.88s)]
*  American people can be fickle [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=262.28s)]
*  They support something at one point and then the news media puts a crying child or someone on TV and they change [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=263.64s)]
*  So how are y'all gonna handle that portion? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=270.12s)]
*  I think we keep talking to people and talk to them about the fact that this is an America where a [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=272.12s)]
*  Justice is applied equally [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  You know [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=278.96s)]
*  We can't say that American citizens have to follow the law and then say that people from this other countries don't have to you [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  Know we choose laws we put them in place [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=285.36s)]
*  Congress has the chance to change the law [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=288.2s)]
*  But until then our job is to enforce it and when you want to live in a country where everybody's treated the same and fairly and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=290.2s)]
*  Equally and has a chance to live the American dream [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=296.84s)]
*  So we understand that there's some families who have been here illegally and have been [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=299.56s)]
*  perpetuating that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=304.88s)]
*  That's a discussion that we're gonna have to continue to have and see if we can fix our legal immigration system as well [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  That's one of my jobs is you know, not only are we going after those that are here illegally? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=312.0s)]
*  But we have to do due diligence and making sure we have the resources to process paperwork in a timely manner and so more [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=316.0s)]
*  Immigration courts and judges getting those kind of resources through Congress is important to make sure we're not just securing the border [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  We're deporting these dangerous individuals and then fixing our broken system and also legal work visas for the construction industry and other things like that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=328.24s)]
*  Because there's people with great work ethics real quick [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=335.47999999999996s)]
*  What are you gonna do with the Venezuelans the Cubans that when they don't these countries don't want to take them back [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=337.76s)]
*  You got six hundred and seven thousand Venezuelans here. What do we do? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=342.7s)]
*  Well, we have a fantastic secretary of state in secretary Rubio and he has been doing incredible work [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=346.21999999999997s)]
*  You know the other night I was talking to him on the phone at one o'clock in the morning [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=352.18s)]
*  and he was up and still discussing negotiations with other countries and working with his people and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=356.53999999999996s)]
*  In these countries to do diplomatic relations and the president clearly will exercise all the authority and power that he has to make these countries [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=362.09999999999997s)]
*  Take him back. So you're ruling out Kidmo. Oh [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=369.26s)]
*  Yeah, we're evaluating and talking about that right now [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=372.09999999999997s)]
*  So president's decision but it's an asset and we're gonna continue to look at how we can use all of our assets to keep America safe [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC21izRX8pQ&t=375.14s)]
