# 'Horrific crime': New details revealed about pro-Palestine shooter
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o)
*  Alright some serious nose the man accused of killing two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington DC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=0.0s)]
*  Could face the death penalty for what the Justice Department is calling an act of terrorism [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=5.62s)]
*  Madeline Rivera joins us now from outside the Capitol Jewish Museum with the latest [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=12.18s)]
*  Good morning guys [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=20.16s)]
*  Investigators say the charges they brought against the suspect yesterday are only the beginning and there could be more coming depending on the evidence [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=21.48s)]
*  this is a horrific crime and these crimes are not going to be tolerated by me and by this office [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=28.2s)]
*  Anti-Semitism will not be tolerated [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=36.92s)]
*  especially in the nation's capital [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=39.92s)]
*  And we're going to continue to investigate this as a hate crime and a crime of terrorism [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=42.28s)]
*  So for now 31 year old Elias Rodriguez is facing two counts of first-degree murder along with firearm charges [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=50.84s)]
*  Court papers present the shooting as calculated [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=57.63999999999999s)]
*  Authorities say Rodriguez flew to DC from Chicago on May 20th with a gun [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=60.64s)]
*  He told police he had bought a ticket for the event at the Capitol Jewish Museum three hours before it began on Wednesday [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=65.28s)]
*  Surveillance video showed Rodriguez shooting the victims [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=71.96s)]
*  26 year old Sarah Milgram and 30 year old Yaron Lashinsky both staffers for the Israeli Embassy as [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=74.88s)]
*  Milgram tried to crawl away Rodriguez approached her and fired at her again emptying out more than 20 rounds in total in the attack [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=80.88s)]
*  He allegedly told police I did it for Palestine. I did it for Gaza. I am unarmed [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=88.52s)]
*  Rodriguez was holding a red scarf identified by one witness as a cafe and his officers were escorting Rodriguez from the museum [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=94.28s)]
*  He shouted free Palestine moving forward police will be speaking to the people who knew Rodriguez trying to learn more about him [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  They'll be coming through his social media accounts and going through writings that are believed to have been published by him [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=108.04s)]
*  They are also asking for the public's help to help fill in the gaps between May 20th when the suspect arrived here in DC and May 21st [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=113.12s)]
*  When that shooting happened at the Capitol Jewish Museum behind me guys back to you [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  Thanks, man. Thanks, man. I just gotta say this guy is a coward because he shot him in the back execution style [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  That's why he's getting charged with first-degree murder. Probably is gonna get the death penalty [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=130.84s)]
*  Has a manifesto that's out but he targeted people that were directly trying to get aid to Gaza [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=134.12s)]
*  so I mean if [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=140.68s)]
*  You have been condemning the Israeli government and you don't like the way that they're conducting or what you don't like about the foreign aid [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  This group these diplomats were trying to get aid there and you executed them [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=149.56s)]
*  Well, it's also you know with all this condemnation towards Israel. What is the appropriate response to a 9-eleven type attack? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=155.16000000000003s)]
*  Which is what Israel suffered? What is the appropriate response? I mean you look at just the first six months after 9-eleven here [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=162.14s)]
*  We dropped [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=168.14s)]
*  1228 cluster bombs with [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=170.26s)]
*  248,000 bomb lets on Afghanistan you saw a huge displacement of people as a result [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=172.82s)]
*  So what is the appropriate response when you have your women killed when you have your children killed when you have your people taken hostage? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=177.94s)]
*  Like what is the appropriate response for the people condemning Israel? Yeah, not just Israel's response to Hamas [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=184.42s)]
*  But Americans response here or some are Americans a lot aren't to what Israel is doing has turned into all these pro-Palestinian [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=189.86s)]
*  Which are now pro-hamas [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=198.86s)]
*  Protests on universities where they're literally almost physically attacking Jewish students [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  Well Trump administration says no more secretary no more is that universities need to get your act together and the Trump administration has terminated [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=206.34s)]
*  Harvard student visas. Yeah, we're talking about [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=214.02s)]
*  according to the data that they have [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  27 percent of their population [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=219.7s)]
*  I want to know why they're having 27 percent of international students when it's so competitive to get in this school a lot of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  Americans want to go there, but all they've asked the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=228.45999999999998s)]
*  Harvard to do is turn over the video camera of all these protests and what was going on treat the Jewish population as [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=232.1s)]
*  You would treat any other [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=239.82s)]
*  Population stop the blocking of the Jews from going to the class and Harvard does not want a buckle [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  And this is just another way to hit their bottom line Lisa [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=247.82s)]
*  Well, it's also you know, I just love common sense, right? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=251.82s)]
*  And if you're a country that wants to do harm to the United States [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=254.78s)]
*  Would you not use our universities as a way to try to do harm to the country and and look over the past four years [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=257.74s)]
*  Under the Biden administration. We talked a lot about illegal immigration and clearly everyone's seeing the impact and also that playing out a role in the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=263.86s)]
*  Election with immigration being the second most important issue to voters [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=271.06s)]
*  But now we need to have a conversation about legal immigration and who are we letting into this country and what is that vetting process? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=274.04s)]
*  Look like for some of these visas to allow some of these individuals to come to the United States who by the way hate us [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=279.8s)]
*  Hater values hate what we believe here. And why are we letting them into the United States Joey? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=285.68s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think the Trump administration is gonna tolerate it much anymore [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=289.88s)]
*  These are some of the things they're doing to put universities in check so that they actually care about this country [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  They they revoke the authorization to enroll international students [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=298.96000000000004s)]

*  launched at least eight investigations [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  Asked the IRS to revoke the university's tax exempt status now [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=311.64s)]
*  Understand that most of these universities especially the Ivy League. I went to Georgetown. They have a multi-billion dollar trust [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=315.72s)]
*  It's not like down these endowment. It's not like these universities are gonna be bankrupt and can't provide scholarships [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=321.88s)]
*  They're gonna have to be more diligent and who they provide scholarships to and they have to dig into some of that money [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=328.72s)]
*  That's just actually ironically working in a capitalist system to earn more money for them, which is what they're doing with those [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  Endowments as opposed to taxpayer dollars. The message is very [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=340.24s)]
*  Simple it's coming from the president. It's coming from the DHS secretary. Get your act together. Yes, the secretary [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=344.52000000000004s)]

*  This should be a warning to every other university to get your act together [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=370.64s)]
*  Get your act together because we are coming to make sure that these programs [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAiKxRJ1b2o&t=373.88s)]
