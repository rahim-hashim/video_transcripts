# Trump touts 'Golden Age' of America during commencement speech: 'More promising tomorrow'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI)
*  President Trump addressing the University of Alabama's class of 2025, encouraging them to excel and embrace the future. Listen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=0.0s)]
*  Today I'm also asking you to look forward to really something very, very bright and more promising. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=9.0s)]
*  And it's going to be an even more promising tomorrow. I promise you that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=16.0s)]
*  You're the first graduating class of the Golden Age of America. We're in the Golden Age. You watch. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=20.0s)]
*  Well, here to discuss campus reform correspondents and officially graduates of the University of Alabama, Jackson Beals and Mary Elizabeth Miller. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=26.0s)]
*  Hey, everyone. Good morning. How are you doing? Great. Congratulations. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=36.0s)]
*  So, Mary Elizabeth, I'll start with you. Tell me what it was like. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=41.0s)]
*  You said you all were when you all were seniors, you all were the product of the pandemic. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=44.0s)]
*  So you needed this message of hope. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=48.0s)]
*  Absolutely. I graduated during the pandemic and then attended college behind math most of the time. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=51.0s)]
*  It was an honor and privilege to hear him speak last night. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=58.0s)]
*  He was so empowering and inspirational. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=63.0s)]
*  He spoke of change and how we have to have hope for the future and that we will be victorious if we just stay determined and work hard. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=67.0s)]
*  Yes. And how about you, Jackson? You said you were walking into the stadium and there were people that were trying to organize a walkout. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=78.0s)]
*  How did how did that work out for them? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=85.0s)]
*  There was. It was actually a friend of mine trying to organize the walkout. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=87.0s)]
*  It it didn't go well. There was roughly 10 or so people that walked out. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=91.0s)]
*  They weren't even noticeable. But overall, he was embraced well by the campus, a rather conservative campus and a rather conservative state. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=97.0s)]
*  For the most part, class of 2025 was so honored and so happy to have him there. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=106.0s)]
*  Well, almost 7000 people in your graduating class. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=110.0s)]
*  So it was the largest graduating class of in history of Alabama. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=113.0s)]
*  What did you like most? What really resonated with you and what what are your friends saying about it? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=117.0s)]
*  Mary Elizabeth, one of my favorite points that he made was that the next chapter of American history will not be made by the Princeton's nor the Harvards of the world. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=122.0s)]
*  But rather the Crimson Tide. I am so extremely proud to be a graduate of the University of Alabama. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=134.0s)]
*  This is where legends are made. And I think everyone in my class can say that we are extremely proud to be graduates. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=140.0s)]
*  We are extremely proud to be coming into the workforce at this time in the most most opportune time in American history. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=147.0s)]
*  And we are just so excited and proud. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=155.0s)]
*  There's a picture of you. You're pretty close to the president. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=157.0s)]
*  Yeah, the line that he said last night that I loved was next chapter will not be written by the Harvard Crimson. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=161.0s)]
*  It will be written by the Crimson Tide. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=168.0s)]
*  And the crowd went crazy and he was like, how do you like that line? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=170.0s)]
*  I came up with that line. Jackson, how about for you? What's what stood out? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=173.0s)]
*  That was amazing. Again, that was one of my favorite lines. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=177.0s)]
*  But what really stood out to me was that his message wasn't really a political one. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=181.0s)]
*  It was one of motivation, one of like enthusiasm about entering adulthood, entering the workforce. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=186.0s)]
*  And another thing that I appreciated was that I saw people that I knew from my graduating class on both sides of the political spectrum [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=194.0s)]
*  coming together to just support having the president there and support the class of 2025 and all in all, just being excited about the future. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=202.0s)]
*  Yeah. Mary Elizabeth, what are people saying? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=211.0s)]
*  What were they saying after graduation about his speech? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=213.0s)]
*  They were excited. They were. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=216.0s)]
*  I think he really lit a fire in the next generation of leaders. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=219.0s)]
*  He was so empowering and so encouraging. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=223.0s)]
*  His message was exactly what we needed to hear at this time. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=226.0s)]
*  And everybody walked away with smiles on their faces and just kept on talking about how they were so honored that he chose us over Auburn. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=230.0s)]
*  Jackson, Mary Elizabeth, thank you all so much. Congratulations, graduates. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=240.0s)]
*  It's an exciting time. Thank you. You're welcome. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=245.0s)]
*  Thank you. Have a great weekend. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPYE-UKNrxI&t=248.0s)]
