# Duke grads rally behind Jerry Seinfeld after anti-Israel agitators disrupt his speech
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM)
*  So comedian Jerry Seinfeld, becoming the latest graduation speaker, forced to deal with anti-Israeli agitators. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=0.0s)]
*  But the crowd ultimately rallied behind the legendary comic as he shared his one-of-a-kind perspective on life. Watch. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=6.4s)]
*  Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=13.5s)]
*  Again, a lot of you are thinking, I can't believe they invited this guy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=28.2s)]
*  Too late. I say, use your privilege. I grew up a Jewish boy from New York. That is a privilege if you want to be a comedian. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=33.5s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=45.6s)]
*  Alana Paycar was in one of those seats graduating yesterday, and she joins us now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=48.4s)]
*  Alana, were you surprised to see this happen? You know, Jerry Seinfeld obviously is Jewish. He talked about the October 9th, October 7th, I'm sorry, attacked. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=53.300000000000004s)]
*  But he hasn't been out there talking about the war at all. So why did they target him? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=61.7s)]
*  You know, given Jerry's very outward Zionism and his openly Judaism, I can't say I am surprised given these protests. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=68.3s)]
*  It's very obvious that they oppose his point of view, but these students definitely went in there. They completely violated Duke's rules. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=77.5s)]
*  They made it very clear to students that they're not allowed to bring in any signs, any flags, and these students completely violated the rules of Duke University. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=84.9s)]
*  So Alana, you said that you weren't going to allow them to win. So it looks like the crowd overall at Duke University supported Jerry. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=92.5s)]
*  Absolutely. What you're not seeing on the media is that after these students walk out, and by the way, it's only 40 students, they walked out. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=102.5s)]
*  After they walked out, the entire stadium started booing them and eventually started chanting Jerry's name, clearly in support of him being our commencement speaker. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=109.7s)]
*  So I guess my question, because I've been at these rallies and these little gazes all across the country. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=118.1s)]
*  Would you say it's a small minority of them on these college campuses? Or do you see this growing movement? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=125.3s)]
*  Like, do you feel support at Duke University being a Jew? Or is it quite fearful for you? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=133.3s)]
*  You know, Lawrence, I'm actually very thankful to say that Duke University, unlike other universities, has been a much safer environment for Jewish students. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=141.3s)]
*  I'm somebody who's very openly Jewish, very openly Zionist, and I'm able to proudly walk around campus. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=150.3s)]
*  I wear my Jewish star necklace, and if there's anyone to be targeted, I feel like I'd be one of the first students. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=156.3s)]
*  And I can happily say that Duke has done everything in their power to ensure their safety for students. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=163.3s)]
*  Unfortunately, we cannot say the same for universities across America. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=168.3s)]
*  Real quickly, before I let you go, what do you think Duke is doing differently than the rest of the universities? Because I think it can be a model. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=173.3s)]
*  You know, I think there are many factors that go into this. One of them being that Duke has their rules and they abide by it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=180.3s)]
*  And they stick to it for every group on campus. It doesn't adjust based off of certain political beliefs, personal beliefs, identities. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=188.3s)]
*  Additionally, I genuinely believe Duke has done an amazing job in building a community on campus. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=197.3s)]
*  And what I am seeing on other college universities is that these students don't have a place on their campus. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=203.3s)]
*  They don't feel like they have meaning. They don't feel like they have a purpose. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=208.3s)]
*  And Duke has genuinely created a community that students feel a sense of fulfillment and don't feel the need to turn to this violence. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=211.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's such a good point because you see it all across the country where some Jewish students can't even go to class. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=219.3s)]
*  You have protesters blocking them from going to class. But at Duke it's much different because you got to follow the rules. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=225.3s)]
*  What a novel idea. Alana, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=232.3s)]
*  Thank you, Lawrence. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=235.3s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqoqWnFvwM&t=236.3s)]
