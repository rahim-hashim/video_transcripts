# Piers Morgan: Democrats are toxic for this one reason
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw)
*  Alright, the Democrat leader of one of America's most progressive states, torching his own [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=0.0s)]
*  party. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=6.84s)]
*  The Democratic brand is toxic right now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=8.84s)]
*  We had a high water mark two weeks ago and that was a CNN poll at 29% favorability. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  It's dropped in the NBC poll down to 27%. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  It's one thing to make noise, but you also have to make sense. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=20.02s)]
*  Democrat lawmakers pressed on their thoughts have this to say. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=23.8s)]
*  I don't think it's my job to help the Democrats come out of the wilderness. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=27.84s)]
*  It's my job to make sure that this is Maryland's decade. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=31.0s)]
*  I think that it is a brand that is, with all respect to my colleague from California, is [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=33.0s)]
*  associated with New York and with California. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=40.6s)]
*  The Democratic party ought to be able to come back under those circumstances with a pretty [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=43.8s)]
*  good argument about why we could lead better than Donald Trump. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=48.2s)]
*  Alright, here to react, he says he would, it's still up to you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  Pierce Morgan, the same Pierce Morgan who does Uncentered with Pierce Morgan. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=56.6s)]
*  A lot of fireworks. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=60.6s)]
*  What's your name again? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=61.6s)]
*  It's not important. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=62.6s)]
*  I'm a Fox and Friend, that's all that matters. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=63.6s)]
*  By the way, I turned 60 yesterday. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=65.6s)]
*  I know what you're thinking Ainsley. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=67.6s)]
*  Happy fifth day. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=68.6s)]
*  You can't be 60. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=69.6s)]
*  But I found to my utter, utter shock that you're only 10 months older than me. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=70.6s)]
*  I had you down for about five years. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=75.6s)]
*  I look like 10 years younger. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=77.6s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=78.6s)]
*  You guys are the British, you don't even know how to use moisturiser. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=79.6s)]
*  We know we don't need moisturiser. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=82.6s)]
*  You killed me today. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=84.6s)]
*  You're skinless good, you don't need moisturiser. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=86.6s)]
*  Okay, fine, let's go back to Democrats. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=88.6s)]
*  Happy birthday, Bob. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=90.6s)]
*  Thank you, thank you Ainsley. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=91.6s)]
*  As always, a touch of glass in the middle. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=92.6s)]
*  Right, absolutely. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=95.6s)]
*  Berating our guests. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=96.6s)]
*  Right, sorry, yeah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=97.6s)]
*  We're off to a bad start, but what did you think of what Gavin Newsom was saying about [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=98.6s)]
*  the party? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=101.6s)]
*  You know the thing about, talking about moisturiser, don't you think with Gavin Newsom, he probably [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=102.6s)]
*  takes longer to get ready than his wife. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=105.6s)]
*  Don't you think? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=108.6s)]
*  Okay, that's what... [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=109.6s)]
*  Would you agree with that Ainsley? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=110.6s)]
*  You're dating someone and they take longer than you do? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=111.6s)]
*  Come on. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=114.6s)]
*  He's so slick, it's just pouring off him. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=115.6s)]
*  It's interesting because of course one of the reasons the party's so toxic is because [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=118.6s)]
*  of people like Newsom, who are following these mad, crazy, woke, progressive left policies. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=121.6s)]
*  Now, to his credit, he, unlike a lot of the party, has realised they've got to move very, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=127.6s)]
*  very quickly back to the middle, or it's all over. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=132.6s)]
*  I mean, the Democrat polling is indescribably horrific. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=135.6s)]
*  But he's not as Governor. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=139.6s)]
*  Right now he's not moving. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=140.6s)]
*  I agree, I agree. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=141.6s)]
*  But he's not moving anything. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=142.6s)]
*  I don't think he cares about California anymore. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=143.6s)]
*  He sees an opportunity to run the party. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=146.6s)]
*  He's playing the sort of Bill Clinton thing, even the mannerisms, right? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=149.6s)]
*  You can see the way he's doing the interviews. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=152.6s)]
*  So it was very interesting, but the Democrats are toxic for one reason. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=154.6s)]
*  If you want to know why they're in the state they're in, just ask all of them two questions. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=157.6s)]
*  What is a woman and should biological men be in women's sport? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=162.6s)]
*  If they are unable to answer the first question, and if they say in the second one, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=166.6s)]
*  yeah, that's fine, that's the problem. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=171.6s)]
*  Right there, they have gone completely crackers. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=173.6s)]
*  And I say that as somebody who's more on the kind of Bill Ma side, particularly, I guess, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=177.6s)]
*  historically, but I agree with Bill. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=181.6s)]
*  That's why I'm pleased Bill's going to see President Trump. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=183.6s)]
*  They've got to get with the programme that common sense is where most Americans now want to be. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=185.6s)]
*  How do you think it's going to go? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=191.6s)]
*  Bill Ma did. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=192.6s)]
*  I want to be there, don't you? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=193.6s)]
*  Bill Rock, Dana White, President Trump, Bill Ma. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=194.6s)]
*  Not Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=198.6s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=199.6s)]
*  But I would love to be there. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=200.6s)]
*  I think it's great. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=201.6s)]
*  I'm actually doing Bill show in a couple of weeks. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=202.6s)]
*  I think he's a refreshing voice of common sense in a party that's gone mad. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=203.6s)]
*  And I think he could have said no, but actually, yes, as he said, and I really like this, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=208.6s)]
*  there's something incredibly respectful about being invited to the White House, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=214.6s)]
*  and it's a great honour to be invited to the White House. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=218.6s)]
*  How do you think the party is going to respond to that? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=221.6s)]
*  Oh, well, all the woke left will go completely nuts. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=223.6s)]
*  They'll probably go around and torch his car like they're doing to Elon Musk [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=226.6s)]
*  because they have no way of combating policy. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=230.6s)]
*  Look at the Elon Musk thing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=233.6s)]
*  Again, if you want to know how nuts these people have got, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=235.6s)]
*  Elon Musk has sacrificed his business stuff for however long he's going to do this, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=237.6s)]
*  for no money, he's leading a team of people to try and reduce government overspending and waste. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=243.6s)]
*  I wish he was doing that to the federal government in the UK. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=249.6s)]
*  And what's his reward? All over America now, people torching Teslas, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=252.6s)]
*  petrol bombing them, targeting people who are driving Teslas. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=256.6s)]
*  I said on X last night, this is making me want to go and buy a Tesla, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=260.6s)]
*  to which Elon replied, thank you, because I'm sure he's feeling a little bit vulnerable right now [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=265.6s)]
*  in terms of his business being actively targeted and they're trying to destroy it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=270.6s)]
*  And his electric car. The Democrats love the electric cars. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=274.6s)]
*  Sorry, these people used to love Elon Musk. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=277.6s)]
*  They used to see him as the savior, the green energy guy, bringing these cars to America. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=280.6s)]
*  They all loved him. And now because he has aligned himself to Donald Trump, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=288.6s)]
*  now he's the enemy and they can't crush him on policy, they want to crush him with violence. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=292.6s)]
*  I think it's disgusting. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=297.6s)]
*  This made me feel better. Only 100 people showed up to one of the rallies at the Tesla plant. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=298.6s)]
*  But in New York it was a big one. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=303.6s)]
*  And they've happened all over the world, but I think it's going to backfire, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=304.6s)]
*  because he's trying to save us money so that we don't go bankrupt so we can keep our country. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=308.6s)]
*  I watched, I thought the Bret Baer thing was fascinating. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=312.6s)]
*  So good. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=315.6s)]
*  Really good, wasn't it, with Elon and all those other business leaders who have all given up their time. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=316.6s)]
*  And the way they talked through what they're doing and what they're finding, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=320.6s)]
*  the scale of the waste is actually terrifying. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=324.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=327.6s)]
*  And the idea that for exposing this and for saving Americans money, which is what they're doing, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=328.6s)]
*  you then become the devil who must be targeted, destroyed with violence, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=333.6s)]
*  I think is a shameful moment for everybody on the left in America. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=338.6s)]
*  And they've got to stop this right now. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=342.6s)]
*  Go to Fox Nation, watch the whole thing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=344.6s)]
*  It's brilliant. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=346.6s)]
*  Thank you, Pierce. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=347.6s)]
*  We're crunching later. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=348.6s)]
*  Now I am carrying a severe ankle injury. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=350.6s)]
*  Oh, don't you start. You do the same thing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=353.6s)]
*  But because I still feel bad about the War of Independence and how that all played out, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=355.6s)]
*  I've decided to put horrific personal injury and pain to one side. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_gEpM7qCXw&t=361.6s)]
