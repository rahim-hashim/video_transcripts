# NYPD working to contain migrant gang threat as 1 million gather for NYE
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw)
*  All right, with New Year's Eve preparations in the final stages, the NYPD is ready for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=0.0s)]
*  the potential threat of Trendy Aragwa today and into 2025. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=5.08s)]
*  This is an issue that we're dealing with, not specific to New Year's Eve, Times Square, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=10.36s)]
*  but some newly emergent threats, newly emergent crime patterns that we have, again, tried [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=17.96s)]
*  to combat very early and very deeply so that we haven't had the entrenchment of some of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=25.72s)]
*  this gang here in the city that you've seen elsewhere across the country. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, this comes as NYPD data shows that a record number of officers were injured by [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=36.56s)]
*  violent suspects this year. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=41.28s)]
*  That's up 13% from last year. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=43.44s)]
*  Joining us now is former head of counterterrorism operations for the NYPD and Fox News contributor [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=46.16s)]
*  Paul Morrow. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Good morning, Paul. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  You hear this, you know, acute threat of Trendy Aragwa, but it's kind of this larger issue [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=54.6s)]
*  of how the city has handled illegal immigrants that have come to the city. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  Is this something that we should look at and say, hey, this is a really big threat for [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=63.84s)]
*  tonight's celebrations, or is it really something that just is here all the time? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=66.68s)]
*  I would say the latter. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=72.04s)]
*  This is something that the city's been dealing with now for a couple of years, but specific [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=73.44s)]
*  to New Year's Eve, I don't think it is something that anybody who's coming to the event really [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=77.04s)]
*  needs to have on the agenda. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=82.6s)]
*  There are other things to worry about. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=84.56s)]
*  Watch yourself relative to pickpockets and things like that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=86.36s)]
*  Understand that once you get into a pen and time square, you're not going to leave, and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=89.56s)]
*  if you do, you can't come back in. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  Measures like that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=94.6s)]
*  But in terms of a Trendy Aragwa threat specific to the New Year's event, the PD is on this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=95.6s)]
*  They have a lot of resources, even as tight as it is for them relative to recruitment [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=103.08s)]
*  and retention. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=109.12s)]
*  They are out pretty far ahead on this Trendy Aragwa thing and the gang threat in general [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=110.12s)]
*  that we've seen grow out of the migrant crisis. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=116.28s)]
*  So I think that tonight will be fine relative to that issue. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=119.12s)]
*  Yeah, when we talk about why this crime from illegal immigrants is so, I guess, so acute [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=122.4s)]
*  in New York City and why it's felt so much, this is a great quote here that kind of tells [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  you where police officers are on it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  It says, an unnamed officer with two decades of experience told the New York Post, a lot [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  more migrants assault cops than regular citizens. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=138.92s)]
*  This comes as the lady we just saw speaking, let's see if I can grab her name real quick, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=142.55999999999997s)]
*  but she's the deputy commissioner. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=147.27999999999997s)]
*  She said that basically these violent criminals are, they're without consequence. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  And so they don't have consequence for attacking police officers. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=158.67999999999998s)]
*  Now police officers say, yeah, they're doing it worse. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, a lot of the migrants, particularly the gang bangers, they come from some really [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=167.96s)]
*  rough terrain. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=171.96s)]
*  Remember that Trendy Aragwa specifically is a prison gang and a Venezuelan prison gang [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=172.96s)]
*  is a crew that is used to doing battle with the police in Venezuela. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=179.4s)]
*  They apparently exchange gunfire with the police regularly and they put out to their [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=184.08s)]
*  members here in America that, and specifically in New York, that, hey, it's okay to shoot [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  at the police because they shoot at us. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=193.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=195.4s)]
*  They're used to back home and they've brought some of that here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=196.84s)]
*  And so, yeah, you know, the cops that are dealing with them are aware of the fact that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=201.52s)]
*  they'll act with impunity and realistically they don't have a whole lot to lose. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=204.32s)]
*  I mean, they're being given everything they want here. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=208.24s)]
*  We don't seem to have any mechanism to get them out. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=210.52s)]
*  They know that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=212.68s)]
*  They're very adept at playing the system. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=213.68s)]
*  They know the system before they even get here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=215.76s)]
*  And so, yeah, there is a level of impunity and arrogance that's coming out of these gangs, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=218.12s)]
*  specifically this gang. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  And until we wake up, when Tom Homan comes in on 20 January and Donald Trump starts to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=225.28s)]
*  do battle, and it's going to be a battle, a legalistic battle with the sanctuary cities [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  and states, this kind of thing is going to go on because they're very aware of the fact [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  that they have essentially a protected status. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, actually, that was the Sergeant's Benevolent Association president that said that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  So the person speaking for police officers and their concerns says, listen, there aren't [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=246.32s)]
*  any consequences for these migrants that are attacking police officers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  I think it's pretty amazing to have literally the NYPD say, can't do our job. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=254.84s)]
*  And while we're not doing, not able to do our job, we're getting attacked. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=260.2s)]
*  Paul Morrow, you know that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for continuing to cover it and come on about it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=265.92s)]
*  We appreciate your service to the city. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqPUx-DFLw&t=268.2s)]
