# ‘Good riddance’: Noem backs judge’s ruling on Khalil deportation #foxnews #immigration #politics
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do_IoM8Kmis)
*  Big win for the Trump administration after an immigration judge on Friday rules Mahmoud Khalil can be deported over his involvement leading last year's anti-Israel protest just up the road here at Columbia University. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do_IoM8Kmis&t=0.0s)]
*  The DHS secretary Kristi Noem welcoming the decision saying Friday quote when you advocate for violence glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans and harassed Jews you should not be in this country adding good riddance. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do_IoM8Kmis&t=14.0s)]
*  Here to react former federal prosecutor Nima Ramani and so the ruling here what should we know about this Nima and how long is the appeal process going to go and where from here does this lead us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do_IoM8Kmis&t=33.0s)]
*  Clay there's two cases here and what we're talking about is immigration court in Louisiana and there the judge ruled that under section 237 and the immigration and nationality act the secretary of state here Marco Rubio can remove a green card holder if he reasonably believes that they're going to harm American foreign policy interests. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do_IoM8Kmis&t=47.0s)]
*  That's what happened here and then the judge also didn't need to roll in the second issue which was whether Khalil committed fraud during the naturalization process when he applied for that green card. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do_IoM8Kmis&t=67.0s)]
