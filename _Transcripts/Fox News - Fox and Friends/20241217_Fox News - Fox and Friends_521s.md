# 'No end in sight': Chicago hearing ERUPTS into chaos over migrant spending
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs)
*  The Chicago City Council narrowly approving Mayor Brandon Johnson's 2025 budget, including [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=0.0s)]
*  a controversial $40 million short-term loan for a city already swimming in debt, all part [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  of a chaotic meeting where residents slammed the mayor. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=11.4s)]
*  You caused all this money to go to illegal immigrants. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=15.36s)]
*  Anything that you all pass is not genuine. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=19.6s)]
*  You have not protected the people of Chicago from invasion. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=22.72s)]
*  He wants to pour a $40 million line of credit and put the city in even more debt. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=26.4s)]
*  It's your fault that because you gave half the money to illegals. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=33.72s)]
*  Chicago reporter William Kelly joins me now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=38.48s)]
*  William, you were inside that budget vote. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=41.4s)]
*  How embarrassing was this for Mayor Brandon Johnson, even with the budget ultimately passing? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=43.84s)]
*  Even after it passed, nobody applauded, Todd. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=50.68s)]
*  As a lifelong Chicagoan, I love Chicago with all my heart. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=53.48s)]
*  I'm not a Chicago basher, and I love those people. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  It brings tears to my eyes, Todd, who came to Chicago City Hall week after week. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=60.76s)]
*  It took four times for this budget to finally pass. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=66.56s)]
*  $17 billion. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=70.16s)]
*  These real Chicagoans, they made their voices heard. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=72.64s)]
*  They made it clear. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=75.72s)]
*  They don't trust Brandon Johnson, Mayor Johnson, with 50 cents. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  They know he's just going to spend that money on migrants and violent teenagers. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=81.84s)]
*  Brandon Johnson says it himself, Todd. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=87.84s)]
*  You've been coming on this show for years. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=91.6s)]
*  Your passion for the Windy City is definitely noted during each appearance. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=93.24s)]
*  You mentioned the migrant. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=97.76s)]
*  Brandon Johnson, under his tutelage, under his leadership, Chicago has spent $527 million [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=99.04s)]
*  taxpayer dollars on migrants. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=106.88s)]
*  So my question for you, William, would Mayor Johnson have had an easier time passing a [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=109.44s)]
*  budget if, oh, I don't know, he didn't spend so much money for illegal migrants at the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=113.28s)]
*  expense of taxpaying city residents? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, that was almost to the penny the amount that Mayor Johnson wanted to raise property [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=120.52s)]
*  taxes on the real people of Chicago. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=128.64s)]
*  Thankfully, I had the opportunity to call it out as a migrant tax, which motivated people [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=132.56s)]
*  to come to Chicago City Call Hall and literally shout at the mayor, which I guess is what [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=138.68s)]
*  was necessary. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  But yet Mayor Johnson still got the votes from his friends and allies in the Chicago [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  City Council. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=152.8s)]
*  The vice mayor, here's an example of where we're at in Chicago right now, Todd. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=154.44s)]
*  The vice mayor, a guy named Alderman Burnett, convicted of bank robbery, of armed robbery, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=158.72s)]
*  of time in jail. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=168.56s)]
*  He's a Chicago City Alderman. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=170.24s)]
*  He's getting paid, in addition to his automatic salary, for almost half a mil, okay, to be [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  vice mayor, which essentially has absolutely no duties or responsibilities other than waiting [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=179.32000000000002s)]
*  to possibly become mayor if something were to happen to Mayor Johnson. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  So in Chicago, if you really, really, really want to rip off the people of Chicago, don't [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=190.94s)]
*  rob a bank, become an alderman. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=198.66s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=201.26s)]
*  That is a wild story you just told us. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=202.26s)]
*  The vote got so heated, the mayor basically cleared out the room, said he didn't want [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=203.9s)]
*  the citizens there. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=208.38s)]
*  This is their city. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=209.38s)]
*  They get an opportunity to weigh in on this, and the mayor said get out. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=211.02s)]
*  Has Chicago finally reached the tipping point that so many cities and towns, and quite frankly, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=214.3s)]
*  the United States of America reached in November with the vote, that they're finally going [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=219.78s)]
*  to vote out the Mayor Johnson's, the Mayor Lightfoot's, and bring some sanity back to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=224.54s)]
*  Chicago. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=229.14s)]
*  Well, it's an old joke, Todd. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=230.14s)]
*  Is Chicago ready for reform? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=232.58s)]
*  And the fact is that it might just be because we see this money going to migrants. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=235.54s)]
*  We, you know, I did some math myself, okay? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=242.86s)]
*  Mayor Johnson has 100 plus staffers. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=247.38s)]
*  They're all making six figures. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=250.66s)]
*  Many of them have become notorious as a result of, you know, at William J. Kelly on X, videos [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=253.76s)]
*  where I literally have to chase them down the hallways of City Hall to talk to them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  One of them in particular, Kennedy Barkley, is famous for saying F the pigs, okay? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=265.54s)]
*  This is what I guess her number one qualification for becoming a Mayor Johnson staffer, okay? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=273.26s)]
*  100 plus staffers, six figures apiece, adds up to millions upon millions of dollars out [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=278.74s)]
*  of the pockets of real Chicagoans. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=285.62s)]
*  Yeah, I think it might be, Chicagoans might be ready for some real change, some real reform, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=288.62s)]
*  Todd. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=295.42s)]
*  And despite everything you just said, the mayor wants to pay for all that, pay for the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=296.42s)]
*  migrants, pay for those ridiculous salaries by raising taxes on property. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=299.1s)]
*  That is wild. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=305.14000000000004s)]
*  William J. Kelly, thank you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=306.14000000000004s)]
*  Glad that didn't pass for the people of Chicago. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=307.22s)]
*  They need a break. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=309.42s)]
*  As chaos rubs over far left Chicago mayors, $40 million short-term loan and next year's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=310.42s)]
*  $17 billion budget, forcing Brandon Johnson to clear the public twice in order to get [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=317.14000000000004s)]
*  it passed. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=322.5s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=323.5s)]
*  This meeting will stand in recess. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=325.5s)]
*  I'm going to ask the president to get arms cleared and bring the member of the public. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=328.5s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=334.5s)]
*  After four tries, the budget passed by two votes, while Johnson championed the spending [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=335.5s)]
*  package as a new way forward for the city. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=339.62s)]
*  What's he talking about? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=342.62s)]
*  Our next guest is one of the 23 aldermen who voted against the budget. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=343.62s)]
*  Anthony Beale joins us now. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=347.58s)]
*  Anthony, bring us inside the room last night. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=349.1s)]
*  What was it like? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=351.46s)]
*  Well, it was total chaos. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=353.41999999999996s)]
*  When you look at everything that you saw just in that segment, it was just total chaos. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=354.41999999999996s)]
*  And we're trying to pass a budget. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=359.41999999999996s)]
*  We're trying to get real answers. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=361.41999999999996s)]
*  We're trying to do what's right by the people of the city of Chicago. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=362.41999999999996s)]
*  And we couldn't get real answers from the budget director. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=365.41999999999996s)]
*  We couldn't get the right information we needed to make a good, educated decision on [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=368.41999999999996s)]
*  how to move the city forward. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=373.41999999999996s)]
*  And we're still spending money, hundreds of millions of dollars on migrants. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=375.41999999999996s)]
*  And we want to continue to find and feed the people of the city of Chicago when we continue [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=380.38s)]
*  to spend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars on migrants. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=383.38s)]
*  And there's no end in sight because he doesn't want to cooperate with somebody who couldn't [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=386.38s)]
*  bring that number down by lessening the number coming in. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=390.38s)]
*  In fact, they say in Chicago, the numbers you're giving under Brandon Johnson, the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=393.38s)]
*  mayor, $527.5 million, let alone the inconvenience of seeing him in the airports and police stations [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=398.38s)]
*  and around. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=405.38s)]
*  I mean, obviously people are fed up. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=406.38s)]
*  Doesn't he hear this? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=409.34s)]
*  Well, we would hope he would hear it, but it doesn't seem like he does. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=411.34s)]
*  We've tried working with this mayor. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=414.34s)]
*  It's about 15 or 16 of us who have been around and know the city and know the budget very [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=416.34s)]
*  well. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=421.34s)]
*  And he won't even talk to us. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=422.34s)]
*  He won't even entertain our ideas about trying to right size the city of Chicago. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=423.34s)]
*  We tried to right size it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=428.34s)]
*  We tried, you know, our budget is extremely bloated. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=430.34s)]
*  We've increased our budget over $5 billion in the last four years. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=434.29999999999995s)]
*  We can't sustain that type of growth. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=439.29999999999995s)]
*  And so we tried to right size it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=441.29999999999995s)]
*  We tried to have cuts and efficiencies. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  And this mayor totally ignored all of that and wants to just continue to spend money. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=446.09999999999997s)]
*  So, Anthony, real quick for people outside the city, don't look at the budget you see. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYgKNOIxwxs&t=450.09999999999997s)]
