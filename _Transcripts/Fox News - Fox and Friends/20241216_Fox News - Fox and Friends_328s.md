# Doocy: This seems to be the Trump team's transition strategy
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM)
*  Peter Doocy joins us live from Washington with the details. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey Peter. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=3.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=4.2s)]
*  We've got a list of 25 senators. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=4.8s)]
*  RFK Jr. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=7.2s)]
*  plans to meet with on Capitol Hill this week. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=7.9s)]
*  He is of course part of the most famous family of Democrats in our nation's history. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  And yet none of these 25 senators are Democrats. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=14.4s)]
*  Instead the strategy for the transition team seems to be shore up the right flank, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=17.8s)]
*  minimize Republican defections and try to keep the focus on improvements to things [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  like the food supply and not on past controversial statements about vaccinations [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=27.9s)]
*  that would be unhelpful during a confirmation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  While the nominees are going through the official advice and consent process on the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=36.3s)]
*  Hill, cabinet picks were crammed into a box with the president-elect a few miles away [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=40.9s)]
*  at FedEx Field Saturday for the Army-Navy game. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=46.5s)]
*  Spotted were Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Hegseth and Ron DeSantis, widely reported as the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=49.5s)]
*  defense secretary backup if the Hegseth pick doesn't make it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=55.9s)]
*  Daniel Penny was in there too less than a week after a jury that could have sent him [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=60.0s)]
*  to jail didn't and then a few hundred miles south tech billionaires keep popping up at [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=64.5s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago hoping for Trump's blessing for various projects. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=70.8s)]
*  Sundar Pichai, the Google leader was just down according to Axios. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=74.3s)]
*  Jeff Bezos expected down there soon. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=78.9s)]
*  They are both going to want their hands in which regulations the next president puts [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=81.6s)]
*  on or doesn't put on AI and space projects back to you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=86.3s)]
*  So Peter normally it's so unusual to see you actually at the Bureau where I think [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=92.6s)]
*  technically you do have a desk, right? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=97.3s)]
*  I am here so little and Chad Pergram is here so little that we share a desk. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=100.3s)]
*  It is very dusty and we both have a lot of mail. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=106.4s)]
*  Chad, I will be reading it all today. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=109.5s)]
*  Lots of Christmas cards there, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=112.0s)]
*  How does this has the confirmation process work that won't start until after the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=113.4s)]
*  inauguration, right? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=118.1s)]
*  Well, these senators would consider it starting right now because the whole [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=119.7s)]
*  and I think with the process they want to talk to everybody but the confirmation [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=123.5s)]
*  hearings won't start until right after the inauguration and they'll figure out [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=127.7s)]
*  which which positions have the priority to go first. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=131.9s)]
*  Usually it's the National Security ones. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=135.4s)]
*  They go first like the first day or the second day of the new term and those [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=137.29999999999998s)]
*  tend to go pretty quickly and then they'll go from there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=142.6s)]
*  But so technically it's got a couple weeks to go but it is it is underway this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=146.2s)]
*  week and Peter we were talking you were talking about all the the tidal wave of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=151.2s)]
*  tech people who are going down to Mar-a-Lago and whatnot just just kind of a [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=156.29999999999998s)]
*  sign that so many people are going down to Palm Beach and it is during the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=161.1s)]
*  holiday season as well. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=165.1s)]
*  It is impossible to get a room for less than like five or six hundred bucks a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=166.6s)]
*  hotel room, right? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=170.9s)]
*  Yeah, if you drop a pin at Mar-a-Lago and look at stuff within like 15 or 20 [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=172.5s)]
*  miles you would be lucky any day of the week to get something for less than like [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=176.6s)]
*  six hundred bucks and these tech CEOs, you know, we hear a lot about the the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=180.8s)]
*  big names who are trying to get in front of Trump pretty much everybody that has [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=186.5s)]
*  is trying to be a guest of somebody at Mar-a-Lago just to shake his hand and be [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=192.2s)]
*  able to go and tell their their workers I talked to them we're gonna be fine for [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=197.7s)]
*  four years. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=202.5s)]
*  Well, how many bedrooms do you have? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=203.1s)]
*  Can we all stay at your house when we come for the inauguration? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  We can't get a hotel room. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=207.6s)]
*  Oh my house. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=209.7s)]
*  Yeah, we are there's a soft carpet in the basement. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=210.5s)]
*  It's brand-new carpet. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=215.7s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=216.7s)]
*  All right, Peter. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=217.89999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Peter. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=218.6s)]
*  Well, we do expect some of the cabinet members to be confirmed before, you know, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=219.2s)]
*  the process because the first the Congress gets seated January the 3rd. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=225.2s)]
*  So that's before the president is sworn in a Marco Rubio who already has [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=230.2s)]
*  bipartisan support knows probably will be confirmed by then. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  But I just been so surprised by the Democrats. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=237.6s)]
*  They have allowed Donald Trump to completely sweep the culture. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=240.1s)]
*  You got the union workers. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=244.0s)]
*  You got some of the people that were part of the Democratic coalition and now you [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=245.8s)]
*  got him at the Army-Navy game. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=249.8s)]
*  And although there were some Democrats there like Westmore who's a rise and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=252.9s)]
*  start governor of Maryland when it comes to the leadership of the Democratic [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=256.6s)]
*  Party, they just yielded to Donald Trump and all of his appointments and they [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=260.5s)]
*  just took over that arena. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=265.5s)]
*  Look at that the USA Cheers Navy wins 31 to 13. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=267.6s)]
*  Donald Trump was in the box. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=272.0s)]
*  Daniel Penny JD Vance. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=273.40000000000003s)]

*  Yeah, you know Donald Trump has attended each year of his presidency. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=281.5s)]
*  He also went in 2020 and you know, I don't think there has ever been such a [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx5mOHZ2yM&t=285.5s)]
