# Witness reveals shocking exchange with Israeli murder suspect: 'DID IT FOR GAZA'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I)
*  All right, let's bring in Katie Kalischer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=0.0s)]
*  She was inside the Capital Jewish Museum [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=2.04s)]
*  when those gunshots were ringing out, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=4.28s)]
*  and she actually was the one who took that video [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=6.2s)]
*  that we've been showing of the suspect being arrested [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=8.84s)]
*  and yelling, free Palestine. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=12.02s)]
*  Katie, thank you so much for sending us the video [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=13.88s)]
*  and coming on with us this morning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=15.88s)]
*  Sure, good morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=18.2s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  What was going through your head? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Describe what's happening here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=21.64s)]
*  So I was at the museum for this nice event, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  and suddenly we heard some gunshots [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  coming from outside the building, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=32.04s)]
*  maybe 10, 15 gunshots. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  And we didn't really understand what's going on, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=36.04s)]
*  but there was a man who came in, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=39.56s)]
*  and he's like saying, like, call the police, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=41.72s)]
*  and he's covered in rain, and he looks very distressed. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=44.84s)]
*  And so we're trying to offer him some help, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=48.78s)]
*  and even one of my friends asks him, like, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=55.08s)]
*  are you okay, can I get you some water? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=58.36s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, actually, that'd be great. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=60.92s)]
*  And I'm like, so, do you like this museum? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=64.16s)]
*  And he's like kind of playing dumb with me. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=68.44s)]
*  He's like, oh, what kind of museum is this? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=71.04s)]
*  And I'm like, it's a Jewish museum. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=73.08s)]
*  And he asks, do you think that's why they did it [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=75.82s)]
*  in reference to the gunshots we had heard? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=78.84s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, maybe, I don't know, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=81.92s)]
*  but I don't think so, I hope not. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  And that's when he reaches into his bag [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  and pulls out a keffiyeh and says to me, I did it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=92.44s)]
*  I did this for Gaza. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=96.05999999999999s)]
*  And then he starts shouting, free, free Palestine, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=97.83999999999999s)]
*  and the police show up and arrest him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  So, Katie, I wanna, I mean, what you just described. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=104.8s)]
*  You were talking to the suspect. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=109.44s)]
*  You were talking to the lynch killer right there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  Now that you know that he is the person, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=114.16s)]
*  he had just killed two people outside of it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=117.76s)]
*  You were standing right in front of him. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=120.12s)]
*  You could have easily been the next person. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=122.0s)]
*  Have you thought about that? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=125.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=128.6s)]
*  And what goes through your head? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=130.4s)]
*  I feel very lucky to be alive. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=133.72s)]
*  And I feel extremely sad for the victims, their families. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=136.6s)]
*  It could have been me. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=143.56s)]
*  Katie, Katie, can I ask you something? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=144.8s)]
*  When you looked at this guy, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=147.24s)]
*  did you see a deranged individual? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=148.36s)]
*  I mean, how do you shoot somebody [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=150.68s)]
*  and be that calm afterwards? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=152.44s)]
*  What did you see when you looked at him? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=155.56s)]
*  He wasn't calm. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=157.24s)]
*  He looked very scared, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=158.84s)]
*  but I thought it was because he had just witnessed a murder. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=160.12s)]
*  I didn't think for a second he was actually the murderer. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=164.4s)]
*  Wow, and then he said, he admitted it to you, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=169.24s)]
*  which means you'll probably be called into court [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  and you'll have to testify about this, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=174.12s)]
*  because it sounds like he said, I did it, I did it, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=175.5s)]
*  I did it for, did he say Hamas or did he say Gaza? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=177.82s)]
*  I did it for Gaza. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=181.34s)]
*  For Gaza. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=182.46s)]
*  Real quickly, Katie, before we let you go, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=183.82s)]
*  can you explain what happened after he confessed to you guys? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=186.22s)]
*  How long did it take for authorities to get there? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=190.94s)]
*  What happened in the facility? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=194.18s)]
*  Were there guards already there to take him away? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=195.7s)]
*  Or were you just in his mercy at that moment? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=199.3s)]
*  There were guards that had actually let him [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=202.96s)]
*  into the building, which seems like a bad idea now [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=207.08s)]
*  in retrospect, but I think that they were just coming [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=211.96s)]
*  from a place of humanity and thinking that, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  oh, this person was out in the street [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=216.68s)]
*  when these gunshots were happening, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=219.38s)]
*  let's keep him safe also. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=220.76s)]
*  Katie, what was happening? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  They moved us all into an area [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=224.0s)]
*  and were trying to keep us safe. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=226.52s)]
*  How long did y'all have to stay? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=228.8s)]
*  I was standing that we were in the room [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=230.36s)]
*  for 10 whole minutes with the murderer. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  And then, oh, he was put in that room with y'all? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=235.68s)]
*  Yes, we were all in the room together. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  And he had a gun on him? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=241.0s)]
*  I'm not sure if he had the gun on him still at that moment [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=243.32000000000002s)]
*  or if he left it outside. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=247.34s)]
*  Gosh, when you left, sorry, Ryan, go ahead. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  I was just saying, Katie, so when you're looking at him, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=253.28000000000003s)]
*  someone's been shot, did you hear any gunshot noises? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=255.68s)]
*  Where are the bodies of the couple? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=258.96s)]
*  And you said 10 minutes, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=261.96s)]
*  and there was no ambulance in 10 minutes? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=263.44s)]
*  And there was no police for 10 minutes? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=265.76s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  So you were seated in for 10 minutes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=277.4s)]
*  Did you know that there were bodies outside? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=280.0s)]
*  I didn't understand what was going on. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  In fact, I really didn't get it [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=285.64s)]
*  that he was a murderer until I had spoken to the police. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=289.56s)]
*  I thought that when you go to these Jewish events [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=294.08s)]
*  or pro-Israel events of any kind, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=296.92s)]
*  there's often protesters that are gonna be harassing us. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=299.28s)]
*  So I thought that this, I actually thought the gunshots [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=305.4s)]
*  and this protester guy were separate. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=309.36s)]
*  So Katie, you've had some time to reflect now [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=313.0s)]
*  that this has happened. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=316.52s)]
*  You were right there in front of the killer. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=317.36s)]
*  And you've been going to these pro-Israeli, I think, events, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=320.76s)]
*  and you've seen the counter protesters. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=324.48s)]
*  You speak about the chanting that's been going on there. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=326.2s)]
*  What do you think about the state of America [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=329.68s)]
*  now that this is allowed? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=332.6s)]
*  This is a clear escalation. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=333.6s)]
*  We have the killing now of two Israelis. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  Do you feel safe? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=338.8s)]
*  Do you think more needs to be done? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=340.0s)]
*  I think that antisemitism is out of control in this country. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=343.04s)]
*  This is not the first time [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=348.44s)]
*  that I've been victim to an antisemitic attack. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=349.6s)]
*  I'm actually lesbian and I go to a lot of nightclubs in DC [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  and in fact, the LGBT community [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=357.64000000000004s)]
*  has been quite unwelcoming to me as a Jewish person. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  I've been asked to leave the clubs [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvUo22Sy1I&t=363.24s)]
