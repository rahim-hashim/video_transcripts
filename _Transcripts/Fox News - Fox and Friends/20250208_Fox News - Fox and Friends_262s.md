# JB Pritzker has a long history of not following the law: Chicago attorney
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0)
*  Illinois Governor JB Pritzker calling President Trump's lawsuit against the state in the city of Chicago a massive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=0.0s)]
*  Distraction after the DOJ claimed state and city officials interfered with deportation efforts against criminal migrants [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=6.72s)]
*  Unlike Donald Trump we follow the law in Illinois [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=14.68s)]
*  This administration is opaque not transparent at all and they want you to pay attention to a bunch of lawsuits that are about something [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=18.16s)]
*  That frankly is unlawful [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=24.92s)]
*  I think it's a massive effort to distract from what they are doing across the country to take away things that working-class [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=26.92s)]
*  middle-class [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=34.6s)]
*  People families the most vulnerable really need [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=36.28s)]
*  Okay. Well Chicago attorney and Northwestern adjunct law professor Andrew Stolman joins us now to sort this out Andrew. Good morning [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=40.32s)]
*  Thank you for taking time. Let me just for our viewers read a little bit of the DOJ's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=47.72s)]
*  Lawsuit suing Illinois and the city of Chicago over the sanctuary laws [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  They say this the conduct of officials in Chicago and Illinois minimally enforcing and oftentimes [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=56.959999999999994s)]
*  Affirmatively thwarting federal immigration laws over a period of years has resulted in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=63.08s)]
*  Countless criminals being released into Chicago who should have been held for immigration removal from the United States [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  Andrew you be the judge. Where does this stand from a legal? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=75.84s)]
*  standpoint [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=80.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's gonna be a really really solid lawsuit and this is something that's been going on by both JB Pritzker [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=81.64s)]
*  And our mayor for a very very long time and Griff. It's unfortunate that it has come to this because it's constitutional law 101 [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  There's something called the supremacy clause in the United States Constitution [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=95.0s)]
*  If you have federal law and state law that interfere with one another federal law takes precedent and JB Pritzker doesn't get it [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=98.56s)]
*  Johnson doesn't get it [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=105.32s)]
*  And so I think Trump had to basically file this lawsuit or at least DOJ to try to light a fire under their rear end to tell [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=106.86s)]
*  Them guess what you cannot interfere with federal law when it comes to immigration [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=113.96s)]
*  Well, and you know Andrew from the standpoint and and and governor Pritzker and mayor Johnson have both tried to claim [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=118.88s)]
*  Well, we of course support law enforcement when they're going after [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=126.08s)]
*  criminal federal cases [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=131.16s)]
*  We want to support them but yet here you have the state in the city not cooperating with ice [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=133.16s)]
*  That wouldn't have to go into these communities had the local districts [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=139.64s)]
*  Cooperated to put the entire public safety on a better footing [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=145.4s)]
*  Yeah, typical politician double-speak. I mean we all know that every single illegal immigrant in this country is breaking the law [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=150.24s)]
*  So, you know some of Jamie Pritzker kind of thinks it's like a menu at a restaurant where you can pick and choose [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=158.24s)]
*  I'll take these two appetizers a couple dessert and one main course when it comes to the law [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=163.98s)]
*  You have to follow all the law and unfortunately Jamie Pritzker has a long history of not [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=168.3s)]
*  Following the law here in this great city and great state of ours here in Chicago, Illinois [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=173.28s)]
*  And I think that's why this federal lawsuit by the DOJ was so necessary to make him do what he is required to do [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=177.56s)]
*  Which is simple follow the law and help bring in these violent gang members and others convicted of crimes [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=184.54s)]
*  heinous crimes [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=192.98s)]
*  There's one other piece of this I want to get to Andrew and that is Attorney General Pam Bondi is now [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=193.89999999999998s)]
*  Considering withholding funding to sanctuary cities like Chicago. Do you see that as possibly having some teeth? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=200.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. What better way to get politicians to follow the law than withhold money [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  Which they so desperately need and it's unfortunate that it has to come to this [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=212.22s)]
*  It's almost like this election didn't take place what three four months ago that they forgot that the will of the people is to get [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=216.33999999999997s)]
*  Rid of these illegal [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=223.14s)]
*  Immigrants who are in this country who are committing these crimes who are doing all these horrific things and unfortunately [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=224.77999999999997s)]
*  Now it's gonna have to be where you withhold money from the city to get them to do what legally they're required to do [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=230.06s)]
*  And then finally there is the ballot box [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  We'll see how Illinois and Chicago voters feel about their leaders not supporting the effort to get [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=239.34s)]
*  Violent criminals off the street who are here illegally Andrew Stolman as always. Thank you for your insight and time [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cksnIscE0&t=246.06s)]
