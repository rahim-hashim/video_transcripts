# Kamala Harris is running as a ‘victim girl boss’: Rachel Campos-Duffy
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0)
*  Can I tell you guys, I just am not, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=0.0s)]
*  it's not just Kamala, like the whole idea that [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=2.92s)]
*  as a woman I should be excited about a woman [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=5.64s)]
*  just because it's a woman to be a president, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=9.4s)]
*  it just does not appeal to me. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=11.28s)]
*  Like I, maybe I'm unique in that way, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=12.88s)]
*  but it's like I just want who's the best for the country [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=15.32s)]
*  and I hate those sort of appeals like that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=19.04s)]
*  It just doesn't work. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=21.88s)]
*  Obviously it works on some people, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=22.96s)]
*  this idea of breaking the glass ceiling. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  It's also not that inspiring that it's her [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=26.8s)]
*  because she's just not been very good [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  and not been, doesn't seem ready for it, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=30.88s)]
*  but anyway, I just saw that clip of Lizzo [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=33.82s)]
*  and it just came to my mind. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=36.68s)]
*  I'm like, it doesn't work for me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=37.76s)]
*  She's also running as a victim. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=39.28s)]
*  She's always trying to be a victim of something. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=41.0s)]
*  Like, you're interrupting me, let me finish. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=43.12s)]
*  It's like this whole victim mentality and I don't. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  You know what's interesting about that? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=49.28s)]
*  Victim girl boss. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  Somebody said, somebody pointed this out, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=50.96s)]
*  like the difference between the two campaigns right now [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=53.78s)]
*  is one feels like it's constantly on defense [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=57.3s)]
*  and one feels like it's on offense. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=59.14s)]
*  And defensiveness is sort of key to the nature of victimhood. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=60.54s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=65.25999999999999s)]
*  And so I don't know if that's an indication [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=66.1s)]
*  of how they feel like their own campaigns are going. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=68.62s)]
*  We're getting other indications down ballot ads [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=69.97999999999999s)]
*  that with Democrats tying themselves to Donald Trump [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=72.1s)]
*  or whatever it may be, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=74.34s)]
*  but defensiveness doesn't seem to be optimism. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=75.17999999999999s)]
*  Fun campaigns are winning campaigns [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=79.82s)]
*  and the other adages, if you're explaining, you're losing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=82.17999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun that he's going to McDonald's. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=86.3s)]
*  I know I can't stop talking about it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  I think that's fun. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=90.62s)]
*  All right, so Lara Trump was on just earlier [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=92.1s)]
*  and she was speaking about indicators in a campaign. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=94.38s)]
*  You know, Republicans have always been behind the ball [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=98.1s)]
*  when it comes to early voting, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  because most Republicans, most conservatives [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=101.28s)]
*  like the idea of same day, paper ballots. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=103.5s)]
*  They like the old fashioned way of voting, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=106.42s)]
*  but they've had to adjust. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=108.66s)]
*  And Lara Trump and others like Scott Pressler [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=110.78s)]
*  have been part of changing the mindset [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=113.14s)]
*  within the party and now Lara Trump says, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=115.64s)]
*  watch out, North Carolina has record early voter turnout. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=118.68s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=123.0s)]
*  We have seen early vote totals there [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=124.68s)]
*  that are outpacing Democrats, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=126.64s)]
*  meaning the first two days of early voting, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=128.28s)]
*  which was Thursday and Friday, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=130.48s)]
*  Republicans had a thousand more votes than Democrats [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=132.1s)]
*  coming out of those two days. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=136.32s)]
*  We never see that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=137.58s)]
*  It's usually like an 80-20 split in the Democrats' favor. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=138.64s)]
*  So we're seeing that people have heard our rallying cry [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=141.96s)]
*  to get out and vote early. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=144.8s)]
*  And why this is important [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  is because we want you to bank your vote. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=148.0s)]
*  We don't want you to have to worry [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=149.56s)]
*  about waiting in super long lines on election day. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=150.8s)]
*  And it allows us as the party and as the campaign [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=153.56s)]
*  to then apply our resources [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=156.24s)]
*  to turn out low propensity voters [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=158.18s)]
*  who may not vote every election cycle. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=159.9s)]
*  That's how we win this thing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=162.36s)]
*  And what we've seen is it's been massive. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, you asked about whether or not, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=166.10000000000002s)]
*  whether they were prepared with the early voting [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=169.0s)]
*  in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, obviously Asheville [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=173.76s)]
*  has gotten a lot of attention as it should get, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=175.72s)]
*  but there are a lot of areas, you know, sprawling areas [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=178.24s)]
*  of Western North Carolina, far outside of Asheville, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=182.04s)]
*  that hopefully Republicans are also being very attentive [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=184.94s)]
*  about getting those people to vote as well, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  because, you know, the devastation goes [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=192.36s)]
*  for hundreds of miles. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=194.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP0b1TRvpQ0&t=195.96s)]
