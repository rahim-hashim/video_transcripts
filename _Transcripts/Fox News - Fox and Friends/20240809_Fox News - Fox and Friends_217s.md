# Netanyahu is in Iran's head now: Gen. Jack Keane
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc)
*  Let's bring a retired four-star general Jack Keane general I thought by now we'd be talking about the retaliation of Iran and or Hezbollah [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=0.0s)]
*  Why haven't we? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=7.96s)]
*  Well, first of all, you know [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=11.64s)]
*  They took about two weeks the last time and and they're doing much the same this time [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=13.4s)]
*  And I think they're near I was really inside the head now of the Iranian leadership [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=17.84s)]
*  I mean when he when he killed Hamas's political chief [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=23.56s)]
*  That was one thing the location of it. It was actually more important [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=28.419999999999998s)]
*  because the location was in a high security area in the general vicinity of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=32.86s)]
*  Where many of the elite leaders of Iran have taken up residence that means this is their primary [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=37.66s)]
*  security zone area by the security services and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=44.62s)]
*  Netanyahu penetrated that and he had to have help to do that likely from an Iranian resistance group [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=48.94s)]
*  That message has been sent to the leaders and what Netanyahu is saying [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=55.66s)]
*  You come in here and you hurt my civilian population here [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=60.9s)]
*  I'm gonna come back for you and that has got to be inside their head and what he's doing in Gaza [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=64.9s)]
*  He's got his foot on the gas pedal here [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=71.78s)]
*  He is telling Hamas Hezbollah and the Iranian leadership that I'm gonna finish this on my terms [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=74.34s)]
*  And he is completely committed to it [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=81.38000000000001s)]
*  I wish the administration was as committed as he is to the end state of this war [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=83.38000000000001s)]
*  He knows he's got to finish off these thousands of fighters if he leaves them in place as a result of a permanent ceasefire [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=88.66000000000001s)]
*  Hamas wins and they just bide their time before they reattach [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=96.78s)]
*  So we know that our fighter jets arrived right there in the Middle East [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=101.38000000000001s)]
*  What's that symbolic of and number two is are we ever gonna answer for the attack at our base in Iraq? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=104.18s)]
*  Well, you would have thought we would have answered by now [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=111.86000000000001s)]
*  But after all we're wringing our hands about not wanting to escalate [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=114.5s)]
*  But did they escalate? Of course they did and and that's where we have been [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=120.30000000000001s)]
*  much more on defense than we should be on offense and hands off Iran in terms of US direct attacks for sure despite all of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=124.98s)]
*  The requests being made by our military commanders likely not to not to happen here [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=132.74s)]
*  But look at credit the administration here [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  We have got a very effective commander in charge of the US led coalition general Corilla and they have given him [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=140.98s)]
*  Additional resources to make certain that we're able to intercept as much as possible [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=148.34s)]
*  The Iranian attack by drones as well as missiles [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  So the f-22 that's a major interceptor for the US the Brits the French will likely be flying as well the Jordanians [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=157.18s)]
*  All of that coordinated by General Corrillas headquarters and also naval war combat ships with major [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=164.73999999999998s)]
*  Interceptors on them have been added to the fro here [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=171.78s)]
*  So the US led coalition will clearly play a role in Iran's retaliation attack depending on the scale of it certainly [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=174.57999999999998s)]
*  General of people should understand how this ends has everything to do with if it starts up again [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=184.29999999999998s)]
*  Everybody wants to hostages out [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=190.32s)]
*  But if you leave Hamas intact it's only going to be worse the next time and if you read the Institute for the study of war [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=191.92s)]
*  That you put out every day it reveals what is really going on general. Thanks so much. Have a great weekend [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnzWvBfDZc&t=198.23999999999998s)]
