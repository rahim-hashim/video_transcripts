# Kayleigh McEnany: 'This is quite extraordinary'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok)
*  A federal judge will hear arguments today after 14 states asked to block Elon Musk's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=0.0s)]
*  doge from accessing federal data. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=5.48s)]
*  Now, it's one of the latest attempts from Democrats to fight President Trump's agenda [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=8.08s)]
*  in court. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  We're winning in court. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=14.68s)]
*  More than a dozen federal injunctions and temporary restraining orders have been issued [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=16.1s)]
*  against everything from their illegal seizure of computer data and every American's private [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=21.04s)]
*  data at the Treasury Department to their illegal attempt to ban birthright citizenship. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=26.98s)]
*  Number one, you know the Constitution. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=33.3s)]
*  You know they can't just freeze these funds. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=35.82s)]
*  And we're going to continue to work together in an all hands on deck effort to push back [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=37.54s)]
*  against the far right extremism that is being unleashed on this country. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=43.18s)]
*  Well, who better to talk to than Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett, who joins me now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=48.86s)]
*  Greg, I want to read to you a passage I found from New Mexico versus Elon Musk. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=55.18s)]
*  And it's quite extraordinary in the hyperbole. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=60.14s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=62.78s)]
*  Although our constitutional system was designed to prevent the abuses of an 18th century monarch, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=63.78s)]
*  the instruments of unchecked power are no less dangerous in the hands of a 21st century [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=69.82s)]
*  tech baron. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=76.1s)]
*  So they're comparing this to British colonialism. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=77.7s)]
*  You know, the meltdown, as Steve described it, Kayleigh, is amusing because presidents [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=83.14s)]
*  have broad authority under Article 2 of the Constitution to govern and control agencies [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=89.38s)]
*  and departments in the executive branch. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=94.69999999999999s)]
*  How much money is spent hiring, firing, auditing for fraud, waste and abuse. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=97.83999999999999s)]
*  So Trump is exercising a core responsibility serving the public's interest. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=103.66s)]
*  That's his solemn duty. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=109.58s)]
*  The legal question becomes, can he delegate that power to Musk and Doge? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=111.9s)]
*  Democrats who have sued say, oh, you can't do that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=118.02000000000001s)]
*  He wasn't Senate confirmed under the appointments clause. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=120.42s)]
*  That's nonsense. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=124.9s)]
*  There's a large body of law that says the president absolutely can, on his own, without [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=125.9s)]
*  the Senate, confer administrative powers to others like Doge. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=131.58s)]
*  So these early setbacks in various lower courts, that was expected. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  Trump knew that, you know, liberals would go running and crying to favorable judges. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=141.29999999999998s)]
*  Oh, gee whiz, he's stopping our fraud and waste. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=146.38s)]
*  We want that to continue. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=149.45999999999998s)]
*  Ultimately, I think the Supreme Court will weigh in and that's where Trump will prevail [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=151.34s)]
*  the laws on his side. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  So you believe that if it does make it to the Supreme Court, you know, conservative, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=158.82s)]
*  originalist judges like Thomas Alito will say nonsense. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=162.7s)]
*  That's not the way the appointments clause works. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=166.54s)]
*  No need to get congressional approval for Doge. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=168.2s)]
*  Yeah, the laws on their side. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=171.89999999999998s)]
*  Plus, when you're serving in the public interest and the public is in favor of it, I mean, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=174.1s)]
*  that's something that I think the Supreme Court recognizes. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=179.5s)]
*  Steve mentioned it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=182.7s)]
*  A CVS poll found 70 percent agree that the president is doing what he promised. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=183.98s)]
*  A majority approve of it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=188.7s)]
*  It was a key part of his mandate. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=190.29999999999998s)]
*  Democrats here are picking the wrong battle. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=192.85999999999999s)]
*  What person in their right mind wants to continue billions of taxpayer dollars squandered on [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=195.66s)]
*  waste and fraud, but they are so reflexively against anything that Trump does, their lawsuits [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=202.38s)]
*  make them look like they favor financial abuse. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=210.22s)]
*  What Doge and Musk have uncovered so far is really shocking Americans. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=214.78s)]
*  70 percent of government spending is wasted billions in misplaced funds. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=220.10000000000002s)]
*  Americans, I think, are fed up with this and Trump is moving in their direction. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=226.5s)]
*  I assume the Supreme Court, I think, is not oblivious to that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  So speaking of the Supreme Court, we finally have the first case that they will hear. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=235.78s)]
*  This happened overnight. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=239.86s)]
*  And here's what happened. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  So Trump is asking the Supreme Court to allow him to fire this independent agency leader. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=242.34s)]
*  He's at the office of the special counsel. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=247.06s)]
*  His name is Hampton Dellinger. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=249.38s)]
*  And the argument from the Solicitor General is this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=252.1s)]
*  Until now, as far as we are aware, no court in American history has wielded an injunction [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  to force the president to retain an agency head. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  Are you bullish on his prospects with SCOTUS on this one? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=263.38s)]
*  Again, the law is on the president's side. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=268.98s)]
*  Dellinger is a political appointee by Joe Biden. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=271.22s)]
*  I'll compare it to U.S. attorneys, political appointees. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=274.42s)]
*  They can be fired by the incoming president. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  They don't have civil service protections, which, by the way, have a myriad of exceptions [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=280.58s)]
*  associated with them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=287.62s)]
*  Look, our federal bureaucracy, Kayleigh, is the definition of bloated. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=288.82s)]
*  Isn't it about time that a president had the courage to put the government on an ozempic diet? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=293.86s)]
*  There are too many inept bureaucrats doing too little. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=299.62s)]
*  It's excessive. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=303.3s)]
*  It's inefficient. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=304.1s)]
*  No business could run that way. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  In cutting, for example, last Friday, 400 DHS workers, my goodness, that's a saving [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=308.42s)]
*  of $50 million. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=314.58s)]
*  In trimming all these other swollen agencies, that's going to save billions of dollars. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=316.98s)]
*  Legally, Trump has immense authority to do this. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=322.42s)]
*  Putting the government on an ozempic diet, that may be the quote of the day. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=327.38s)]
*  That may be the quote of the day. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=330.98s)]
*  Greg Jared, I like that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNQtPlg84ok&t=332.74s)]
