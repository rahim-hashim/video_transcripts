# Israel intercepts ballistic missile fired from Yemen
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM)
*  Trey Yanks is live on the ground in southern Israel with the very latest. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=0.0s)]
*  Trey, good morning to you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=4.0s)]
*  Good afternoon there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Day 25. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=7.24s)]
*  What's the latest? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=8.24s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=9.24s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=10.24s)]
*  Some significant breaking news right now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=11.24s)]
*  The Israeli military says that the arrow missile defense system has intercepted a surface-to-surface [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=14.52s)]
*  missile that was likely fired from Yemen. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=21.12s)]
*  This is a significant development, and the first time since this war began, that the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=24.26s)]
*  arrow defense system was used. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=28.08s)]
*  Now, they say this was a successful interception, likely a ballistic missile fired by Houthi [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=30.28s)]
*  rebels in Yemen, a group backed by the Iranian regime. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=34.96s)]
*  The Israelis also saying that two cruise missiles were fired at Israel and that fighter jets [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=38.56s)]
*  were scrambled to shoot them down. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=43.2s)]
*  This may be an update to what we reported last hour. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=45.28s)]
*  What initially was thought to be drones that were launched and traveled over the Red Sea [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=48.04s)]
*  may have been cruise missiles along with one ballistic missile. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=52.96s)]
*  I do want to step out of the frame here and show you the scene behind me. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=56.16s)]
*  The Israelis say there is currently heavy fighting ongoing inside the Gaza Strip as [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=59.76s)]
*  those infantry troops continue to push deeper into Gaza. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=65.0s)]
*  This morning I did meet with the country's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who spoke [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=69.2s)]
*  about the situation inside. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  We are still waiting to get that information on the record to share with you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  All we've been able to get approved right now is that there are heavy battles ongoing [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=78.84s)]
*  inside the strip between Hamas militants from the Al Qassam Brigades and the Israeli military [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=82.92s)]
*  that is operating at this hour. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=88.36s)]
*  We do know the number of hostages, though, has risen to 240 people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=90.64s)]
*  That does not include the five that are back safely in Israel. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  That's two American citizens, two Israeli citizens, and that soldier that was rescued [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=99.32s)]
*  yesterday by the Israeli military during a raid that was conducted with intelligence [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=103.24s)]
*  by the Israeli Shin Bet. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=108.16s)]
*  That soldier we're talking about is Private Ori Megadish, who was freed during the operation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  She was originally taken on October 7th from the Nakhlos base that sits along the Gaza [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=115.56s)]
*  border. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=120.0s)]
*  You saw that picture with her family. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=121.0s)]
*  They look just totally relieved to have their daughter back in safe hands after so many [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=122.16s)]
*  weeks in Hamas captivity. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=128.32s)]
*  We're also getting new video today from the Israelis of a strike against a top Hamas commander [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=130.44s)]
*  inside Gaza, that commander, Nassim Abu Ajina, who reportedly directed one of the attacks [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=135.52s)]
*  on the border communities on October 7th. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=141.32000000000002s)]
*  So a lot of activity taking place along the Gaza strip behind me, and the Israelis do [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=143.88s)]
*  say they are currently engaged in heavy battles at this hour. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=148.08s)]
*  Guys? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=151.44s)]
*  You know, Trey, there's just no doubt about it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=152.44s)]
*  If a rocket's coming from Syria, Tezbo is sponsored by Iran, Hamas sponsored by Iran, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=154.24s)]
*  and then the Houthi rebels would not exist without Iran. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=160.08s)]
*  This is Iran over and over again. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=163.5s)]
*  How soon to this expands directly to that, to Tehran? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=166.66s)]
*  To Tehran? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=170.74s)]
*  Look, it's a great question because the threats that Israel faces right now are coming from [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=171.74s)]
*  Iranian proxies. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=178.5s)]
*  Houthi rebels are not making surface to surface missiles themselves. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=180.14s)]
*  They're receiving them from the Iranian regime. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=183.9s)]
*  Hezbollah is not making precision guided munitions themselves. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=186.26s)]
*  They're being smuggled in through Syria and given to this militant organization in southern [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=189.56s)]
*  Lebanon originating in Tehran, in Iran. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=194.52s)]
*  And so the question here is, when will the Israelis start expanding their response against [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=198.48s)]
*  Iran itself and its proxies across the region? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=203.86s)]
*  You're already starting to see the Israelis strike deeper into Lebanon, and we can't expect [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  some level of response following this attempted ballistic missile and cruise missile attack [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=211.32s)]
*  earlier today. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=215.72s)]
*  All right, Trey Yngst, Southern Israel. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=217.28s)]
*  Trey, thank you very much. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=219.48s)]
*  Be careful. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=220.48s)]
*  And the air defense system has not been used until today. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=221.48s)]
*  So this is incredible. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=225.1s)]
*  So they are being struck from Yemen, from Lebanon, and from Gaza? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=226.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=230.64s)]
*  In every direction. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=231.64s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e10YMvNfFBM&t=232.64s)]
