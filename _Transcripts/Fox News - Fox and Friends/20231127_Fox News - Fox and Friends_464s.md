# Israel raises concern with list of Hamas hostages: Report
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws)
*  Good morning everybody. It is Monday November 27 2023 and we begin this hour of Fox and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=0.0s)]
*  Friends with a Fox News alert. It is 6 a.m. here in New York City. It's one o'clock in [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=7.24s)]
*  the afternoon in Israel and we are now in the fourth and final day of the temporary [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=12.64s)]
*  four day ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. So we're learning that both have concerns [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=17.72s)]
*  over the list of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners due to be released today, Anzalita. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=24.34s)]
*  This after 14 more Israeli hostages were freed yesterday, bringing the total number [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=29.8s)]
*  now to 40 over the last three days. But how many more? Trey Yanks is live at the Snyders [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=35.4s)]
*  Children's Medical Center in Israel. Trey, what's behind you? What's inside that building? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=40.96s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys, good morning. Overnight for the third straight evening a group of hostages [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=46.16s)]
*  was released from Gaza. Nine of them children that were flown here by helicopter to the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=52.8s)]
*  Snyders Children's Hospital just outside of Tel Aviv. Additionally, two mothers flown [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=58.28s)]
*  here as well. We spoke with the grandmother who had three of her grandchildren here released [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  last night from Gaza and she said the kids were just being kids. They were laughing and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=68.18s)]
*  playing. They wanted to eat pizza and we know among that group, four year old Abigail [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=72.38s)]
*  Idan, an American Israeli citizen. Both of her parents were tragically killed, but she [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=77.04s)]
*  did become a symbol of survival and hope, a reminder also of the brutality Hamas inflicted [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=82.0s)]
*  on the civilian population. Yesterday, President Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=87.62s)]
*  Netanyahu about the release of Abigail. He had this to say. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=92.14s)]
*  The little girl Abigail, what a joy to see her with us. But on the other hand, what a [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=97.14s)]
*  pain that she returns to the reality of no parents. She has no parents, but she has a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=106.58000000000001s)]
*  whole nation that embraces her. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=112.06s)]
*  There are so many families struggling today with the aftermath of what took place on October [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=117.42s)]
*  7th, but loved ones meeting their family members at this hospital just trying to hold on to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=122.42s)]
*  hope as this war continues. There are questions today in the last day of the ceasefire about [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  if it will be extended. Regional sources telling Fox News they do believe they will be able [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=132.84s)]
*  to get some sort of agreement between Israel and Hamas to get additional hostages out for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=137.48s)]
*  more pauses in fighting. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=142.46s)]
*  I thought it was hardcore. Give us 10 for each day. You give me 10 and we get a day [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=144.62s)]
*  extension. Is there some gray area? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=150.06s)]
*  It appears that will be exactly it. It has to go with the initial agreement that was [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=154.94s)]
*  brokered by the Qataris, and that is laid out 10 hostages for each additional day. We [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=159.56s)]
*  should talk about the caveat here, though, and the challenge for Hamas. Hamas does not [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=164.86s)]
*  know where all of the hostages are because there were other organizations inside Gaza [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=170.62s)]
*  that brutally kidnapped people on October 7th, including Islamic Jihad, PFLP, some of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=174.46s)]
*  these smaller factions and also criminal families in Gaza. And so hostages are spread throughout [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=179.18s)]
*  the strip. It will be incredibly difficult for Hamas to identify and locate all of them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=184.38s)]
*  And so we may be looking at a few days here of an additional extension to this ceasefire. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=189.38s)]
*  But after that, the Israelis say they are pushing forward with their operation inside [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=194.18s)]
*  Gaza to destroy Hamas leadership. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=198.42s)]
*  That's right. And true, of course, we want all the hostages back. But apparently Israel's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=200.78s)]
*  got a problem with the list of hostages. But Hamas has a problem, according to Reuters, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=205.61999999999998s)]
*  with the list as well. So what's the problem? Who gets to write the list of which bad guys [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=212.5s)]
*  we let out? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=219.14s)]
*  Yeah, there are a lot of technical details here, and we should talk about the exchange, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=221.14s)]
*  taking place and also the list. Right now there's an issue with the list because the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=226.5s)]
*  Israelis were promised that all mothers and children would be released together. Last [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=231.26000000000002s)]
*  night that didn't happen. There were some children that came back to Israel without [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=236.26000000000002s)]
*  their mothers. Additionally, Hamas is pushing to get more of their prisoners released. And [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=239.68s)]
*  we're not talking about people that were just simply taken to jail for no reason. Yesterday, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=245.58s)]
*  a woman who tried to commit a bombing attack against Israel was released as part of this [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  deal in exchange for some of the children that are being treated here at this hospital. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=254.98000000000002s)]
*  And it just gives you a sense of the exchange, what's taking place, hostages for prisoners. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=259.1s)]
*  And we do expect that to continue tonight. Additional hostages will be released if this [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=263.94s)]
*  deal moves forward on the fourth day. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=268.18s)]
*  So Trey, are the Americans, I mean, you know Hamas, are they worth more, which is why the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=270.1s)]
*  Hamas is holding on to many of the Americans? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=276.46s)]
*  It's tough to tell how Hamas prioritizes the hostages, but we can infer based on the understanding [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=283.62s)]
*  we have from talking to the group and also from the hostages that they've released so [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=288.86s)]
*  far that they understand the symbolism behind some of these hostages. For example, there's [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=293.04s)]
*  a 10-month-old baby and we spoke with one of his relatives yesterday in Tel Aviv at [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=297.62s)]
*  Hostage Square and he has largely become a symbol of hope for the Israeli people, but [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=301.74s)]
*  he's not yet been on this initial list. So Israeli officials are hoping he could be released [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=306.46s)]
*  today, but there's no clear indication yet if he'll be on that list along with his brother, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=312.02s)]
*  who was also taken hostage into Gaza. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=315.58s)]
*  Now the Israelis continue to see the aftermath of this brutal massacre that took place more [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=317.9s)]
*  than 50 days ago. Just last hour, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Kafar [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=322.38s)]
*  Aza, one of the communities along the Gaza border, and he was joined by Elon Musk. Once [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=327.94s)]
*  again, the Israelis trying to show the world, the international community, the brutality [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=332.7s)]
*  that Hamas inflicted on the civilian population here, trying to remind people, especially [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=337.34s)]
*  high-profile visitors to Israel, about what took place and who Hamas was targeting. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=341.78s)]
*  Trey, we're seeing some of these images of the freed hostages. We were also just blown [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=346.78s)]
*  away by that beautiful video of the little 9-year-old boy running down the hallways of [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=353.78s)]
*  the hospital where you are right now at the Schneider Children's Hospital into the arms [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=357.53999999999996s)]
*  of his dad. What are the hostages telling you, are their families telling you about [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=361.38s)]
*  the little boy? He's 9 years old. How they all were treated? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=366.78s)]
*  It's a great question. That little boy, Ohad, 9 years old, he celebrated his birthday while [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=374.02s)]
*  he was held by Hamas inside Gaza in late October, but he has also become just such a symbol [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=378.74s)]
*  for this country. He was reunited and one of the first things that he did was go and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=385.14s)]
*  have mashed potatoes and schnitzel, fried chicken. A classic dish here. You hear this [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=390.18s)]
*  from so many of the family members. The grandmother that we just spoke with last hour, she said [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=395.74s)]
*  the kids wanted pizza and they wanted iPads. She was sort of joking about how they had [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=400.06s)]
*  been in Gaza for so long, but they're just kids. They want to have snacks and they want [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=404.34000000000003s)]
*  to play with their friends. Ohad, actually, when he came to Schneider's Children's Hospital, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=409.22s)]
*  he was reunited with his friends. You saw images of them eating ice cream. It really [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=414.38s)]
*  just sort of cuts through all of the noise in this story. This is a story about humans [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=419.14s)]
*  and about people and so many families are waiting, hoping that their loved ones will [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=424.8s)]
*  be on the next list of hostages that are released from Gaza. Let's hope. Real quickly, what [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=429.92s)]
*  are the ducks behind you? Do those represent anything with the hostages? It's just decoration [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=434.92s)]
*  for the hospital and this hospital actually has a giant fish tank too for the kids. There [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=441.36s)]
*  you go. All right. Trey, thank you very much. It's good to see you with that bulletproof [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  vest. I know, a helmet. And a helmet indeed. Thanks, Trey. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNSVowjhws&t=449.28s)]
