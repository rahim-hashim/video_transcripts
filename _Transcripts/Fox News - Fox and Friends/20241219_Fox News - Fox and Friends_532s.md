# Republicans sound OFF on massive spending bill: 'This is a s--- sandwich!'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA)
*  It's a Fox News alert. The government shutdown for the federal government. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=0.0s)]
*  The deadline is quickly approaching as president elect Trump and Doge leaders [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=3.4s)]
*  are rallying Republicans against that 1500 page spending bill that had lots of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=7.44s)]
*  pork. Elon Musk says Peter Doocy is live in Washington with the latest for us. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=13.86s)]
*  Hey, Peter. Good morning. The odds of a government shutdown are now as high as [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  60 40 or 70 30. According to our Capitol Hill whisperer Chad program, after the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  original spending bill completely fell apart. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=29.8s)]
*  This is a sandwich. I don't know how to say that we're being forced into this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=34.88s)]
*  position. They could have done a standalone. They did this because they [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=38.2s)]
*  knew that it would put members in this position to support it. We're damned if [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=40.92s)]
*  we do. We're damned if we don't. The final nail in the coffin was on truth [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=43.8s)]
*  social where Donald Trump posted. Sounds like the ridiculous and extraordinarily [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=47.74s)]
*  expensive continuing resolution plus is dying fast. One of the most unpopular [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=52.6s)]
*  parts was the raise for lawmakers. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=58.4s)]
*  Members are giving themselves a pay raise. Do you guys deserve a pay raise? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=62.72s)]
*  Well, that's news to me. It's good news. People look at the performance of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=67.16s)]
*  Congress, say, Why should we give them money? What about the media? Think about [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=71.36s)]
*  that for a second. We're not paid by public money. I know you're not, but I [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  mean, half of your listeners are not there anymore. You're still getting the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=78.08s)]
*  same paycheck. What's going on? When the top house dem, Hakeem Jeffries, posted [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  on X House Republicans have been ordered to shut down the government and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=86.06s)]
*  hurt the working class Americans they claim to support. You break the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=90.34s)]
*  bipartisan agreement. You own the consequences that follow. Elon Musk [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=94.02s)]
*  wrote back. You, Jeffries, seem to think the public is dumb. They are not. And [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=98.98s)]
*  now Speaker Johnson needs a plan B after coming here to promote a this time [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  Remember, right now we only control one half of one third of the federal [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=110.66s)]
*  government. Remember, Democrats are still in charge of the Senate and the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  White House. We decided even though we don't normally like short term stop [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=118.7s)]
*  get funding measures, it made sense here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=122.89999999999999s)]
*  Well, conservatives didn't think so. The president elect doesn't think so. If a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=126.74s)]
*  government shutdown can be avoided by tomorrow night's deadline, it's going to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=131.54s)]
*  require Speaker Johnson to break his own rule that lawmakers get three days to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=134.98s)]
*  read bills before voting on them. Back to you. Hey, Peter, do your sources say [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=139.74s)]
*  progress was made last night? Do you think that because J. D. Vance was in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=144.10000000000002s)]
*  there for a long time, acting more like a vice president, I understand. J. D. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  Vance was in there late enough until almost 10 o'clock that when he walked [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=153.58s)]
*  out, his kid was in pajamas to go home. And so we understand that they're at [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=156.9s)]
*  least moving forward. But it depends on how you define progress. Is there going [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=162.22s)]
*  to be a government? Is it avoiding a government shutdown? Is it saving Mike [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=167.86s)]
*  Johnson's speakership? And those are really the two big things right now, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=172.74s)]
*  because Donald Trump is involved now, but he was not really involved until things [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=177.78s)]
*  were really spiraling out of control yesterday. And it also kind of could [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  redefine what Doge is, because for the last couple of weeks since the election, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=189.94000000000003s)]
*  there's been a lot of excitement on Capitol Hill with lawmakers coming out [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=194.86s)]
*  and saying we support Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy and this effort that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=198.02s)]
*  they're going to help us do that. We're going to go through line by line with [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=202.26s)]
*  them and identify all this waste and we're going to cut it. And they're going [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=205.34s)]
*  to be working with us. But that's not what it looks like, at least in this [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=208.46s)]
*  first iteration. It's not Elon Musk working with them. It's Elon Musk [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=212.18s)]
*  warning them that if they support bad plans, then he's going to use a bank [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=215.98s)]
*  account that is bigger than anybody else's in the world to fund primary [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=221.82s)]
*  challenges. So was there progress? Yes. It just depends on which one of those [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=226.1s)]
*  lanes you are rooting for. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=233.7s)]
*  Well, at least JD Vance's kids were still up to say good night to dad in the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=235.73999999999998s)]
*  pajamas. That's important. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=240.5s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=242.1s)]
*  They're saying the spending package was just too unpopular because of its size. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=243.45999999999998s)]
*  So if they're negotiating, they're probably asking to pull things out of the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  1500 page document or bill. There are 72 pages in there about pandemic [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=251.7s)]
*  preparedness and response. You always talk about how much money we have [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=256.74s)]
*  leftover from the pandemic. So why do we need this renewal of the much [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=260.5s)]
*  criticized global engagement center, a football stadium in D.C., a new bridge in [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=264.5s)]
*  Baltimore, a pay increase for Congress. And now now we have to come up with a [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=269.78s)]
*  new bill. The speaker's vote is on January 3rd and there are four hundred [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=274.9s)]
*  and thirty four members to start this new Congress and Johnson's going to need [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=278.94s)]
*  two hundred and eighteen votes. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=282.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Johnson Ainsley is probably toast at this point. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=283.94s)]
*  And all that stuff that you see on the screen right there, there are two things [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=287.06s)]
*  that this Congress has got to fund. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=291.17999999999995s)]
*  They've got to fund disaster relief and they've got to fund the farm bill. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=292.78s)]
*  And so the Democrats said, OK, we'll give you one hundred billion dollars for the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=296.38s)]
*  farm bill, Mr. Speaker, but we're going to have to get all this other stuff. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=299.29999999999995s)]
*  And that's why Doge goes, hey, wait a minute, we're all about saving money and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=302.82s)]
*  you can't just start writing checks. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=306.53999999999996s)]
*  They're not in power yet. I mean, this is not this is not Donald Trump's [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=309.41999999999996s)]
*  White House yet. So I don't know how much power Speaker Johnson they think Speaker [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=313.41999999999996s)]
*  Johnson has. Well, he's got the majority. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=317.5s)]
*  Right. But he's got a majority. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=319.53999999999996s)]
*  But he doesn't have the Senate. He doesn't have the White House. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=320.94s)]
*  So he's got a slight advantage. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=323.86s)]
*  Look at this last one. It was up on your screen. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=325.94s)]
*  Look at this last one. Spending three million to test the inspection of molasses. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=328.66s)]
*  It's thank goodness. It shouldn't be in the bill. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=332.5s)]
*  No, it should not be in the bill. They need a clean bill. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=334.02s)]
*  The thing that is concerning and, you know, I talked about our conversation [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=337.14s)]
*  with the president yesterday, the president-elect yesterday and his concerns [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=341.3s)]
*  about John Kennedy says when I interviewed him last hour. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=344.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you should play that. He he's the only person that the president-elect [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=348.1s)]
*  can get the full house on board. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=353.9s)]
*  We also had this to say. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=356.54s)]
*  I knew as soon as I saw the bill, it was going to be trouble. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=359.46000000000004s)]
*  The thing was as big as a Costco. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  This can be fixed. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=367.1s)]
*  Here's what if I were king for a day, I'm not. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=369.42s)]
*  And I don't aspire to be. Here's what I do. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=372.06s)]
*  First, I would tell everybody to take their meds. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=374.86s)]
*  Number two, I think President Trump is going to have to consider coming to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=378.62s)]
*  Washington. I mean, let's face it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=382.90000000000003s)]
*  He's the president now. It's not President Biden. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=385.54s)]
*  President Trump needs to sit down with Mike Johnson and John Thune and come up [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=389.06s)]
*  with a new skinny CR. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=393.18s)]
*  That's the big question. Is the president-elect you guys know what I'm [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=396.38s)]
*  going to be doing after the show reaching out to sources about that? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=399.74s)]
*  Is he going to take a trip to Washington and get the full house? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=402.38s)]
*  Well, he can pick up the phone. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=406.5s)]
*  The prop when when we were talking to Speaker Johnson yesterday, we made it [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=408.54s)]
*  very clear because everybody knows this, because there were so many Republicans [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=412.02000000000004s)]
*  who were so hacked off about all that extra largesse in that particular bill. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=415.38s)]
*  The only way Speaker Johnson could drag it across the finish line was with [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=421.34s)]
*  was with dozens of Democrats. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=424.74s)]
*  Now, going forward, Donald Trump wants to extend the debt limit limitations. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=427.34s)]
*  And what that's going to require is not a 50 50 majority. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=433.54s)]
*  It's a 60 percent majority because it's got to be a brand new bill. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=439.1s)]
*  And there's going to be zero buy in from Democrats because Democrats don't want [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=443.90000000000003s)]
*  to help the Republicans. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHR6y3siNdA&t=447.94s)]
