# ’SHAME’: GOP rep shreds ‘Squad’ Dems for refusing to condemn Hamas
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI)
*  Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters shut down the Brooklyn Bridge, marching to anti-Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=0.0s)]
*  rhetoric. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=6.78s)]
*  Flooding city streets in uproar, protesters even defacing New York City businesses plastering [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=7.78s)]
*  storefronts with Zionism is terrorism signs. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=12.5s)]
*  New York Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis joins us now with reaction. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=17.22s)]
*  Congresswoman, thanks for being here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=21.34s)]
*  There are staggering images when you see that many people with that type of a message in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=23.86s)]
*  New York City. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=28.18s)]
*  It is and it's happening in places all over the world, predominantly Arab nations. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=29.18s)]
*  But when it happens here in New York City, it really catches our attention because this [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  is happening following the atrocities of Hamas. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=41.1s)]
*  So these individuals are justifying what Hamas has done. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  I think it's important to differentiate between Hamas and the Palestinian civilians who, like [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=48.22s)]
*  Israelis who like Americans, have been killed at the hands of Hamas. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=53.98s)]
*  You just did an entire segment about how they use the Palestinian civilians as shields. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=59.5s)]
*  They set up their command centers, their equipment, their storage facilities. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=66.26s)]
*  They do it in hospitals. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=70.82s)]
*  They do it in schools on purpose. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=72.14s)]
*  So the Palestinian people are actually suffering as a result of Hamas taking control of the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=74.82s)]
*  various areas. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=81.06s)]
*  I think we need to just stand united to condemn this type of terrorism that we know is Iranian [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=82.62s)]
*  backed. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=88.7s)]
*  Seventy percent of Hamas is funded by Iran. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=89.7s)]
*  That is what we did the other day in Congress. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=92.5s)]
*  We sent a very strong message. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=94.86s)]
*  It was a shame that roughly 10 members of Congress, including the entire socialist squad, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=97.14s)]
*  did not vote with us to condemn the atrocities of Hamas killing innocent civilians and instead [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=103.06s)]
*  stand and also stand vocally and unequivocally with Israel at this moment in time. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=111.06s)]
*  Congressman, woman, I want to move to this as well. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=117.06s)]
*  I had dinner last night with a friend. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  I've moved out of New York City now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  It's been a couple of years. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=123.66s)]
*  And he described for me a scene that you would never have seen five years ago in New York [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=125.02s)]
*  City. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=128.66s)]
*  He said, right in the subway now, you will see children, you know, six years old, seven [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=129.66s)]
*  years old, nine years old, begging on the train, going up to people asking for money. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=133.14s)]
*  Clearly, these kids are the children of illegal immigrants. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=139.5s)]
*  The city has changed drastically in just a few short years. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=142.38s)]
*  And now this this this self branding as a sanctuary city has proven to be an absolute [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=148.22s)]
*  farce as the mayor is offering one way tickets to leave New York. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=154.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  The mayor created this crisis in New York City when he sent the message to the world [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=160.82s)]
*  that if you came to New York City, you would receive free housing, obviously at the expense [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=166.14s)]
*  of taxpayers who are now suffering greatly seeing across the board cuts and their tax [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=171.01999999999998s)]
*  dollars that they work so hard for going to to citizens of other countries instead of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=176.22s)]
*  their own families. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=181.66s)]
*  Look, this is we put a lot of pressure on this mayor. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=183.57999999999998s)]
*  I think what you're seeing right now is a result of that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=186.26s)]
*  We've sued to stop a lot of these migrant shelters. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  We've we've we've actually gotten a couple shut down in my district. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=191.98s)]
*  I've actually passed legislation the other day to prevent federal lands like Floyd Bennett [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=196.38s)]
*  Field from being used as migrant encampments. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  So as we continue to do this, we put pressure on the mayor. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=204.33999999999997s)]
*  He's recognizing that if he can't use these these park lands and he can't use schools [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=207.89999999999998s)]
*  because we've sued and we were able to stop that and also that the FDNY, by the way, to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=213.5s)]
*  shut down these facilities because they're not safe for shelter to be shelters or zoned [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=218.45999999999998s)]
*  for it. For that matter, he's recognizing they're running out of options and he's going to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=223.38s)]
*  see opposition from the Republicans in New York City at every single term. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=226.89999999999998s)]
*  We're going to use every legislative and legal action to stop him. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=231.42s)]
*  So I'm glad that at least he's recognizing that we can't continue this nor was right to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=234.54s)]
*  shelter ever intended for homeless citizens of other countries for these illegal immigrants [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=239.33999999999997s)]
*  that are coming in mass over our southern border. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=244.5s)]
*  It was meant for homeless New Yorkers. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=246.5s)]
*  In fact, in the lawsuit, the judge affirmed that in his decision. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=248.74s)]
*  So that gave the mayor an out now to to to stop housing them. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  Let's see what he does. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=256.62s)]
*  Congresswoman, really quick, we're running out of time. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=257.86s)]
*  I want to ask you about Representative Bowman. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=259.82s)]
*  We know that he now was caught on video that he lied, that it was clearly he was trying [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=263.38s)]
*  to interfere with that official proceeding. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=268.90000000000003s)]
*  We know there are J sixers who are languishing in prisons being charged with that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=271.7s)]
*  What is going to happen? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  Are you as a Republican, as Republicans now under new leadership, going to make sure that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=277.7s)]
*  he receives maximum punishment for this? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=283.02s)]
*  If nothing else, in the interest of equal justice? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=286.06s)]
*  Well, I've already introduced a resolution to expel Mr. Bowman. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  I think either expulsion or censorship will happen depending on the votes, because we [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=294.94s)]
*  need Democratic votes in order to expel him. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=301.26s)]
*  And they're probably not there. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=304.14s)]
*  But what I will say is it is disappointing to see that he's only being slapped with a [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=306.14s)]
*  misdemeanor, that if he actually pays a fine and writes an apology letter that this could [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=309.58s)]
*  be expunged, you know, it should be a federal offense like you mentioned, equivalent to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=313.42s)]
*  individuals who disrupted government proceedings in January six. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=320.42s)]
*  So I think that we have to continue to push for this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=323.62s)]
*  But it just shows you again, the double standard here that he was only treated with a misdemeanor. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=327.34s)]
*  This is a guy, by the way, who was a school principal. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=332.14s)]
*  So he knows very well what pulling a fire alarm is. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=334.34s)]
*  In his school, it would be suspension or expulsion. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=336.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=339.97999999999996s)]
*  All right, Congresswoman Nicole Madotakis, thank you so much for being with us this morning. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=340.97999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=343.73999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=344.73999999999995s)]
*  All right, we'll be right back. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QauHpRwjunI&t=345.73999999999995s)]
