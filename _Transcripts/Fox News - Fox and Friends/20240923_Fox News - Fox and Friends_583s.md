# Patricia Heaton: I couldn't believe this happened
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs)
*  Now she is taking on a new fight by launching a nonprofit October 7 coalition, a network [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=0.0s)]
*  of Christians standing in support of Jews and against anti-Semitism. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=6.98s)]
*  And Patricia Heaton joins us right now on the curvy couch here in New York City. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=11.46s)]
*  I love the curvy couch. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=15.5s)]
*  We love you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=17.46s)]
*  We do. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=18.46s)]
*  So tell us about, we know what happened on October 7th. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=19.46s)]
*  You have started this movement now, this new idea, this new organization because of inactivity. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=23.72s)]
*  Yes, you know, my dad served in World War II. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=29.54s)]
*  We grew up with shows like The Hiding Place about Corey Ten Boom and the Holocaust with [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=32.699999999999996s)]
*  Meryl Streep and James Wood. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=37.18s)]
*  So we knew Nazis are bad, not focusing on Jewish people is terrible. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=38.26s)]
*  So when October 7th happened and I saw it happening all over again, this time with Hamas [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=44.54s)]
*  body cam footage proudly putting it on social media, I couldn't believe my eyes. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=50.18s)]
*  And not only that, about 48 hours later, campuses exploded with pro-Hamas protests [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=56.56s)]
*  and making Israel the bad guy and making Jewish people the bad guy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=68.68s)]
*  And I was outraged. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=69.68s)]
*  And I looked around for everyone else who was going to be outraged, I assume, because [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=70.68s)]
*  we all know this is terrible. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=75.16s)]
*  And it was very silent. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=77.0s)]
*  So my partner and I created the October 7th coalition or O7C to help Christians activate [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=78.84s)]
*  to be as visibly and vocally supportive of Israel, the Jewish people and fight anti-Semitism [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=85.12s)]
*  as the other side was, because those protests were very organized. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  Those posters had been printed and ready to go for a long time. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  This has been in the works for a while. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  And so we need to step up and be as vocal and visible as the other side. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  My family were watching The Chosen and in every scene when they're entering into their [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  houses they kiss the mezuzah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  And tell us the significance of that and what your announcement is today. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  So the mezuzah is this beautiful little container that has a prayer that honors God and blesses [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=113.24s)]
*  your household. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=120.92s)]
*  And Jewish people put it on the door frame of their door as they were commanded to. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=122.28s)]
*  And it's been a tradition for thousands of years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  There I am putting it on my door. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=130.35999999999999s)]
*  October 7th coalition is starting a campaign, my mezuzah, your mezuzah. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=132.68s)]
*  And it's kind of a Spartacus moment because Jewish students at college campuses have had [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=139.08s)]
*  a mezuzah on their door and they've been ripped off, they've been vandalized, they've been [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=144.56s)]
*  found smashed. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  And I think we have to stand up for the Jewish people and for their right to exist, their [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=149.72000000000003s)]
*  right to be Jewish and practice their faith. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=155.08s)]
*  So that's what we've been working on. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=157.72000000000003s)]
*  We're launching today, My Zuzah, Yours is a Campaign. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  You can go to myzuzah.org slash shop and you can buy one, put it on your door, make a video [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=162.12s)]
*  of it, post it on your social media, say My Zuzah, Yours is a, we can all stand up together. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=168.88s)]
*  So I'm curious, what's been the support like amongst your colleagues? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=174.32s)]
*  It seems like there's been the popular view is just to think of the children that are [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=178.8s)]
*  in Gaza and even as a support Israel, we think about the children there, but we realize that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=183.76s)]
*  Hamas is using the children as human shields. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=188.64s)]
*  Have your colleagues been supportive of this cause that you're having right now? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=192.32s)]
*  Nobody wants war. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=197.52s)]
*  Nobody wants kids to die. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=199.36s)]
*  That's not the point. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=201.36s)]
*  The point is Hamas has started all of this. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=202.84s)]
*  Hamas is using their own people, adults and children as shields. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=206.0s)]
*  They are putting them in front as fodder. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=210.96s)]
*  And so I think my community in Hollywood think more with their hearts. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=213.52s)]
*  And when they hear that people are losing their lives, they get very upset as we all [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=218.72000000000003s)]
*  are. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  But the solution to it is not for Israel to do a ceasefire. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=223.88s)]
*  It's for Hamas to release the hostages, put down their arms. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=228.2s)]
*  And Hamas is a terrorist organization. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=232.68s)]
*  It's not a legitimate government. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  They need to be out of business. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=236.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=238.28s)]
*  So let me ask you about this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=239.48s)]
*  You mentioned a moment ago what we saw on America's campuses last spring. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=241.56s)]
*  We're seeing it again. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=246.52s)]
*  And you know, when you were setting up what you're doing, you talked about, you know, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=248.2s)]
*  in the old days, we knew who the bad guys were. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=252.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=254.28s)]
*  How come so many young people are on the side of the bad guys? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=255.24s)]
*  The universities have been taking billions of dollars from Qatar and other places and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=259.0s)]
*  putting professors in who are very anti-Israel. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=266.12s)]
*  And students, you know, they're in the formative stage. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=270.04s)]
*  They want their lives to have meaning. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=273.24s)]
*  They want to be fighting for a great cause. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=275.48s)]
*  And unfortunately, their minds have been twisted and propagandized to believe that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=277.88s)]
*  being pro-Hamas is somehow helping people when they are throwing gay people off of buildings, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  they're suppressing women, they're marrying young girls off to old men. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=290.36s)]
*  It's the worst philosophy you could run a country by. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=295.0s)]
*  We have watched you for decades. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=301.32s)]
*  You're so funny. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=303.8s)]
*  You're an actress. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=304.6s)]
*  You're a mother to four boys. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=305.24s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=306.52s)]
*  Your faith is extremely important to you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=307.0s)]
*  You recently moved to Nashville. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=309.08s)]
*  Tell us about that experience and how you really became so strong in your faith. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=310.44s)]
*  You know, I'm Catholic. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=315.96s)]
*  My grandmother had 15 kids, was Catholic Mother of the Year for the United States, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=317.8s)]
*  got a medal from the Pope. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=322.36s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=323.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=324.12s)]
*  I have about 100 first cousins on my mom's side of the family because all 15 got married [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=324.68s)]
*  and had between five and 10 kids. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=328.92s)]
*  So, you know, that's just been a part of me growing up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=330.84s)]
*  I think when October 7th happened, this one scripture from Paul to the Ephesians came [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=333.8s)]
*  into my mind. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=339.0s)]
*  Put on the full armor of God so that when the day of evil comes, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=341.08s)]
*  you do everything you can to stand and after you've done everything, stand. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=345.24s)]
*  My partner and I, this is our motto for October 7th coalition, we stand with the Jewish people, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=350.36s)]
*  which is also standing for Christianity. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=356.28s)]
*  It's standing for Judeo-Christian principles, for freedom, for everything we hold dear and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=358.44s)]
*  that people spill their blood for. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=362.92s)]
*  That's what we're standing for. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=364.76s)]
*  So we had an opportunity to meet before we got on camera and I asked you, I go, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  what about the opportunities? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=371.32s)]
*  Are you concerned about missed opportunity? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=374.04s)]
*  And you said, I can't be. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=375.64000000000004s)]
*  Can you explain to our audience why standing boldly matters more to you than the opportunities [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=377.64000000000004s)]
*  that may or may not come your way as a result of your positions? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=385.16s)]
*  You know, God really is in charge of my career. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=388.44s)]
*  And so far, he's given me two incredibly well-written, beautifully produced award-winning [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=391.96s)]
*  TV shows that each went for nine years. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=397.79999999999995s)]
*  I've gotten some Emmys. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  I have a star in the Walk of Fame. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm not bragging, but I'm just saying. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=403.4s)]
*  It sounds like we're bragging. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=404.76s)]
*  No, just a little bit. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=405.96s)]
*  You're bragging about what God's done in your life. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=409.32s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=411.0s)]
*  And so I trust him because he has not failed me yet. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=411.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=415.64s)]
*  What's interesting is as a Catholic, a practicing Catholic, what you're doing is you're essentially [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=416.59999999999997s)]
*  activating Christians. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=424.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=425.79999999999995s)]
*  And you told one of our producers, surprisingly, the Christian community, churches and pastors [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=426.44s)]
*  have been far too silent about what happened on October 7th. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=431.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, what's interesting is most of Christians, especially evangelicals, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=435.55999999999995s)]
*  they've all been to Israel. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=439.23999999999995s)]
*  They love Israel. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=440.28s)]
*  They don't know their Jewish neighbors at home. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=441.32s)]
*  And so, and they also, some people feel awkward. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=444.04s)]
*  They just don't know what to do. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=446.44s)]
*  You know, after October 7th happened, I texted all my Jewish friends and said, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=447.8s)]
*  how are you doing? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=451.48s)]
*  They said terribly, and you're the only person that has asked us. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=452.52s)]
*  And I think people don't know that that means something to your Jewish friends. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=456.68s)]
*  And so that's why we started October 7th coalition. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=461.24s)]
*  So we create opportunities for Christians to come out and support their Jewish neighbors [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=464.36s)]
*  with unity dinners. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=468.6s)]
*  We did an evening at the Nova Festival exhibit, which was here. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=470.04s)]
*  It's now in Los Angeles. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=474.28000000000003s)]
*  And we sold that out. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=475.88s)]
*  We've had between 250 and 500 people come to our dinners to meet their Jewish neighbors, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=477.32s)]
*  to be together. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=482.12s)]
*  We've brought Israeli musicians over who've just finished their IDF services, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=483.24s)]
*  and we've produced their music in Nashville. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=487.32000000000005s)]
*  It's called the Promise Sessions. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=489.56s)]
*  You can go to promiseessions.com and listen to their music. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=491.0s)]
*  So we're just trying to integrate our communities, which have been sort of siloed for too long. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=494.04s)]
*  So today you are launching this campaign. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=499.4s)]
*  Once again, we had a graphic. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=501.47999999999996s)]
*  We put it up a moment ago. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=502.67999999999995s)]
*  This is how we want you. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=503.88s)]
*  This is how you can help her. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=505.32s)]
*  Take your video of you putting up the mizuzah, like we just saw there. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=507.4s)]
*  Then post your video, write your message. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=513.0s)]
*  I use the hashtag my mizuzah, your mizuzah. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=516.04s)]
*  My zuzah, your zuzah. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=518.68s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=519.88s)]
*  Post any time from now until October the 7th. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=521.0799999999999s)]

*  They really do. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=549.72s)]
*  So we're just happy to serve and create a space where we can all come together [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=550.8399999999999s)]
*  and fight for the things that we all believe in. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=556.04s)]
*  I am so in love with you. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPmkXLcW8xs&t=558.4399999999999s)]
