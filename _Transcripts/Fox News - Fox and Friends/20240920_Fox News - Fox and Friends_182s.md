# CNN reporter torched for lecture to pro-Trump boat owner: 'Activist reporter'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0)
*  There was a MAGA boat parade in Panama City, Florida. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=0.0s)]
*  CNN Anderson Cooper sent one of his reporters out [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  to be on his show and interview people in the boat parade. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=6.72s)]
*  And the reporter he sends out is lecturing one [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  of the guys she interviews because he has a boat. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=15.92s)]
*  She can afford a boat. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=17.76s)]
*  You're not hurting so bad, right? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=19.52s)]
*  Cause a boat costs a lot of money and it's a lot of upkeep. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=21.36s)]
*  Listen, nobody gave me a ****. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=24.36s)]
*  I earned everything that I've got. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=26.48s)]
*  I'm retired military, retired power plant, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=28.52s)]
*  and I am successful and retired with boats, jet skis, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=30.8s)]
*  because I did it right. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=35.2s)]
*  And everybody has that chance. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=36.48s)]
*  Whether they choose or not, that's up to them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=38.64s)]
*  Cause I want my money to go further. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=40.76s)]
*  I want inflation to go down. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=42.72s)]
*  I want interest rates to go back down. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  I want all that, but that covers everybody in the economy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Not just me, not just the poor, not just the rich. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  It covers everybody. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=52.72s)]
*  Fact that they felt comfortable airing this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=54.16s)]
*  after such a nasty question to an American voter out there. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=57.0s)]
*  I mean, this just shows you that it's just become activism [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=61.76s)]
*  with their news division over there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, just because you buy a boat, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=66.88s)]
*  you gotta keep the boat, you gotta pay for it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=68.44s)]
*  Some people live on their boat. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=70.32s)]
*  I mean, it's such a disingenuous approach to people. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=71.84s)]
*  Everyone knows, not just for rich people, poor people, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=75.2s)]
*  people in the middle class, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=78.04s)]
*  the number one issue is the economy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=78.88s)]
*  For her to say, oh, okay, cause you have a boat, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=80.92s)]
*  that your concern doesn't matter. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=84.68s)]
*  Or if I'm not concerned, it's just because I don't have, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=86.8s)]
*  it doesn't mean I don't care about other people, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=89.52s)]
*  my kids coming up, or my grandparents that might be out there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=91.16s)]
*  There's nothing wrong for wanting to keep your own money, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=94.76s)]
*  the money, the hardworking money. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=96.84s)]
*  The guy's name, Joe Harner, a Trump supporter, obviously, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=99.2s)]
*  but here's the thing, he made it very clear, I'm retired. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=104.0s)]
*  When you are retired, you are on a fixed income. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=106.64s)]
*  You don't have a lot of extra money. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=110.0s)]
*  And as we have told you, ad nauseum is currently [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=111.68s)]
*  the rate of inflation, particularly for groceries. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=115.88s)]
*  We're all paying 22% more for groceries [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=118.6s)]
*  than we did four years ago. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  Joe's gotta pay more for groceries, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=122.32s)]
*  gotta pay more for gas, he gotta pay more for everything. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  He's just got a certain amount of the pie, a pot of cash. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=126.52s)]
*  He can't afford a shirt. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he's retired military, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=132.24s)]
*  deserves to be on that beach with his beer, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=135.6s)]
*  without his shirt, and having that boat. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=137.28s)]
*  But she kept going. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=139.32s)]
*  She said to him, groceries are probably a smaller part [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=140.2s)]
*  than someone who's worse off. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=144.01999999999998s)]
*  It's unbelievable, just an activist reporter. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  At least they did run it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  They didn't have to run it, they ran it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=150.5s)]
*  That's true. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  Right, I also saw when they went after Trump [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=153.42s)]
*  at his speech in front of the anti-Semitic conference, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=156.66s)]
*  he came out and he said, look, if you're a Democrat, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=159.85999999999999s)]
*  I don't understand how you could vote, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=162.42s)]
*  if you're a Jewish person in America, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=164.61999999999998s)]
*  how you could vote for a Democrat, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=166.54s)]
*  they're gonna destroy Israel. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=168.06s)]
*  And that's all they focused on there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=169.33999999999997s)]
*  How could Donald Trump threaten Democrats? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=170.86s)]
*  He's not threatening them, he's trying to say, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=174.26000000000002s)]
*  I'm pro-Israel, you saw what I did for four years. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=176.10000000000002s)]
*  That was their angle on covering Trump. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=178.98000000000002s)]
*  Corrupt. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28qwAN8Jc0&t=181.46s)]
