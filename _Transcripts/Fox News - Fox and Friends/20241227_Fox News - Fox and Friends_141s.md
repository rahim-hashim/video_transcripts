# 'This is a lot!': Hosts amazed at Biden's vacation total
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM)
*  Hey, speaking of doing nothing, if you're on vacation, we're not attacking you right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=0.0s)]
*  We're not. You worked hard, you worked your tail off all 2024, and you're taking a little time [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=6.08s)]
*  with friends and family. This guy is different. Joe Biden, he has spent 570 days on vacation [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=11.52s)]
*  the last four years. Get out your calculator, America. That is 40% of his presidency. That [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=20.0s)]
*  means four out of every 10 days for those of you who aren't good at math. Joe Biden has spent [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=27.92s)]
*  on a beach or otherwise at some form of not working. Todd, did you do that math? Of course, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=33.440000000000005s)]
*  I got up here early this morning. I was afraid to do the numbers. That's 40%. That's a lot. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=39.36s)]
*  40% on vacation. You know, only one person gets to be president. It is a grueling job. It demands [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=50.08s)]
*  more of you than most people. You can't compare the job of presidency to any other occupation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=56.8s)]
*  And if you're going to go and ask for it, beg for it, you got to be able to do it. And that 40% [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  on vacation tells me he might not have been up for that job. Yeah, and also a lot of these [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=67.28s)]
*  vacations, you know, the White House argues the president can work from anywhere. So if he's at [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=71.92s)]
*  his beach house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, then he has everything he needs, command center, etc. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=75.92s)]
*  He's in St. Croix until the new year, allegedly staying at a big donor's house. They won't [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=82.4s)]
*  confirm that, but that's where he stayed in the past. His image of him laying on the beach. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=87.28s)]
*  Beautiful. A lot of these things happen when there were major things happening in the world, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=91.44000000000001s)]
*  like our troops coming under fire in the Middle East, for example, wars breaking out all over [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=95.76s)]
*  the place. So that the course of his four years, the timing of these vacations also was a big [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=101.12s)]
*  problem. And the optics of it certainly didn't help him when it came to trying to run for [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=107.04s)]
*  reelection and then also getting kicked off of his own party's ticket as Americans watched that and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=111.76s)]
*  said, where's the leadership? The world is on fire and the president is sprawled out on the beach. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=115.92s)]
*  Joe, I want to take issue with something that you said. You said only one person can be president. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=120.4s)]
*  That Wall Street Journal article seemed to imply that no, multiple people can be president at once, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=124.4s)]
*  and they were for the last four years. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=128.72s)]
*  Our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AD6kP5-dvM&t=137.04s)]
