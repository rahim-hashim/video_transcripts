# Trump is 'picking up where he left off,' retired U.S. general says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM)
*  Not even two weeks in office, President Trump already scoring another victory for the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=0.0s)]
*  This one against ISIS. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=4.96s)]
*  He ordered a military airstrike against the terror group's leaders in Somalia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=5.96s)]
*  The president saying in part, these killers who we found hiding in caves threatened the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=10.28s)]
*  United States and our allies. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=14.88s)]
*  The strikes destroyed the caves they live in and killed many terrorists without in any [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=16.9s)]
*  way harming civilians. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=21.96s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about facing the war on terror. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=23.44s)]
*  Retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Rob Spalding joins us now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=26.4s)]
*  General, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=30.2s)]
*  Looking at this happening, this is the first major military move under President Trump [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=32.44s)]
*  and DOD Secretary Hegseth. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  I know that a lot of intelligence is needed for an operation like this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=40.04s)]
*  Do you feel like this is something the Biden administration could have done or was sitting [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  on and the Trump administration came in and said, no, we're going to make this happen? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=48.06s)]
*  Or do these things materialize so quickly this might not have been an option two weeks [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=51.4s)]
*  ago? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=54.44s)]
*  I do. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=56.32s)]
*  You know, I worked in the Biden administration. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=57.32s)]
*  I worked in the or excuse me, the Obama administration. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=60.08s)]
*  I worked in the Trump administration. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=63.76s)]
*  I saw the difference in differences in decision making. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=65.36s)]
*  I think he's picking up where he left off with the Soleimani strike. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=68.96s)]
*  And I think he's putting fear back into the equation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=73.88s)]
*  I think a lot of people think because he says he's about not having wars or starting wars, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=77.2s)]
*  he won't use military action when it's appropriate. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=83.52s)]
*  In this case, it was. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=86.84s)]
*  I've seen the National Security Council agonize over these decisions. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=88.36s)]
*  And then what happens is these terrorists end up getting away. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  So it's good to see him actually making a quick decision to go after the threat. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=96.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=100.92s)]
*  I just want to correct real quick. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=101.92s)]
*  You're an Air Force Brigadier General, not Army. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=103.92s)]
*  I think I read that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=105.84s)]
*  So I don't want to get yourself or me in trouble over that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=106.84s)]
*  I apologize to both services. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  To move on with this, when we look at the Africa theater, a lot of people, I'd say a [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=113.08s)]
*  lot of civilians don't really know we're active there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=117.0s)]
*  As a Marine, I know you fear to go to Djibouti because it's really hot there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=119.44s)]
*  But even in North Africa, there's a lot going on and there's a lot our military has to do. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=123.36s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about the threat in the African theater. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, a lot of the terrorists have tried to migrate there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=130.4s)]
*  One of the things that they are trying to get away from is the ability for our intelligence [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=134.84s)]
*  assets to find them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=139.04s)]
*  It's also hard to get into some of those places in Africa just because we don't have good [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=141.12s)]
*  access many times. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=145.84s)]
*  We face this in the B2, which I flew. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=148.4s)]
*  And so I think we're getting better at finding these places. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=151.24s)]
*  And when we find them, we're actually going after the people that are there. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=157.4s)]
*  So I think we're proving that there's really no place on earth that you can hide. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  By taking action now, it prevents having a larger conflict, a bigger role for the military. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=166.24s)]
*  It really cuts it off before it has a chance to metastasize. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=176.28s)]
*  Proud Air Force General Rob Spalding. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=178.8s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us and thank you for your insight. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=181.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-VEbLm0vM&t=186.04000000000002s)]
