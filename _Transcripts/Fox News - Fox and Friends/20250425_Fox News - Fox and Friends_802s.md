# Putin is going 'full throttle,' retired general warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4)
*  Today, Special Envoy Steve Witkov is meeting with Vladimir Putin again in Moscow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=0.0s)]
*  This follows Russia's attacks in Kiev. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=6.78s)]
*  They were just abhorrent yesterday, leaving at least 12 innocent people dead, with President [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=8.86s)]
*  Trump pushing for an end to the war. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=13.22s)]
*  I have no allegiance to anybody. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=16.56s)]
*  I have allegiance to saving lives, and I want to save a lot of lives. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=19.48s)]
*  A lot of young people's, mostly young people, it's the war. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=22.8s)]
*  It's the soldiers. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=26.62s)]
*  And if we can do that, also, as you know, I got started because the money that's been [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=27.76s)]
*  spent on this war is insane. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=32.72s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=35.6s)]
*  Five thousand soldiers a week on average. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=37.08s)]
*  And we want to stop that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=41.6s)]
*  So Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst General Jack Keene. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=43.64s)]
*  The President always makes that clear. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=46.8s)]
*  It's his objective to stop the killing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=48.28s)]
*  Are they on, are they in route to stopping the killing? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=50.72s)]
*  It doesn't appear so, based on where we are, for a couple of reasons. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=56.24s)]
*  One, Zelensky and his team accepted a 30-day ceasefire and, you know, removed the condition. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  He wanted some kind of security guarantees to be able to do that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=66.92s)]
*  Russia was offered the same thing, and they have rejected it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  And not only that, they have continued to focus on killing civilians, targeting civilians, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=75.36s)]
*  because they want to break the will of the Ukrainian people and put pressure on Zelensky [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=82.56s)]
*  and also on our administration to make more concessions. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=87.92s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=91.92s)]
*  I mean, this is full throttle on the part of Putin. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=92.92s)]
*  He is the problem here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=95.72s)]
*  He has been the problem from the beginning, because he obviously invaded the country illegally. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=97.52s)]
*  And he committed genocide. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=102.36s)]
*  He's a thug and he's a killer and he's a war criminal. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=103.6s)]
*  And he certainly only wants to go to that negotiating table and probably make a deal [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=106.56s)]
*  unless he's able to get concessions that make Ukraine very vulnerable to a future attack, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=112.08s)]
*  because he has not given up one iota. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=119.84s)]
*  Our intelligence services publicly have released information that demonstrates the fact that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=122.4s)]
*  Russia fully intends to take control of Ukraine and then also other countries in Eastern [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  Europe. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=135.72s)]
*  That's his objective, and we have to keep that in mind when we're dealing with him. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=136.32s)]
*  General, you just told me something in the break I did not think was possible. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=141.4s)]
*  The Ukrainians want to write a check to buy Patriot missiles, a defense battery, and we [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=146.56s)]
*  said no? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=151.12s)]
*  Yeah, we did. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=152.96s)]
*  I'm not sure the reason why, but it opens up the door for an avenue that we really need [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=155.28s)]
*  to take advantage of. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  The State Department has a program called Foreign Military Financing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=162.76s)]
*  That is direct loans where you can get military equipment, you pay back the loan at interest. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  So the government makes money here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=174.56s)]
*  Poland is buying tanks, helicopters, air defense systems, high mars, etc. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=177.16s)]
*  Over $10 billion worth of stuff. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=183.04s)]
*  The Ukrainians can do the same because now they have collateral in the mineral, rare [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=185.04s)]
*  mineral development and other things in the country. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=190.6s)]
*  And also they obviously have some money because people have been giving them money, and that's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=194.12s)]
*  what they wanted to do with the Patriot systems. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=198.36s)]
*  We can take the American taxpayer out of this and fund Ukraine's military buildup rather [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=201.56s)]
*  significantly. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=208.72s)]
*  Look at it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=210.08s)]
*  Putin is going to reject, which I think he's going to do the deal. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=210.76s)]
*  What then do we do? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=214.12s)]
*  One, crippling sanctions would be option one. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  And two, up gun Ukraine. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=219.28s)]
*  Up gun Ukraine to bring Putin to the negotiating table. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=222.12s)]
*  Not so Ukraine can continue to fight, but Putin pays attention to that military equation [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  and who has an advantage there more than anything else. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=231.88s)]
*  Actually more than sanctions. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  I just hope the President knows. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  These are levers that we can use. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=237.88s)]
*  We can use these levers. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=239.76s)]
*  I hope the President knows that this happens. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=241.0s)]
*  Sometimes it happens beneath his level because this is defense. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=242.92s)]
*  Who would not want to block a rocket from going into a city? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=246.12s)]
*  Lavrov told Face the Nation that he says, the President of the United States and I think [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=251.04s)]
*  rightly so that we are moving in the right direction and they are heading towards peace. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=257.4s)]
*  They are ready to reach a deal. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=262.36s)]
*  Do you believe the Foreign Minister of Russia? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=264.48s)]
*  Just real quick because I want to get to Iran too. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=266.32s)]
*  No, he lies through his teeth. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=268.76s)]
*  He's been lying for 25 years just like the guy he works for. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=271.44s)]
*  This is all the Russian's narrative, their playbook, their propaganda. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  Where's the evidence of that to date? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=279.08s)]
*  They walked away from what was reasonable. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=282.08s)]
*  The President offered them a 30 day ceasefire. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=285.76s)]
*  Not six months, not a year, not permanent, 30 days. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=288.35999999999996s)]
*  Zelensky says yes, the Russians say no. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  That's where they really are. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  By going this far, the President took political risk in giving Vladimir Putin a chance at [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=296.67999999999995s)]
*  peace. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=300.48s)]
*  He's better not embarrass the President in my view because he'll feel the backlash. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=301.48s)]
*  He already got rebuked yesterday. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=305.40000000000003s)]
*  So now tomorrow, third state week of nuke talks with Iran, they named Michael Anton, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=307.24s)]
*  senior State Department official, to lead the technical team on Iran's nuclear negotiations. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=313.56s)]
*  How do you feel about where we're at right now? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  What do your sources tell you? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=321.12s)]
*  What kind of progress is being made? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=322.68s)]
*  Well, we'll have to see. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=324.6s)]
*  We know a couple of things. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=328.36s)]
*  Iran's not going to dismantle the program as we asked them to do by a date certain with [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=330.36s)]
*  inspections and verification. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=336.56s)]
*  Obviously, that's not happening. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  That's the same thing that Obama did, by the way. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=341.8s)]
*  When they began negotiations in 2013, they told Iran to dismantle your program, give [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=344.16s)]
*  up enrichment, give up the centrifuges, give up your ballistic missiles. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=348.32000000000005s)]
*  They balked and then we accepted civil nuclear power enrichment. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  They kept their centrifuges and they kept their ballistic missiles. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=358.92s)]
*  They eventually got real close to a nuclear weapon, as we all know, which is the concern [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=361.76s)]
*  we have today. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=365.92s)]
*  The Iranians are masters at working these negotiations to their favor. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=367.36s)]
*  So we have to keep an eye on this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=372.68s)]
*  Certainly the administration wants a nuclear program that cannot even come close to weaponization. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=374.68s)]
*  But even if you take away all the enrichment and leave the centrifuges and the ballistic [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  missiles, they can get enriched uranium from many countries. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=387.2s)]
*  We get it from four or five different countries to include Russia. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=391.84s)]
*  China, Russia, and North Korea all have enriched uranium. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=395.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=399.68s)]
*  Because they all have nuclear weapons and they're their closest allies. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=400.68s)]
*  So clandestinely, they can still get enriched uranium and they keep the centrifuges to spin [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=403.79999999999995s)]
*  that and get it to weaponization grade and they keep the ballistic missiles so they can [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=410.64s)]
*  deliver it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=415.96s)]
*  That's what we have to be very careful of going forward here. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=416.96s)]
*  We've got to be Americans on the ground watching the dismantling of that program in the way [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=420.2s)]
*  Libya did and South Africa did and Ukraine did. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=424.96s)]
*  And that's just the beginning. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=428.68s)]
*  I'm not sure the Israelis are going to sit on the side if they think it's a bad deal. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=429.68s)]
*  General Jack Keene, there's so much going on. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=434.35999999999996s)]
*  The Institute of Study of War helps unwind it on a daily basis and you're chairman of [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=436.08s)]
*  that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=440.56s)]
*  Thanks so much, General. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=441.56s)]
*  Have a great weekend. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=442.56s)]
*  So NATO chief Mark Rudy meeting with secretaries Pete Hegseth, Marco Rubio in Washington, and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=444.88s)]
*  Mike Waltz, by the way, as US plans to pull back on funding for the alliance. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=451.24s)]
*  It's why NATO leaders are pushing member nations to pay their fair share while larger countries [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=456.44s)]
*  like Canada and Spain are contributing under 2% of their GDP. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=460.96s)]
*  You see these numbers right in front of you. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=464.56s)]
*  Poland's off the charts. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=466.28s)]
*  NATO secretary Rudy joins us right now. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=468.36s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, great to see you. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=471.04s)]
*  Good to be back on the program, Brian. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=472.68s)]
*  So it looks like we're going to put another we are going to put another trillion dollars [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=474.76s)]
*  into our defense budget. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  So we're not going to be the problem when it comes to NATO. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=479.56s)]
*  But do you think that going to 3% and above is going to be possible for a lot of these [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=482.36s)]
*  struggling economies? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=489.15999999999997s)]
*  Yes, they have to make it possible. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=490.76s)]
*  They have to do it and they know they have to do it because and not only because President [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=493.08s)]
*  Trump says it's fair to equalize spending with the United States. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=496.78s)]
*  That's one reason to do it, but also because there is the ongoing threat of the Russians. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=503.08000000000004s)]
*  They are rapidly rearming themselves. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=509.56s)]
*  So we know that if you want to achieve all the targets we need to achieve that on the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=511.82s)]
*  European side of NATO, the Canadian side of NATO, we have to move upwards from 3%. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm pretty confident we can get there and that the summit in The Hague will be a great [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=521.8000000000001s)]
*  success for President Trump to project American power at the world stage, but also for the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=526.6s)]
*  alliance as a whole. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=532.4s)]
*  Sergey Lavrov yesterday said the Russians don't aim at civilian targets. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=534.24s)]
*  Yet the cover of the New York Post today and the video that we have shows they're aiming [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  at civilian targets with a woman sitting there all bloody. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=544.6s)]
*  What do you say to that blatant lie? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=549.16s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=552.48s)]
*  What happened yesterday is a sign of weakness by the Russians that they are not winning [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=553.76s)]
*  this. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=559.12s)]
*  To put missiles, send missiles to residential areas outside Kiev. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=560.28s)]
*  I was visiting the beautiful city of Odessa together with President Zelensky two weeks [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=565.36s)]
*  ago. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=570.36s)]
*  That city is also under constant Russian fire. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=571.36s)]
*  If you're winning a war, you're not going to do that. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=574.76s)]
*  It is a sign of weakness. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=577.0s)]
*  It is terrible. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=578.16s)]
*  There are 12 people dead in Kiev, innocent people just living and going about their lives [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=579.16s)]
*  over every day, small children being hurt. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=584.12s)]
*  We have seen all the footage. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=587.32s)]
*  It really, it cries your heart out when you see it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  So, so yesterday, Ukraine President Vladimir Zelensky claimed Thursday that President Trump [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  blindsided Kiev's negotiators in London by switching out an initial appropriate strategy [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=597.36s)]
*  for a ceasefire with an unacceptable demand that we recognize that Russia owns Crimea, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=603.0799999999999s)]
*  essentially. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=609.7199999999999s)]
*  Did we blindside Kiev? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=610.7199999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=613.4399999999999s)]
*  But let me first of all say that it is thanks to President Trump that the deadlock is broken. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=614.5200000000001s)]
*  It is the U.S. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=620.12s)]
*  It is President Trump who is taking this leadership role. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=621.12s)]
*  And it is only the U.S. and President Trump who can do that, together, of course, with [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=623.96s)]
*  Secretaries Haggard and Rubio and with National Security Adviser Walz being closely with, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=627.8000000000001s)]
*  working with him to get this done. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=633.96s)]
*  So that is important. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=636.0200000000001s)]
*  But when it comes to this particular question, I'm not going to give a running commentary [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=637.0200000000001s)]
*  on every stage of the negotiations. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=641.6400000000001s)]
*  So, of course, there is a difference between acknowledging that parts of a country are [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=644.24s)]
*  occupied or saying legally that they are now part of a different country. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=649.88s)]
*  Take the Baltics, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania in 1950. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=655.44s)]
*  The U.S. and the world never accepted as a judicial fact, as a legal fact that this was [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=659.8s)]
*  part of the Soviet Union. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=666.76s)]
*  But we did acknowledge that Soviet Union was controlling. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=667.76s)]
*  And history proved us right. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=672.0s)]
*  In 1991, these three proud countries became independent again. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=673.84s)]
*  So there is a difference, generally speaking, between legally saying it is part of another [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=678.88s)]
*  country or just acknowledging the fact that somebody has occupied that territory. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=683.4s)]
*  We want the fighting to stop. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=688.88s)]
*  The world, everybody wants the fighting to stop. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=690.48s)]
*  Russia started it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=692.72s)]
*  There will also be no war. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=693.72s)]
*  Having said that, every two years, Russia will just take a different portion of Eastern [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=695.44s)]
*  Europe back. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=700.2800000000001s)]
*  How far along are you in getting international troops into Ukraine after a ceasefire? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=702.28s)]
*  And what would those countries be? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=720.8s)]
*  Well, let me be absolutely clear. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=722.3199999999999s)]
*  And this is also what President Trump said before, what Pete Hack said, Secretary Hack [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=724.88s)]
*  said before. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=728.6s)]
*  That is that when it comes to a deal on Ukraine, it has to be durable. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=729.7199999999999s)]
*  It has to be lasting. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=734.9599999999999s)]
*  That means that Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, should never ever to try to catch [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=736.04s)]
*  another square mile of Ukraine, let alone try to catch a square mile of NATO territory [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=741.92s)]
*  in the future. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=749.92s)]
*  And that means that he has to understand that when he would try to do that, the reaction [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=750.92s)]
*  will be devastating. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=755.0799999999999s)]
*  That brings you to the question, how to organize that? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=756.68s)]
*  What will security guarantees look like? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=759.76s)]
*  This is all part of the ongoing negotiations. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=761.9599999999999s)]
*  We know that the French and the Brits are very helpful in putting together the ideas [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=764.56s)]
*  and the people to make that happen. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=769.2399999999999s)]
*  And let's hope that we get to that moment soon. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=772.4399999999999s)]
*  I must say, I'm rather optimistic at the moment about President Trump's efforts. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=774.92s)]
*  I think we could get there thanks to his leadership. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=780.68s)]
*  Yeah, I like our side. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=783.1999999999999s)]
*  I just don't trust their side. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=784.72s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thanks so much. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=786.64s)]
*  Always appreciate the time you give us, especially when you come to the states. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xrsCCGRk4&t=788.24s)]
