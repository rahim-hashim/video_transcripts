# Election certification could be delayed as Mike Johnson fights for speakership
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU)
*  back in Washington, House Speaker Mike Johnson's future in his role as the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=0.0s)]
*  speaker could be at risk ahead of a vote next week. And the battle for the gavel [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  could delay the certification of President-elect Trump's victory. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=10.56s)]
*  Madeline Rivera is live in Washington and she's got the tea to spill on this. Maddie? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=14.4s)]
*  Hi guys, good morning. The first order of business for the House when Congress [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=18.6s)]
*  convenes January 3rd is electing a House speaker. It's all about the bath. The [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=22.48s)]
*  House clocks in with 434 members with one vacancy thanks to former Republican [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=26.64s)]
*  Congressman Matt Gaetz. The breakdown is 219 Republicans to 215 Democrats. The [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=31.92s)]
*  speaker of the House must win an outright majority of all members. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=38.24s)]
*  Current speaker Mike Johnson is on thin ice with the right flank of his party [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=41.64s)]
*  after last week's debacle over government spending. Before the last [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  couple of weeks I was you know in his corner but now you know we should we [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=50.88s)]
*  should consider what's the best path forward. We do need to consider whether [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  if we're gonna advance Mr. Trump's agenda whether the current leadership is [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=59.16s)]
*  what we need. Johnson relied on Democrats to get the final funding bill across the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  finish line. It's a similar scenario to 2023 when former House Speaker Kevin [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=66.92s)]
*  McCarthy worked with Democrats to keep the government open. Gaetz then triggered [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=71.24s)]
*  the vote to oust McCarthy. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffery signals Democrats [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=75.84s)]
*  won't be helping Johnson. And there will be no Democrats available to save him or [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=80.32s)]
*  the extreme ag and Republicans from themselves based on the breaching of a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=87.63999999999999s)]
*  bipartisan agreement. Without a speaker the House is paralyzed. It can't swear in [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=93.55999999999999s)]
*  members. It can't pass legislation and here's the kicker. It cannot certify the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=99.24s)]
*  results of the Electoral College on January 6. Todd, Katie and Joey. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=103.44s)]
*  And then Rivera live for us this morning. Maddie thank you. Look when I when I look at this entire [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=110.12s)]
*  situation I don't think anybody here on this couch was excited when Mike Johnson [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=115.08s)]
*  put forward a 1,500 page bill there you know a couple minutes before Christmas [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=120.36s)]
*  and basically told everybody to vote on it. That said I think Republicans have [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  to be very very wary here. They cannot let perfect be the enemy of the good [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  here. And look it's certainly concerning that 1,500 page bill they ultimately did [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=135.04s)]
*  not settle on that but your number one priority in addition to certifying the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  election of Donald Trump is making sure that you do not lose a minute while you [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  have this power to put forward Donald Trump's transformative agenda. All you're [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=152.0s)]
*  guaranteed at the most at this point is two years. You need to take advantage of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=158.04s)]
*  each minute of those two years because who knows what 2026 will bring. Yeah so [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=163.48s)]
*  there are a number of different factors here of course when it comes to the new [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=169.32s)]
*  speaker. The fact is that House Speaker Mike Johnson only has a five seat [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  majority, four seat majority and so if you look at the balance of power here [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=179.32s)]
*  it's a very very slim and so the questions that Republicans and President [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=183.88s)]
*  Donald Trump must be asking is what is the risk-benefit analysis? Is it worth [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=188.2s)]
*  risking not certifying the election of 2024 on January 6 because House [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=193.08s)]
*  Republicans are in fighting about who should be the next speaker? If they're [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=201.0s)]
*  going to do this they should have someone lined up and ready to go to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  replace him immediately because these House Speaker fights can last days, weeks, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  months. And so they're gonna have to decide is it worth pushing off [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=214.12s)]
*  certifying the election potentially pushing through the inauguration date [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=218.24s)]
*  to get a new speaker and whether President Trump you know there's reporting [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=222.4s)]
*  that he's upset with the way that the spending bill went down. However it may [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=227.72000000000003s)]
*  be more complicated given that the certification date is in a week and a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=232.8s)]
*  half. Listen I said yesterday President Trump saved the Republican Party from [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=236.32000000000002s)]
*  the aftermath of the Tea Party. I want to walk down memory lane just for a second [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  explain that. Ted Cruz proved in the Senate when they were the minority that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  you could just complain about everything and not have to be responsible for it [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=247.36s)]
*  and get wildly popular. And that's not a hit at Ted Cruz but that was a strategy [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=250.64s)]
*  that worked. He got a lot of flash, he'd show up to impromptu press conferences [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  places, he showed up at the World War II Memorial after we took down the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  barricades and took credit for that because Barack Obama had shut down the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  memorials over sequestration. And that has parlayed into the Matt Gaetz of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  last year. This idea that you can create a protest not being in the minority but [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=273.88s)]
*  maybe in the minority of your party. Create a protest and kind of the results [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=277.68s)]
*  be damned. Like regardless of how it ends up, over principle I'm gonna take a [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=281.0s)]
*  stand. So they ousted Kevin McCarthy and to their credit Kevin McCarthy did a bad [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=284.96s)]
*  job of not making a deal with Democrats much earlier. That was really his [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=290.04s)]
*  strategic move there that hurt him. They weren't ever gonna pass appropriation [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  bills because of the schedule decalender. And I don't know that Mike Johnson had a [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=297.96000000000004s)]
*  better chance with it this time around. But that is the gripe of Republicans in [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=302.2s)]
*  the House is that we are supposed to pass appropriation bills to fund our [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=306.48s)]
*  government, have those arguments one at a time, not do this continuing resolution [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=310.48s)]
*  that throws in pork at the end. That's a very principled argument. But [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=314.78s)]
*  where is the opportunity or even levers to do something different? Yeah. And that's the problem. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=319.64s)]
*  Not to say that the complaints from the Freedom Caucus and those who are very upset about all this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=325.08s)]
*  And they were all happy to go home. When McCarthy had the hot potato, they [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=329.76s)]
*  were all happy to go home, leave their staff there to negotiate, and then they [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=334.32s)]
*  came back and said we don't like this. This doesn't work. So the deal they made [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=337.92s)]
*  with McCarthy they reneged on, but then the deal that McCarthy made with the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  American people and their members. Well, McCarthy is long gone and Speaker Johnson is currently in powers. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=344.92s)]
*  We'll see if they can find someone better to do the job. We're gonna talk to New York Congresswoman [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=349.2s)]
*  Claudia Tenney in just a few moments on Fox and Friends and certainly we'll ask [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=354.64s)]
*  about this topic. Thomas Massie said he's a no. Hakeem [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=358.8s)]
*  Jeffrey said no Democrats are joining. The math gets a little confusing here for the Republicans. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=361.6s)]
*  Not confusing, just tight. Tight, yeah, yeah. Good point. That's pretty simple. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gsx6KjQdtU&t=366.40000000000003s)]
