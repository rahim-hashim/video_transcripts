# Peter Doocy: Trump is turning things upside down
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0)
*  Meanwhile, while investigators work to find the cause of the deadly DC crash, President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump is ordering a review of DEI and aviation, warning it may have played a role in this [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=4.78s)]
*  tragedy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=10.68s)]
*  Peter Doocy is at the White House with all the details on this story. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=11.68s)]
*  Peter? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=13.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=14.92s)]
*  And President Trump is saying he thinks he inherited a transportation system that was [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=15.92s)]
*  made less safe by the last transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=20.12s)]
*  You know how badly everything's run since he's run the Department of Transportation? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=27.6s)]
*  He's a disaster. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=32.32s)]
*  He was a disaster as a mayor. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=34.6s)]
*  He ran his city into the ground and he's a disaster now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=36.64s)]
*  The Department of Transportation, his government agency charged with regulating civil aviation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=40.88s)]
*  Well, he runs it, 45,000 people, and he's run it right into the ground with his diversity. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=46.72s)]
*  Buttigieg responded to that saying, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=53.44s)]
*  Despicable as families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=55.48s)]
*  We put safety first, drove down close calls, grew air traffic control, and had zero commercial [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=59.76s)]
*  airline crash fatalities out of millions of flights on our watch. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=65.8s)]
*  President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=69.92s)]
*  One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=72.88s)]
*  our skies safe. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=77.22s)]
*  That is something that White House officials dispute. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=78.48s)]
*  You look at this full screen, there have been a lot of changes in federal hiring practices [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=81.84s)]
*  from Trump won to Biden to now Trump too. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=85.84s)]
*  The president is saying though he thinks DEI hiring practices prioritized placing unqualified [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=90.28s)]
*  workers in jobs over safety. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=97.82s)]
*  You even yet know the names of the 67 people who were killed and you are blaming Democrats [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=101.04s)]
*  and DEI policies and air traffic control. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=107.8s)]
*  Don't you think you're getting ahead of the investigation right now? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=110.6s)]
*  No, I don't think so at all. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=112.6s)]
*  I don't think with the names of the people, you mean the names of the people that are [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  on the plane. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  You think that's going to make a difference? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=119.72s)]
*  Does it comfort their families? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  They are a group of people that have lost their lives. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  If you want a list of the names, we can give you that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=125.32s)]
*  We'll be giving that very soon. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=127.56s)]
*  In coordination with American Airlines, we're in coordination very strongly, obviously with [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=129.24s)]
*  the military. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=133.44s)]
*  But I think that's not a very smart question. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=134.76s)]
*  President Trump knows more about the players involved in this mid-air collision than we [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=138.5s)]
*  do and we just don't know exactly right now what he knows about the players involved that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=144.26s)]
*  is helping him reach this conclusion that he thinks that DEI practices contributed to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=149.78s)]
*  what happened. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=155.86s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=156.86s)]
*  Hey, Peter, were you astounded by the level of communication? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=157.86s)]
*  I mean, must have, I was blown away. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=160.18s)]
*  We don't normally see the president in the briefing room. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=162.22s)]
*  And cabinet members. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=164.38s)]
*  The Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Transportation. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=165.38s)]
*  The vice president. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=166.38s)]
*  NTSP, who is amazing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=167.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, yeah, and it took us three and a half years to get Joe Biden into the briefing room [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=169.66s)]
*  for any reason. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=174.18s)]
*  And it was after he was already, he had already said that he wasn't going to run for anything [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=175.18s)]
*  anymore. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=180.78s)]
*  But President Trump wants to, and it's not just because this happened pretty much literally [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=181.78s)]
*  in his backyard, like within view of his balcony from the White House residence. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=187.1s)]
*  He just is showing us that he wants to have his fingerprints on every big national story. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=192.24s)]
*  And this is something that he and his team, Sean Duffy and Pete Hegseth, their first hours [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=199.52s)]
*  on the job are going to have to deal with immediately to make people feel safe. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=206.0s)]
*  And it is a change. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=211.4s)]
*  I think the way that this used to work for the last couple of years, we would probably [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=212.60000000000002s)]
*  get a lot of lower level communication staffers briefing us, doing a telephone background [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=217.12s)]
*  briefing, something on Zoom where we can't show their faces or use their names, but we [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=223.28s)]
*  can say we got information on background. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=227.28s)]
*  Whereas Trump is doing it essentially upside down. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=229.76s)]
*  Start with the people at the top. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=232.6s)]
*  This guy's in charge of the Pentagon. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  This guy's in charge of the Transportation Department. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=235.56s)]
*  I am the commander in chief. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=238.12s)]
*  This is what we think. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=239.86s)]
*  And so and now they are going to let us know in real time what they're going to do. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=241.32s)]
*  It will let you do a story and actually complete it by six o'clock. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=247.16s)]
*  Well yeah, if your job is to cover what the president says, it helps a lot if the president [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  says a lot. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=258.16s)]
*  Something. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=259.16s)]
*  Thanks, Peter, for bringing that down. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=260.16s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=262.52s)]
*  Peter was talking about DEI and we heard the president saying that might be an issue here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=263.52s)]
*  The FAA launched a national outreach program under Obama for DEI and it included a push [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=268.0s)]
*  to hire workers with severe intellectual disabilities and psychiatric problems. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=273.26s)]
*  There's also a lawsuit from last year, 2024, that alleged that the FAA turned away nearly [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=278.58s)]
*  a thousand air traffic controller applicants solely based on race. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=283.98s)]
*  That is insane to be low on people and a high impact job and to turn people away. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=289.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, go ahead, bro. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=295.82s)]
*  I was going to say that Troy and Nails was on with you earlier and he said this about [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=298.14s)]
*  the air traffic controller situation. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=303.58s)]
*  Keep in mind the federal government's running the Reagan Airport. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=305.34s)]
*  Watch the DCA, which is the Reagan Airport where this took place. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  Their air traffic control staffing shows that they need 30 personnel to operate that air [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=312.97999999999996s)]
*  traffic control tower. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=319.78s)]
*  It's a very busy airport. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=320.78s)]
*  They say there are about 19 currently on staff. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  So we have a staffing issue at the Reagan Airport, DCA. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=325.24s)]
*  DCA, very busy airport. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=329.8s)]
*  We have 800 flights inbound and outbound each and every day at Reagan Airport. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=331.8s)]
*  And overall, I believe our record, our safety record is the gold standard. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=337.64s)]
*  But when we have an issue like this, it needs to be addressed. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=341.8s)]
*  There needs to be some oversight from Congress. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=344.6s)]
*  We need to make sure that if these airports are struggling with air traffic controllers, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=346.92s)]
*  they bring it to our attention and we can try to encourage more younger people to get [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=352.52s)]
*  into that field. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=356.79999999999995s)]
*  I struggle with this DEI stuff. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=359.46s)]
*  I covered DEI when I ran campus reform. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=361.65999999999997s)]
*  Maybe it had the original intent was good, but it's gone way too far. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=364.94s)]
*  I understand organic diversity. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  I understand that some people at one point in time in history or maybe today were denied [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  jobs because they're qualified, because of the race, sexual orientation or whatever. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=376.76s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=381.2s)]
*  But why are we trying to get people with mental disabilities to work air traffic control? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=382.8s)]
*  I mean, there is a place for them in society, but a lot of the diversity push just doesn't make sense. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=389.84s)]
*  It's not a value of diversity in air traffic control. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=396.8s)]
*  It just doesn't. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=400.76s)]
*  The one thing that we need to focus on is the person qualified for the job. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=402.08s)]
*  Does their diverse background bring them some additional information to the job? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=406.32s)]
*  But just hiring people to meet different metrics doesn't make any sense to me. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=410.56s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=415.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=416.04s)]
*  The last thing I would say reminds me of the story we had the LA fires where that fire chief [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=417.04s)]
*  was saying we want people to know that if you're in a fire, there's somebody coming [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=420.92s)]
*  to save you that looks like you. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=425.92s)]
*  No, I'd like somebody that's good at saving people. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=427.36s)]
*  I just don't want to burn. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=429.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=430.16s)]
*  I just don't want to burn. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=431.16s)]
*  I want to live. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=432.16s)]
*  I don't want to burn to death. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=433.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=436.24s)]
*  So NBC has a story and the headline is fear and chaos grip federal workers as Trump rapidly [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=437.24s)]
*  remakes the government. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump has said, as you know, we've been covering this. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=445.52000000000004s)]
*  He wants to end the work from home practices. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=447.6s)]
*  So he offered the deferred resignation where you get paid through September if you resign [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=450.44000000000005s)]
*  by February 6. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=455.24s)]
*  There are only 6% of our federal workers that are working full time in an office. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=456.72s)]
*  So that's why Donald Trump is doing this. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=461.0s)]
*  Now you have these Democrats that are saying we're living in fear. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=462.72s)]
*  We're everything so chaotic. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=466.0s)]
*  But my question to them is are you fearful about lower prices? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=467.88s)]
*  Are you fearful about tax breaks? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=471.06s)]
*  Are you fearful about not paying tips, not paying taxes on tips or Social Security checks [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=472.76s)]
*  or on your overtime? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=477.84s)]
*  Many of you work overtime. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=478.84s)]
*  Are you fearful that Donald Trump's going to get rid of criminal illegal aliens? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=480.38s)]
*  Why are you scared? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=484.56s)]
*  And they're worried about the if you're a federal employee, they're worried about their [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=485.56s)]
*  future. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=488.8s)]
*  Well, because Donald Trump has Elon Musk to cut two trillion out of the budget. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=489.8s)]
*  They accused Donald Trump of the first four years of not cutting like he did. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=495.28s)]
*  Tax reform, I believe, was working to do that, bring more revenue in. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=499.14s)]
*  But they never got to the tax cut because of the pandemic. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=503.44s)]
*  So what he's doing now is to look at the 2.3 million people working for the federal government. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=506.34s)]
*  They all got emails saying you can quit. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=510.7s)]
*  We'll give you six months, which by the way is way too generous, I think. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=512.88s)]
*  But come to work, you're fired or take the six months just right in your subject line, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=516.68s)]
*  say resigning. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=522.12s)]
*  So that you should feel feel loathing if you're not doing a good job. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=523.64s)]
*  But if you like your job and are doing good at your job, you can keep your job. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=526.6800000000001s)]
*  But this is part of a whole of government push to lean it out and bring up budget in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=531.0s)]
*  line with $36 trillion in debt. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=535.88s)]
*  You should not be fearful unless you're coasting. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=538.34s)]
*  If you're coasting in your job, be fearful. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=541.64s)]
*  But this is the one must sleeping in the Eisenhower boy in the office on the couch like he did [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=544.4s)]
*  with Tesla trying to fix it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=550.48s)]
*  He's trying to fix the government the way he did SpaceX. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=553.72s)]
*  Something is obviously going wrong. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=556.6s)]
*  We just had Americans die because it wasn't properly staffed and they weren't focusing [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=558.24s)]
*  on the right thing. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=563.6s)]
*  Other agencies are going through something similar. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=565.38s)]
*  It's just not a harsh job or a deadly job that could cause death. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=568.24s)]
*  But other harms are happening in the government currently. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  It's sad we had to figure it all out this way. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LBWnNNz0&t=575.12s)]
