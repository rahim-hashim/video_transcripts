# Panic sets in on left as Trump term nears
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk)
*  From deportations to his tough talk on the global stage, the left is already [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=0.0s)]
*  trying to put put down President-elect Trump's policies. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=4.8s)]
*  What we saw today with Tom Homan is fear-mongering. It's telling all of us [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=8.8s)]
*  that we should be on alert. The question we have to ask ourselves is what will [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=14.16s)]
*  this mass deportation policy ask of us? What will we have to concede to and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=18.72s)]
*  So it's going to be Panama Canal this week or next and then the weeks thereafter it will be another pet project of the billionaire class. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=26.04s)]
*  It's a very Putin-esque thing to make these grandiose claims. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=35.04s)]
*  Given the Putin-esque sort of language that's being used here, one wonders like really how far actually would he go? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=39.379999999999995s)]
*  These kinds of insults, you know, could provoke them into a confrontation with the United States. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=46.84s)]
*  Pulsar Lee Carter is president of Maslansky and Partners. She joins us now. Lee, good morning. Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=53.6s)]
*  You literally have your hand or your eyes on the dial of how Americans react to things like this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=59.6s)]
*  On one hand you have Trump's true social posts that are bombastic and then on the other hand you have this left reaction that is probably over the top. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  Which one of those is winning in the competition of Americans' opinions? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, Americans are more optimistic than they have been in the last four years and we're seeing in polling that people are excited about what Trump is going to do. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=80.36s)]
*  And these kinds of reactions by the media to Donald Trump only embolden his support. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=89.36s)]
*  What we're seeing, and we saw this all throughout the election cycle, the more you attack him, the more you call him a dictator, the more you call him Putin-esque, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=95.36s)]
*  the more you use these kinds of phrases, the more people support him. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=103.36s)]
*  People want Donald Trump to be tough on the global stage. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=107.12s)]
*  When you talk to voters out there, they're excited about what he might do on the Panama Canal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=111.12s)]
*  They're excited about what he might do, not afraid of it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=115.12s)]
*  And what all of this does is make people feel like they're very much, the media is very much out of touch with the concerns of the American people. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=119.12s)]
*  I think when we look at this tweet that he put out yesterday, and the narrative for the last couple of weeks of this, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=128.88s)]
*  Greenland and Panama and how he's treating Canada and Mexico, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=133.88s)]
*  I think maybe people inside the Beltway and on channels that talk about politics are getting in the weeds. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=137.88s)]
*  But don't most Americans feel that as, wow, look at this just a position of how are we going to make it to we're doing so well we can expand what we're doing? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=143.88s)]
*  There's such a huge gap between what the hardworking American people do and then the ruling class believe. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=153.64s)]
*  And it is widening and it just makes the voter feel or the average American person feel that the ruling class or the media or the liberal elite are completely out of touch with their concerns. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=163.64s)]
*  And they very much feel that Donald Trump is going to fight for them. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=178.64s)]
*  When you look at the polling, more than 78% of Americans feel that Donald Trump is going to fight for their interests. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  And they don't feel the same about the liberal elite. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  Is it changing at all now that different people are being nominated? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  You see these fights on social media where people are saying, well, that's too liberal of a cabinet. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  That's too radical of a person for that position. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  It might be in the weeds of just my feed that's curated to me, but are you seeing Americans react in that way? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  Because Donald Trump threw a huge tent this time around and brought in people from kind of all walks of the political spectrum. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=210.16s)]
*  When you want to hate someone, you're going to find ways to hate them. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=218.16s)]
*  When you want to have hope, you're going to find ways to have hope. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=223.16s)]
*  And what's happening through this whole cabinet process is very much a mirror image of what people see already. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=226.16s)]
*  So if they hated Donald Trump, they're hating every one of these candidates that's been put forth. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=233.16s)]
*  If they have hope that Donald Trump is going to bring a better American future, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=239.92s)]
*  they are hopeful that these candidates are the right ones to fill out the cabinet. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=243.92s)]
*  Many people are excited by the variety of folks that are coming in. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=248.92s)]
*  Many people are enthusiastic. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=253.44s)]
*  There's certainly some people who are afraid. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=255.64s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=257.92s)]
*  But the way that you view that is very much filtered through the lens of how you felt about Donald Trump to begin with. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think people sit at home and they see what happens in D.C. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=267.88s)]
*  You have Republicans on the Hill right now fighting to their own demise. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=270.88s)]
*  You have Democrats in a place that they don't know where to go from here. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=274.88s)]
*  Is Donald Trump really severed from that? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=277.88s)]
*  I know he's his on brand, but in politics, is he a completely separate entity from the two parties? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=280.88s)]
*  In many ways he is. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=288.88s)]
*  When you look at the polling about do you think Republicans are going to fight for you or versus Democrats are going to fight for you, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=290.88s)]
*  it's not all that different. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=297.24s)]
*  But when you think about Donald Trump, it is very different. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=298.24s)]
*  So he sort of rises above the brand. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=301.24s)]
*  He represents the Republican Party, but he is himself his own personality. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=303.24s)]
*  And I think a lot of people are concerned about what the future of the Republican Party is without Donald Trump, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=308.24s)]
*  because he is so much of what people think about the party itself. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=314.24s)]
*  But I do think that there's a disconnect. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=321.24s)]
*  When people think about government, when they think about Congress, when they think about how the parties themselves, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=323.6s)]
*  it's not necessarily the same as Donald Trump. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=328.6s)]
*  Donald Trump actually gets a much more favorable opinion than the party itself. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=331.6s)]
*  Well, he's on his way in. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=335.6s)]
*  Let's hope that the favorability stays up because he's doing things that we like. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=336.6s)]
*  Lee Carter, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=340.6s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=342.6s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=343.6s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3Hx5CEKxk&t=344.6s)]
