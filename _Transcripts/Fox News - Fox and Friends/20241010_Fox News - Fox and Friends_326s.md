# Bill Hemmer: This was sinister
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070)
*  Well, Hurricane Milton left a path of damage across the state of Florida as you look live [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=0.0s)]
*  in downtown Orlando. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=8.8s)]
*  Yeah, America's newsroom co-anchor Bill Hemmer joins us live from Orlando with the latest. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=10.8s)]
*  Hey Bill, what are you seeing? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=16.28s)]
*  Hey guys, good morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  We have power. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=20.44s)]
*  I had power pretty much throughout the entire night, which is a really good sign for the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=21.44s)]
*  people here in Orlando. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=24.6s)]
*  I really think the main question is what happens here coming up at about 830 Eastern Time. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=26.439999999999998s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis is going to be out. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=31.96s)]
*  Also the city officials in Tampa are going to be out. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Why is that important? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=35.8s)]
*  We have yet to get an assessment, guys, of the barrier islands on the west coast of Florida. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=37.28s)]
*  That was where the eye wall slammed into places like Sarasota and Sarasota County. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=42.36s)]
*  You've got Longbow Key and Siesta Key and Venice down to Boca Grande and Sanibel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=47.96s)]
*  If you remember a place called Pine Island about two years ago, there was a hurricane [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=53.16s)]
*  that took out the bridge that led out to Pine Island. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=57.48s)]
*  And Governor DeSantis, remember the time now, he was getting ready for a primary race for [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  the Republican nomination. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=64.84s)]
*  And there was a prediction that that bridge would take two months to repair and they got [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=67.92s)]
*  it open within two weeks' time. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=71.24s)]
*  Well, late last night when we were reporting here on the air in Orlando, we were given [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=72.96s)]
*  indication that bridge had been knocked out again, to what extent we do not know. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=76.67999999999999s)]
*  But no reporters have been able to get out to these barrier islands. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=80.6s)]
*  So we really do not have an assessment just yet about how they survived through the night. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=83.88s)]
*  That's going to be key number one. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=89.16s)]
*  Key number two is going to be down in St. Lucie County. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=90.8s)]
*  If you were to go about 120 miles to the southeast from where we are in Atlanta, there is a mobile [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=93.56s)]
*  home community for seniors that got hit with tornadoes yesterday afternoon. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=100.0s)]
*  You know, that leading band of the storm was massive. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=104.8s)]
*  When you get ready for the direction of the storm, everybody watches where the eye is [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=108.74s)]
*  going and you try and make a projection. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=113.25999999999999s)]
*  This eye was coming west to east. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  The area I'm now describing in St. Lucie is on the other side of the state. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=118.41999999999999s)]
*  And we had more than 100 tornado warnings yesterday afternoon. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=123.58s)]
*  Yes, you get tornadoes with hurricanes, but it's two or three or five, maybe. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=127.46s)]
*  But more than 100 in one day is extraordinary. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=132.8s)]
*  I have to check with our meteorologist at Fox Weather. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=135.3s)]
*  That might be a record for a storm like this. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=138.86s)]
*  So I keep an eye on St. Lucie and when these officials brief after we have daylight here, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  now breaking in Florida to find out what's happening on those islands that I described [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=148.02s)]
*  a moment ago. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=151.38000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=152.38000000000002s)]
*  And Bill, we're looking live at some flooding there in the Orlando area. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=153.38000000000002s)]
*  Right now, screen right, somebody who can obviously see the bottom. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=156.78s)]
*  One of the things about Florida is they really prepare ahead of time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=161.14000000000001s)]
*  They flew in generators. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=164.8s)]
*  They got Starlink satellite systems. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=166.36s)]
*  They now do those aqua fences around critical infrastructure like hospitals and electric [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=169.12s)]
*  infrastructure so that floodwaters don't knock them out. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=175.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great point, Steve. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=179.8s)]
*  And that's part of the preparation the governor put into this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  He's got a lot of experience doing it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  I think before the hurricane season began, he told his state to get ready for seven direct [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=186.56s)]
*  hits to get ready for seven hits. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=191.12s)]
*  Florida went 10 years without a hurricane, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=195.08s)]
*  It was 20 years ago this summer, this fall, I should say, where you had three hurricanes [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=197.84s)]
*  in the span of about six weeks. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=203.3s)]
*  It was the summer fall of 2004 and I think it was Charlie and Gene and Francis that crisscrossed [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=205.8s)]
*  the state, all coming east to west. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=212.96s)]
*  The storm came from the other direction, west to east, which is exceedingly rare. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=215.84s)]
*  I think the Santas yesterday said they have pre-positioned 20,000 electric teams and members [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=219.64s)]
*  to be ready to attack this storm. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=227.64s)]
*  And it's going to be a big job getting the power back. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=229.84s)]
*  You can see the video. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=232.32s)]
*  I mean, lines are down everywhere. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=233.32s)]
*  And again, we'll wait and see what happens on the west coast, Steve. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=234.84s)]
*  Bill, what do you expect that he'll hear from the governor during this press conference? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=238.0s)]
*  My expectation is that he'll have a pretty good handle on where the hardest hit area is. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=245.2s)]
*  I'm very familiar with Florida. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=253.32s)]
*  I'm especially familiar with the west coast of Florida. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=254.76s)]
*  The way the state grew, air conditioning came first, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=257.8s)]
*  And then you had the interstates. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=262.36s)]
*  And on the east coast, it was I-95, so all the folks in New York and New Jersey went [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=263.96s)]
*  to the east coast of Florida. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=268.56s)]
*  But all the Midwesterners went down interstate 75, down where it used to end, in the city [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=270.38s)]
*  of Tampa. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=275.62s)]
*  And so all the Midwesterners now are on a lot of these islands that I mentioned a moment [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=276.62s)]
*  ago, like holding their breath throughout the night to find out whether or not is my [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  property going to be okay. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  We spoke with a woman. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=286.3s)]
*  We did a show late last night, guys. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=287.3s)]
*  And her name was Ashley. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=289.38s)]
*  She was in Sarasota. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=291.82s)]
*  She and her husband chose to stay. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=292.82s)]
*  They had a hurricane-proof shutter, she said, that helped protect her house. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=294.78000000000003s)]
*  But she was on with us. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=298.02s)]
*  It was pitch dark inside of her home. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=299.78000000000003s)]
*  And she was very concerned with the sounds that she heard outside, which is another thing [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=303.1s)]
*  that was a little sinister about this storm. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=307.66s)]
*  It hit in the dark of night. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=311.62s)]
*  And when all you have are your ears, as your best sensation, the mind kind of does some [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=314.06s)]
*  strange things with imagination. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=320.62s)]
*  And we're going to be left to find out what the reality is here very soon. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJrbJdq3070&t=322.7s)]
