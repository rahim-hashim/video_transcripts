# A judge is 'usurping' Trump's authority, Jarrett warns: 'You cannot make this up'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8)
*  The Trump administration has until tonight to comply with a judge's order to bring a Salvadoran national and accused MS-13 gang member back to the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=0.0s)]
*  But Attorney General Pam Bondi standing up to criticism and justifying their decision to put a federal attorney on leave over the case. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=10.0s)]
*  So we have to rely on what ICE says. We have to rely on what Homeland Security says. They're our clients. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=19.0s)]
*  And I firmly believe in the work they are doing. I firmly said on day one I issued a memo that you are to vigorously advocate on behalf of the United States. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=24.0s)]
*  Our client in this matter was Homeland Security, is Homeland Security. He did not argue. He shouldn't have taken the case. He shouldn't have argued it if that's what he was going to do. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=35.0s)]
*  He's on administrative leave now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=44.0s)]
*  Here now is Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett. Great to see you this morning, Greg. Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=47.0s)]
*  So this is a really bizarre case here where you have you actually have a situation where you have a judge basically ordering the president to negotiate with a foreign government to return a foreign national to the United States. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=52.0s)]
*  Yeah. And Charlie, you know, a U.S. federal judge has no authority to tell El Salvador what to do. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=70.0s)]
*  Nor does this judge have jurisdiction over a person held outside the U.S. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=79.0s)]
*  Notwithstanding, Paula Zinnis is her name, Obama appointee, is anointing herself as the super president of the United States and ordering Trump to negotiate his return, Garcia's return, which is an intrusion on a president's power under Article 2 of the Constitution to conduct foreign affairs, enforce all laws, including immigration laws. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=84.0s)]
*  So I think this is yet another example of an unelected judge usurping authority of the chief executive and shredding the separation of powers. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=110.0s)]
*  In this question, Charlie, whether Garcia is a member of MS 13, which is a designated terror group that was already resolved six years ago. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=120.0s)]
*  An immigration judge held a hearing examined the incriminating evidence and said, yeah, he is. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=130.0s)]
*  But because he's a dangerous gang member, he gets to stay free in the U.S. or he'd be killed by a rival gang if returned El Salvador. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=136.0s)]
*  I mean, you cannot make this up. We are apparently now in the business of protecting members of murderous gangs from other murderous gangs. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=147.0s)]
*  Truly extraordinary. I want to switch topics to to this. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=158.0s)]
*  There's a fundraiser was held for Texas football star Austin Metcalf's accused killer raking in some hundred and twenty thousand dollars as he claims self-defense. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=162.0s)]
*  As we understand it, obviously, you know, this is at this point, we don't know all of the details. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=174.0s)]
*  Courts have not ruled on this. But as we understand it right now, the accused killer got pushed or got hands on from Metcalf, takes a knife out of his bag and stabs him in the heart. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=179.0s)]
*  What do you make of all this? Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=194.0s)]
*  Well, claim of self-defense won't work here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=197.0s)]
*  He admits, as you say, stabbing a football player who allegedly told him to move off a bench or may or may not have grabbed him. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=200.0s)]
*  Well, guess what? The law doesn't allow you to use deadly force, stabbing somebody in the heart with a knife simply because somebody touches you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=207.0s)]
*  I mean, there has to be imminent fear of death or serious bodily injury and, you know, touching. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=217.0s)]
*  I think it's understandable, though, the public outrage over this online fundraising site for the accused killer. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=224.0s)]
*  It is so reminiscent, you put the graphic up of the case of Luigi Mangione, you allegedly assassinated a health care executive. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=230.0s)]
*  The swell of praise and adoration for deadly vigilanteism is disgusting, to say the least. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=238.0s)]
*  And as a result, some but not all of his fundraising sites were yanked. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=247.0s)]
*  And I think it's important, I'm sure you agree, Charlie, that websites need to adopt rules against supporting violent acts. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=253.0s)]
*  Otherwise, what you're doing is implicitly condoning violence and encouraging more of it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=262.0s)]
*  Truly and truly, truly disturbing. Thank you so much, Greg. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=269.0s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=274.0s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=277.0s)]
*  And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH8hm17LkL8&t=278.0s)]
