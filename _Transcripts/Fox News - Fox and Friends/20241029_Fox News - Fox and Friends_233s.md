# Gubernatorial candidate makes bold prediction Trump will this flip blue state
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU)
*  Early voting underway in New Jersey and a record 850,000 voters. They have already returned their ballots [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrats have a commanding lead in the mail in results [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=6.84s)]
*  But the in-person results are a statistical tie Jack Chittarelli running for governor in New Jersey next year after flipping several counties [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=9.64s)]
*  I'm losing by just two points in 2021 and Jack joins me now sir great to see as always [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=17.56s)]
*  Conventional wisdom is that Donald Trump is not going to win New Jersey because it is a blue state [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=22.28s)]
*  He's not going to win other blue states as a conventional wisdom as well [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=26.84s)]
*  But why do you say it's so important for Republicans in these blue states to turn out and vote? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=30.04s)]
*  despite the conventional wisdom I [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Think we proved back in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=40.64s)]
*  2021 Todd and you mentioned it New Jersey is not a deep blue state [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=42.4s)]
*  We can win here and and I do think Donald Trump's going to do that as well as our US Senate candidate our congressional [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=46.96s)]
*  Candidates and many of our local candidates so and what we're seeing is phenomenal [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=53.199999999999996s)]
*  Republicans are finally embracing the opportunity to vote early the return rate on vote by mail ballots has been fantastic [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=57.72s)]
*  local Republican [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=64.2s)]
*  Organizations are doing a great job and getting the word out so I'm excited by what we're gonna see come Election Day [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=65.64s)]
*  It's a bold statement Jack for you to sit here on national television and say [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=71.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to win the state of New Jersey along with the Republican Senate candidate [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=74.64s)]
*  So what are you seeing on the ground as you campaign as you talk to the voters? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=79.54s)]
*  Especially in those what you would consider normally Democrat areas to lead you to a conclusion like that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=83.9s)]
*  Well, what makes me say that first of all is that Kamala Harris has taken New Jersey for granted [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=90.74s)]
*  She hasn't campaigned here. Not once in fact recently [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=94.94s)]
*  She had an event that she landed in one of our local airports only to go over to board to Pennsylvania [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=98.3s)]
*  Didn't even stop to shake hands here in New Jersey. Donald Trump had a big rally here earlier in the year [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=103.18s)]
*  He's had fundraisers here and there's just great energy on the ground for him and people have had it with what's going on around [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=108.06s)]
*  The country so I'm excited about the opportunity and again the turnout [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=113.22s)]
*  We're really excited about with Republicans finally embracing early voting [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=117.02s)]
*  So that's all a good sign and when I talk to people on the ground people in line [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=121.14s)]
*  I was on line yesterday for about a half hour [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=124.94s)]
*  Those are people that are coming out to vote Republican based upon what you were seeing [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=127.02s)]
*  Do you think Trump could win the national popular vote? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  What because of the population in places like California, New York [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=135.84s)]
*  We know that that's the greatest challenge, but it's all about the electoral college and there's the real opportunity [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=138.68s)]
*  So I'm excited. I think he's done a great job of going to all the swing states and not taking any state for granted [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=143.48s)]
*  As I said for for Kamala Harris not to come to New Jersey [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=149.92s)]
*  Even when she's landed a local airport that says she's taking the state for granted and we saw what happened when Phil Murphy did that back in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=154.12s)]
*  It was pretty close in 2021 and I think as part and parcel of why you're saying hey [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  Let me give it another shot next year [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  We have an election coming up in a week that we're gonna focus on first and then we'll get to your race before we let [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  You go in light of that narrow defeat back in 2021 [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=171.88s)]
*  What is your message to the Republican voter in New Jersey in Connecticut in New York in California? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=175.16s)]
*  Who says why even bother my votes not gonna matter because you know in all likelihood the Democrats gonna win [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  What is your message to that person watching right now Jack? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=187.4s)]
*  This has never mattered more Todd and people have to fulfill their civic responsibility to get out there and vote every vote does count [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=191.68s)]
*  I mean when you look what's gone on around the country over the last four years what we see on the border [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  The lawlessness in the community the price of groceries a diminished role for the country around the globe a lack of support for law enforcement [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=203.32s)]
*  Those are all reasons to get out there and vote and what I say to people is be really careful about the people that are watching [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=211.24s)]
*  You really want change you've got to make a change vote Republican give us a shot [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=217.48s)]
*  53 weeks from now. We'll probably be talking to you again about your race in New Jersey, but for now Jack [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  Thanks for coming on and talking about next week's huge huge election Jack Chittarelli. Thanks for your time [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwi4Hw65QmU&t=227.12s)]
