# Peter Doocy: Why was this done secretly?
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE)
*  To a Fox News alert, President Biden, in an 11th hour move, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=0.0s)]
*  announced he unleashed 11 Gitmo detainees [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=3.34s)]
*  captured in the aftermath of 9-11 terror attacks [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=6.0s)]
*  are now being transferred out of the U.S. to Oman. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=12.08s)]
*  joins us with the details. Hey, Peter. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=13.88s)]
*  And if President Biden is trying to deliver on his public promise [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=19.52s)]
*  we're not sure why this transfer was made. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=22.02s)]
*  In secret, 11 Yemeni detainees sent to Oman [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=24.36s)]
*  rehabilitated, at least according to the DOD [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=28.66s)]
*  that is now telling us in a statement [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=31.06s)]
*  the United States appreciates the willingness [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=32.5s)]
*  of the government of Oman and other partners [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=35.04s)]
*  to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=37.58s)]
*  responsibly reducing the detainee population [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=40.54s)]
*  and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=43.58s)]
*  Of the two Bin Laden bodyguards that were just let go, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=47.18s)]
*  one of them, Ahmed al-Ali, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  still had an extremist mindset as recently as 2016, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=52.68s)]
*  according to declassified files. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=56.580000000000005s)]
*  The other one, Anam al-Sharabi, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=58.68s)]
*  may have been linked to a hijacking plot in Asia. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=60.82s)]
*  But ultimately, these 11 guys spent more than 20 years [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=63.86s)]
*  in prison without ever being charged. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=67.16s)]
*  And a lawyer for two of them is quoted by the New York Times [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=69.10000000000001s)]
*  as saying they want to live their lives. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=72.5s)]
*  They want to get married. They want to have kids. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=75.0s)]
*  They want to get a job and have normal lives. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=77.04s)]
*  At one point, there were about 800 prisoners in Gitmo. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=79.88s)]
*  Now it's down to 15. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=82.38s)]
*  And recent estimates put the cost at about $13 million [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=84.46s)]
*  per prisoner per year. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=87.66s)]
*  So even if Joe Biden fails in his promise to close [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=89.0s)]
*  Gitmo for good, emptying it out like this [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=91.6s)]
*  puts a lot of pressure on his successors to close it [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  if for no other reason than it's becoming too expensive. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=96.94s)]
*  And we have some breaking news about one of the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=99.98s)]
*  remaining 15 prisoners. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=102.18s)]
*  His name is Rahim al-Afghani. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=103.97999999999999s)]
*  And according to the Wall Street Journal [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=107.68s)]
*  and an item that is crossing right now, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=109.12s)]
*  the Biden administration has had negotiators [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=111.0s)]
*  in Doha, Qatar negotiating with the Taliban [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=113.44s)]
*  about a possible trade for Mr. al-Afghani [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=116.72s)]
*  for three Americans that the Biden administration [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=120.48s)]
*  believes are held by the Taliban right now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=124.02s)]
*  Wow. So we might exchange Gitmo guys [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=128.1s)]
*  for two of our guys in Afghanistan. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=130.8s)]
*  And this was a senior Al-Qaeda leader [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=133.9s)]
*  who has been held for years. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=138.04s)]
*  And so this is a big gut check for president Biden. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=139.4s)]
*  How badly does he want to really get the population [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=141.96s)]
*  of Gitmo down? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=144.26s)]
*  Is it worth trading, releasing a senior Al-Qaeda leader? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=145.1s)]
*  Well, we know those two leaders that Obama left [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=150.9s)]
*  went right back to leading the Taliban. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=152.44s)]
*  They went to the battlefields [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=154.54s)]
*  and these guys would do the same thing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=155.38s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=157.7s)]
*  Thank you, Peter. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=159.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  So he's just burning it down. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=160.9s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=163.38s)]
*  He's just burning the house down on the way out. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=164.22s)]
*  Well, and he has said, you know, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=166.22s)]
*  we never leave people over there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=168.28s)]
*  So maybe that's part of his calculus [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=169.86s)]
*  on why he's doing it now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLzbfyxQDE&t=172.42000000000002s)]
