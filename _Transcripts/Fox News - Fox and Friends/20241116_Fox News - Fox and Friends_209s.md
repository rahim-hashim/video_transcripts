# Georgia AG Chris Carr: ‘The system failed Laken Riley’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4)
*  The trial of the illegal immigrant accused of killing Georgia nursing student Lakin Riley starts back up Monday after the prosecution's opening statements. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=0.0s)]
*  He went hunting for females on the University of Georgia's campus. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=10.0s)]
*  When Lakin Riley refused to be his rape victim, he bashed her skull in with a rock. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=15.0s)]
*  The evidence will show that Lakin fought. She fought for her life. She fought for her dignity. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=26.0s)]
*  But new evidence from a doorbell camera shows the suspect throwing his jacket into a dumpster and gloves into a bush. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=38.0s)]
*  Both of those had Lakin Riley's DNA on them. Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr joins us now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=45.0s)]
*  Good morning Attorney General. I'm sure you're following this case closely. What are your thoughts after the first day of trial? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=52.0s)]
*  Well, good morning and thank you for having me on. My thoughts are this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=59.0s)]
*  This is a case that has really struck the nerve, not just in Athens, Georgia, not just in our state, but around the country. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=63.0s)]
*  You know, I'm a father that actually has a 20-year-old daughter at the University of Georgia right now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=72.0s)]
*  And when you hear the evidence, and by the way, Sheila Ross is an excellent prosecutor, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=78.0s)]
*  but when you hear the evidence that she fought for her life, she fought for her dignity, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=83.0s)]
*  like you just played, that he was out hunting for women on the University of Georgia campus, it breaks your heart. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=89.0s)]
*  But it also makes you ask the question, why are we even here? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=96.0s)]
*  And we're here because the system failed Lakin Riley and her family. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=100.0s)]
*  A broken border, a failed Lakin Riley. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=105.0s)]
*  You know, police in New York City failed Lakin Riley, and same with the sanctuary cities here in Athens, Georgia. They failed her. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=109.0s)]
*  Yeah, I want to ask about this. I live not far from Lakin's family, and I don't live far from Athens either. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=117.0s)]
*  And so I want to ask you about this. They didn't ask for, or they didn't seek the death penalty. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=123.0s)]
*  I know that the defense is saying that the evidence is circumstantial. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=129.0s)]
*  From my understanding, the only thing not circumstantial would be a witness, and you don't usually have that or don't always have that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=133.0s)]
*  Why not seek the death penalty, and are there politics at play in that? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=139.0s)]
*  Well, that's a great question, and that's a question that would have to be directed to the district attorney that now lost the race in Athens and Clark County. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=144.0s)]
*  But I'll say this. Coming out of 2020, on the left, the new criminal justice reform was just non-enforced laws that you didn't like and have policies that really coddled criminals. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=154.0s)]
*  I think that's a question that is better asked for the district attorney. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=166.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, Lakin Riley and her family deserve justice. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=170.0s)]
*  This prosecutor, Sheila Ross, is outstanding. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=175.0s)]
*  I am confident that the case that they're going to put on is going to be one that is going to deliver that hope and that promise to Lakin and her family. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=178.0s)]
*  Absolutely. I know that I've talked to her stepdad. Making her memory and legacy means something matter. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=186.0s)]
*  And one of the ways to do that is to set an example of how Georgia will treat these heinous crimes. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=191.0s)]
*  Attorney General Chris Carr, thank you for joining us. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=196.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQ_RhzouH4&t=208.0s)]
