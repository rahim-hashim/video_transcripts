# Trump calls USPS ‘tremendous loser,’ floats merging it with commerce department
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY)
*  And President Trump eyeing another, yet another major government shake up as he sets his sights on the US Postal Service. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=0.0s)]
*  Madeline Rivera is live in Washington with all the details. Good morning, Maddie. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=7.5s)]
*  Hi guys, good morning. President Trump has long mused about privatizing the Postal Service. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=11.3s)]
*  USPS has been an independent agency since July 1971, and critics say privatizing the USPS could open it up to political influence. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=16.06s)]
*  The legal ramifications of putting the Postal Service under the Commerce Department are unclear, but the USPS has been losing money for some time. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=25.38s)]
*  It lost nearly $10 billion in the most recent fiscal year. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=33.98s)]
*  The agency is currently in the middle of a 10-year overhaul led by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who announced this week he's stepping down. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=37.94s)]
*  Here's President Trump talking about the Postal Service's financial struggles. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  We want to have a Post Office that works well and doesn't lose massive amounts of money. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=50.02s)]
*  And we're thinking about doing that, and it'll be a form of a merger, but it'll remain the Postal Service, and I think it'll operate a lot better than it has been over the years. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=55.74s)]
*  It's been just a tremendous loser for this country, tremendous amounts of money are being lost. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=66.10000000000001s)]
*  As President Trump floats merging the Postal Service with the Commerce Department, a federal judge has cleared the way for the Trump administration to remove thousands of USAID workers off the job. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=72.62s)]
*  The judge ruled the labor unions have not shown its members will suffer irreparable harm. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=83.25999999999999s)]
*  While that is a win for the Trump administration, another federal judge is extending a block on Dozier's access to the Treasury Department's payment system. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  The judge says she's granting the request from 19 attorneys general because of possible disclosure of the state's bank records. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=97.06s)]
*  Still, she notes plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they are entitled to the broad and sweeping relief they seek. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=103.82000000000001s)]
*  That hasn't stopped New York State Attorney General Letitia James from celebrating. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=110.86s)]
*  She led the coalition of AGs in this lawsuit, and she says we just want a court order stopping Dozier and unauthorized, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=115.02000000000001s)]
*  unelected and unvetted individuals like Elon Musk from accessing people's private data and blocking federal funds. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=121.98s)]
*  We will keep fighting to protect all Americans from this administration's destruction. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=128.62s)]
*  Griff, Rachel and Kevin. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=132.98000000000002s)]
*  All right, Maddie. Thank you, Maddie. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=134.82s)]
*  So this is also interesting. First of all, the post office. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  This is exactly what a CEO does. He comes in, he sees what's not working. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=139.7s)]
*  If you if this was a private company and you were looking at how the post office was run, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=143.5s)]
*  you would get rid of that person and put in somebody else who can run it in a way that's more efficient and isn't losing money all the time. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHMZNJgwmYY&t=148.5s)]
