# Trump teases substantial cuts to China tariffs with trade deal
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0)
*  President Trump setting the stage for a trade deal with China as the administration says they could scale back on some of the new tariffs soon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=0.0s)]
*  Hurry mark Meredith is at the White House with details [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=8.44s)]
*  Mark have the have the conversations with China actually started because it sounds like things are in that way [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=12.52s)]
*  Steve Inslee Brian good morning friends [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=20.28s)]
*  Well, Steve the White House was asked yesterday whether or not the president's engaged in a one-on-one talk with President Xi of China and the White House [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=22.0s)]
*  Not willing to go on the record with that an indication that these conversations are still not happening at the most senior levels [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  Either way all three major US stock indexes are set to open sharply higher today given some of the news the president and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=33.88s)]
*  Treasury secretary made within the last 24 hours [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=40.08s)]
*  Suggesting that the trade war won't last forever as you all three know there's been a major sell-off on Wall Street [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=43.04s)]
*  ever since the trade war began [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=48.56s)]
*  We're doing fine with China. We're doing fine with every I think almost every country everybody wants to have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Involvement with the United States 145 percent is very high and it won't be that high [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=58.1s)]
*  We were talking about fentanyl where you know various [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=63.42s)]
*  Elements built it up to 145. No, it won't be anywhere near that high. It'll come down six essentially, but it won't be [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=67.34s)]
*  zero as [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=74.7s)]
*  Fox Business has learned Treasury Secretary Scott Besson also said something similar to investors this week that he expects a de-escalation with China [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=76.62s)]
*  In the near future two weeks ago the White House also pushed pause on imposing sweeping tariffs on almost every US trading partner [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=83.64s)]
*  It allowed this pause to allow negotiations to continue so far though [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=90.4s)]
*  No, new trade deals have been signed and the White House says stay tuned. I [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=94.12s)]
*  Spoke to our entire trade team this morning. There is a lot of progress being made [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=99.12s)]
*  We now have 18 proposals on paper that have been brought to the trade team again [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=102.98s)]
*  These are proposals on paper that countries have proposed to the Trump administration into our government [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  The other reason we're seeing so much green on Wall Street before the opening bell is the president made the strong suggestion again [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=114.88s)]
*  They has no plans to fire the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell just this week [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=120.94s)]
*  Trump suggested that Powell should have to leave his post as Federal Reserve Chairman [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=125.6s)]
*  His post isn't up until May of next year [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=129.68s)]
*  And so there was that suggestion that maybe Trump would try to push him out of the job [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=131.96s)]
*  But Trump said last night that he no longer feels that is the case [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=135.56s)]
*  But of course he wants to see interest rates brought down sooner rather than later later. Excuse me Steve Ainsley and Brian [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=139.46s)]
*  Yeah, the market seemed to like that. So then he sensed that there'll be [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=145.52s)]
*  Any progress made because Norway comes this week. Don't they want a trade deal, too? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=149.8s)]
*  Well, the White House has been very clear bright that they believe that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=154.64s)]
*  Everybody who's been on that hit list of the different tariffs will want to make a deal at some point [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=157.4s)]
*  The vice president India talking about trade as well and how to develop a further [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=161.8s)]
*  US-Indian relationship but in terms of actually getting these deals signed there's a question about timing because they have to be worked out [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=166.0s)]
*  It's not that it could just be, you know written on a napkin and go [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=172.1s)]
*  There's a lot of complicated language here [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=174.76s)]
*  The White House has said simply that their team is working on it [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=176.6s)]
*  But as lawmakers have been talking about they want to see progress quickly. All right. Thank you so much mark [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=179.52s)]
*  This is great news for China [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=184.32s)]
*  Scott Bessette was at a JP Morgan event in Washington DC talking to investors and he says he expects a de-escalation [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=185.56s)]
*  Of the trade war between the US and China [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=191.72s)]
*  He said no one thinks that the current status quo is sustainable because right now we have the hundred and twenty five percent [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=193.84s)]
*  reciprocal tariffs on imports from China in [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=199.92s)]
*  Addition to those twenty percent tariffs on Chinese goods to curb the flow of fentanyl into the United States [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=202.28s)]
*  So one of the things that the White House is asking from all the countries is [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=207.04s)]
*  Okay [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=211.92s)]
*  If you want to make a deal with us [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=212.44s)]
*  You got to make a deal with us that you're not going to deal with China [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=214.56s)]
*  And there are a number of countries that are pushing back on that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=218.28s)]
*  In fact, the EU has just come back and they said they will not decouple from China [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=221.44s)]
*  They said talks with the United States and relations with China are two distinct matters [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=226.52s)]
*  What the president is trying to do is he's trying to get so many people and countries around China to isolate China [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=232.08s)]
*  So that he's got better negotiation better leverage with China [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=239.08s)]
*  But right now we don't know how many countries are saying okay [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=242.8s)]
*  If I have to pick between one or the other I'll go with the United States [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  We don't know how many that's what China said on Monday [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=250.0s)]
*  They said we're going to threaten countries not to do deals with us and hasn't stopped you Japan hasn't stopped South Korea has not stopped [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=252.24s)]
*  India [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=259.92s)]
*  Obviously hasn't stopped India didn't stop Italy who feels though they could spearhead an EU deal [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=261.04s)]
*  I think it's really really encouraging to see things we get reconfigured [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=265.8s)]
*  But I also don't think we should show any weakness with China [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=269.52s)]
*  This is the moment we stared them down. We have lost a lot of market cap in doing this [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=273.12s)]
*  Let's make sure we get what we want in this restructuring and one of which they cannot steal intellectual property [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=278.52s)]
*  The other the other thing is they can't continue to hijack and screw up our patents [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  They steal our products they rename them and then they sell them back to us [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  Amazon two-thirds of all their products or or China, you know [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=293.76s)]
*  So now they're now standing up down there worried about their tech center where they suppress for so long now [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=297.12s)]
*  They're starting to prop up Alibaba [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=302.16s)]
*  They rehab Jack Ma. So now these now they're desperate to try to get their economy going [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBh_zgp-n0&t=304.20000000000005s)]
