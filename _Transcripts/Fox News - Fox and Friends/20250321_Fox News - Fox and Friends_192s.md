# Judge says Trump admin 'evaded' deadline in deportation flight battle
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA)
*  So we have team coverage this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=0.0s)]
*  Brooke Taylor is in Louisiana with the latest on the case [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=1.54s)]
*  involving Khalil. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=5.28s)]
*  But we begin with Alexandra Hoff live at the White House. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=6.16s)]
*  Good morning, Alex. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=9.06s)]
*  Well, good morning to you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=10.34s)]
*  So the DOJ did not respond to a series of five questions [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=11.6s)]
*  that a judge wanted answered yesterday [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=14.6s)]
*  about the deportation flights about alleged Trend Day Aragwa [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=16.78s)]
*  members. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=20.12s)]
*  The DOJ telling Fox that questioning [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  of sensitive national security information [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  is inappropriate judicial overreach. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=25.52s)]
*  So the Justice Department instead invoked the state's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=27.28s)]
*  Secrets Act. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=29.68s)]
*  Now, by 10 AM today, district court judge James Boasberg [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=30.48s)]
*  has ordered for a cabinet level administration official [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=33.88s)]
*  to explain why more information on those flights [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=36.68s)]
*  of alleged gang members cannot be revealed. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=39.16s)]
*  The judge fired back on that writing, quote, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=42.12s)]
*  the government again evaded its obligations. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  This is woefully insufficient. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=47.4s)]
*  And to begin, the government cannot [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=49.32s)]
*  proffer a regional ICE official to attest [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=51.22s)]
*  to a cabinet level discussions of the state's secrets [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=53.64s)]
*  privilege. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=56.4s)]
*  The White House sees all of this as an intentional [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=57.0s)]
*  slowing down of the president's agenda. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=59.5s)]
*  The president can't show up to Congress [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=62.34s)]
*  and introduce a bill or amend a piece of legislation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=64.02s)]
*  Congress can't show up in a courtroom and issue a ruling. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=67.22s)]
*  A district court judge cannot pretend [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=69.9s)]
*  he sits in the Oval Office. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=71.66s)]
*  No district court judge can assume [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=72.94s)]
*  the duties of the president of the United States. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=74.7s)]
*  And we are hoping the Supreme Court [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=77.62s)]
*  will provide that clarity. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  Well, the president called on Supreme Court Chief Justice [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=82.3s)]
*  Roberts last night writing if Justice Roberts and the United [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=84.62s)]
*  States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=87.72s)]
*  situation immediately, our country [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=90.64s)]
*  is in very serious trouble. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=92.8s)]
*  And this is a battle that is not new for President Trump. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  Looking back, he has had twice as many injunctions halt [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=97.08s)]
*  policies over his two terms than Presidents Bush, Obama, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=100.52s)]
*  and Biden combined here at a windy White House. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=103.96s)]
*  Just to summarize this case, because I [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=106.88s)]
*  think it's important to point out the core of this case [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=108.42s)]
*  that this hearing will be on today, the crux of it [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  is does the president have the authority [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  to deport individuals without due process [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=115.94s)]
*  if they are deemed terrorists? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=119.02s)]
*  Guys? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=120.62s)]
*  Alex, has the judge indicated that his main problem is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=121.46s)]
*  he didn't know who these people were on the flights? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=125.9s)]
*  Or is he just all caught up in whether the flights took off [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=128.54s)]
*  or whether they could have turned around? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=132.22s)]
*  Everything I'm reading is he just [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=133.94s)]
*  wants to rebuild what happened over the weekend. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=135.7s)]
*  Does he has he stated what his problem is with this situation? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=138.26s)]
*  Well, I think that's part of the State Secrets Act issue [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=143.94s)]
*  that he had, that there was this ICE official coming forward [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=146.22s)]
*  saying we're invoking this because of national security [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=149.06s)]
*  reasons. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=151.54s)]
*  He wants to hear from a cabinet level official really [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=152.18s)]
*  who these people are. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=155.22s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=156.18s)]
*  I think at the core, that is what the judge wants to hear, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=156.74s)]
*  wants to understand, to find out if these individuals would, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=159.84s)]
*  by law, be able to be sent out of this country [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=163.86s)]
*  or deemed terrorists. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=167.78s)]
*  But yeah, it's got caught up in a lot of this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=168.62s)]
*  Should the flights have been turned around, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=170.66s)]
*  why did they leave US airspace? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=172.5s)]
*  Thanks, Alex. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRxikROXJA&t=174.9s)]
