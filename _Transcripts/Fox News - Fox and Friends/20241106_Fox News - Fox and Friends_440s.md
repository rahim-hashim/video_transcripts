# Trump makes shocking gains in Fox News Voter Analysis
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4)
*  I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=0.0s)]
*  47th president and your 45th president. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=7.96s)]
*  This campaign has been so historic in so many ways. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=14.48s)]
*  This is a magnificent victory for the American people that will allow us to make America [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=18.32s)]
*  great again. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=25.72s)]
*  There you go. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=27.72s)]
*  Donald Trump is officially the president-elect and it's not even close. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=30.08s)]
*  It's the first time since Grover Cleveland and the second ever a president has won two [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=33.4s)]
*  non-consecutive terms, although others have tried. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=38.32s)]
*  The history books will look back at this as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=41.84s)]
*  political comeback of all time. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=46.56s)]
*  I think, just remember how things have happened in the last four years. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=48.4s)]
*  Donald Trump has secured more than 270 electoral votes so far. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=52.44s)]
*  He flipped battlegrounds including Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin red and defending [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=55.8s)]
*  North Carolina. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=60.36s)]
*  A couple still have not been declared. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=61.36s)]
*  I can't believe I'm saying this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=63.68s)]
*  As president-elect Trump prepares for a return to the White House, he would do some with [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=65.36s)]
*  a Republican majority in the Senate for the first time in four years after flipping an [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=70.6s)]
*  Ohio seat red. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  We have team coverage this morning. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=78.64s)]
*  We have Todd and Carly. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=80.4s)]
*  They're having breakfast with friends. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=81.4s)]
*  Carly is in Happy Place, North Carolina. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=84.68s)]
*  Maggie Valley. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=87.28s)]
*  Maggie Valley. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=88.28s)]
*  Why does it say Happy Place? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=89.28s)]
*  It says Happy Valley. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=90.28s)]
*  Happy Valley is Pennsylvania. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=91.28s)]
*  It's Maggie Valley, North Carolina, close to Asheville. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=92.28s)]
*  And Todd is talking to the diners in Tyrone, Pennsylvania. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=93.28s)]
*  Bill Mollugin is joining us from Palm Beach, Florida with Trump's plans for today. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=99.84s)]
*  But first, let's go out to Kevin Cork with a breakdown of Trump's path to 270. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=104.48s)]
*  Good, we're running out of music. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  Now, if you predicted a clean sweep of the battleground states by now president-elect [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=113.48s)]
*  Trump, and that, of course, didn't work for the campaign, I would tell you get out there [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=119.0s)]
*  and buy yourself a lotto ticket right now because Lady Luck is clearly on your side. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=123.48s)]
*  Either that or a historic campaign. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=128.16s)]
*  Maybe both. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=130.2s)]
*  I mean, take a look at the battleground states. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=131.2s)]
*  North Carolina, Trump wins. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=133.52s)]
*  Georgia, Trump wins. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=135.12s)]
*  Pennsylvania, Trump wins. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=136.64s)]
*  Wisconsin, same story. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=138.2s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, he's leading in Arizona and in Michigan and in Nevada and in Alaska. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=140.04s)]
*  I didn't even mention that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=145.36s)]
*  Of course, it's not a battleground state, but you get the picture. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=146.36s)]
*  And while the former president, now president-elect, is leading in all those states up for grabs, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=149.44s)]
*  yeah, we'll likely have results from each and every one of them at some point today. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=154.84s)]
*  And that is very good news for everybody. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=159.24s)]
*  Meantime, here's a bit of voter analysis for you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=161.88s)]
*  In case you're wondering about the Hispanic vote, yeah, of course, the Democrats do very [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=164.16s)]
*  well. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  You know what Joe Biden did in 2020? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=169.48s)]
*  63%. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=171.76s)]
*  Harris, off by 7. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=172.76s)]
*  Trump up by 6. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  That's huge. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  How about among voters under 30? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  Again, back in 2020, Biden 61. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  Harris off by 9. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  Trump up by 8. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=186.2s)]
*  That is impressive indeed. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=187.88s)]
*  How about those falling behind financially? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=189.44s)]
*  No doubt about this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  You figure they might trend for Mr. Trump, and indeed they did. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=192.83999999999997s)]
*  63 to 34. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=197.4s)]
*  We have yet to get a concession speech or a phone call or anything else from the Harris [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  campaign, though we do expect to hear from the Veep later today, at which point President-elect [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=204.4s)]
*  Trump can start officially getting ready for the inauguration and his second term. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=209.96s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=214.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=216.12s)]
*  Thanks so much, Kevin. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=217.12s)]
*  I hope we hear something today. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=218.12s)]
*  She just left her people standing out there yesterday. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=219.12s)]
*  She sent out a aid to greet them. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=221.8s)]
*  I think that was pretty disgraceful. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=224.2s)]
*  She never went out. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=225.2s)]
*  Never just to say, hey, she didn't even have to say, concede. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  Maybe she wanted to wait. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=229.64s)]
*  But at least go greet the people. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  They're out there in D.C. waiting for you at your alma mater. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=232.04s)]
*  You just left them there. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=235.11999999999998s)]
*  I want to hear from Joe Biden. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=236.28s)]
*  I want to know, I want to see Joe Biden pick up the phone and say congratulations to Donald [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=237.92s)]
*  Trump because you're the next guy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=241.64s)]
*  And start the transition. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=242.64s)]
*  So, y'all, look at the voter analysis. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=243.64s)]
*  We talked to 110,000 people to find out why they thought Trump won. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=247.62s)]
*  And they're saying voters across the country wanted change. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=253.7s)]
*  He is seen as a stronger leader than Harris in the same in a time of turmoil. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=256.28s)]
*  Here he is with Hispanics. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=260.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=262.14s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=263.14s)]
*  Hispanic. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=264.14s)]
*  So Harris got 56 percent, but he got 41 percent. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=265.14s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=267.58s)]
*  When we were growing up, they were Hispanics were normally Democrats. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=268.58s)]
*  Well, look at that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=271.5s)]
*  He had gone up six points in four years, was at 35. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=272.5s)]
*  And then when you look at black voters in 2020, he had 8 percent. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=275.7s)]
*  And this time he doubled. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=280.52s)]
*  And of course, a lot of it has to do with the economy. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=282.06s)]
*  And black men, he got one fourth, almost one fourth, 24 percent of black men. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=284.26s)]
*  The younger generation is 52, 46. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=288.58s)]
*  But look at how small the gap is. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=291.7s)]
*  So he had his areas he maxed out on. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=293.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=295.62s)]
*  So look how small the gap is on these three areas. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=296.62s)]
*  So that's why I think this is an American victory. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=298.8s)]
*  It's not a Republican victory. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=300.9s)]
*  America says I'm done with the woke stuff. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=303.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm done with letting crime run wild. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=305.06s)]
*  I'm done with the economy where you spend like crazy and jam green new deals down on [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=307.06s)]
*  throats and tell me I got to drive an electric car and give you and destroy the combustible [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=311.82s)]
*  engine business and tell me to go to China to buy my batteries. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=316.7s)]
*  People are done with it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=321.74s)]
*  And then you look at where you have somebody who's running for office who would not tell [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=322.74s)]
*  you what she did and what she stands for. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=327.6s)]
*  And then went in trouble, called every celebrity in the world. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=330.32s)]
*  And would this have been different if Cardi B could work the teleprompter? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=334.14s)]
*  Well, then been able to read her speech. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=337.46s)]
*  Well, Brian, it's also enhanced the celebrities as well. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=338.86s)]
*  You don't get to tell us what to do. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=341.5s)]
*  You don't get to lecture different minority groups and tell them and shame them for picking [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=343.1s)]
*  their personal circumstance over the joy, which is apparently disappeared now. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=350.1s)]
*  There's no more joy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=355.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=356.62s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson just sent me a stat in four years ago, Biden Harris got 81 million votes, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=357.62s)]
*  right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=365.14s)]
*  81 million. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=366.14s)]
*  So far, 66 million. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=367.14s)]
*  That's quite a fall off. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=370.65999999999997s)]
*  Of course, not all the votes are in. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  You for her. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  Still for her. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=373.65999999999997s)]
*  Trump at right now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=374.65999999999997s)]
*  More. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=375.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  But by about five to six million when we started, it's going to be interesting because Joe Biden [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=377.65999999999997s)]
*  took great pride in saying, you're a loser. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=382.38s)]
*  You're a loser. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=385.62s)]
*  I beat you by a lot. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=386.62s)]
*  OK, well, this is a million was. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=387.62s)]
*  Yeah, I want to hear that phone call between the two of them. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=390.62s)]
*  People are tired of legacy media telling us how to vote. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=393.62s)]
*  We saw right through that and we're tired of being called un-American and trash just [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=396.74s)]
*  because of the one one person that many people like to vote for. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=400.90000000000003s)]
*  And also, I think we should start with the illusion that Shapiro would have delivered [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=404.26s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=407.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=408.1s)]
*  He wouldn't have because if you look at Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, where it's heading, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=409.1s)]
*  Nevada where it's staying, the whole blue wall. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=413.46000000000004s)]
*  Why would we think that a so-called moderate governor, although Pennsylvanians don't think [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=416.1s)]
*  he's moderate, even though he's better on his feet than Tim Walz with a better resume, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=419.66s)]
*  I don't think he would have flipped Pennsylvania. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=424.98s)]
*  I think there's a different message. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=426.7s)]
*  They definitely would have gotten more votes. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87R6cDdlXV4&t=427.7s)]
