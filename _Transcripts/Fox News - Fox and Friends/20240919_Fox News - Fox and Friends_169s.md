# Blue state rallygoers hopeful Trump can flip state red: 'Anything is possible'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q)
*  Right, so I had a chance to talk to the rallygoers because I was stunned at the debate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  I found out that so many people get bored and leave early and leave. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=3.68s)]
*  So I wanted to find out the real story. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=7.12s)]
*  So I went into the stands before he came up and I wanted to find out how people felt about being there and were they bored. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=9.28s)]
*  Why was it important for you to be here tonight? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=18.6s)]
*  Just got to support our country. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=20.88s)]
*  We got to change things. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=22.12s)]
*  We got to make it great again. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=23.2s)]
*  It's important to support the county. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  It's going to see our values. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=25.92s)]
*  This is going to respect Americans, listen to Americans and want to keep us safe. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=27.8s)]
*  It's important for us as citizens to go out there and vote. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=32.28s)]
*  We keep hearing about his rallies. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=35.2s)]
*  We heard at the debate that people get bored and leave early. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=36.64s)]
*  Are you going to get bored and leave early? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=40.6s)]
*  No, I'm not leaving early, no. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=42.08s)]
*  What is going to describe the atmosphere? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=43.8s)]
*  Oh, it's electric. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=46.32s)]
*  What's different in the last three years? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Well, mayonnaise used to cost me $2.99 a jar. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  Now it's $7.49. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=52.88s)]
*  Can he win New York? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=54.32s)]
*  Anything's possible. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=56.36s)]
*  Okay, thank you so much. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=57.92s)]
*  Now, obviously, great sound bites, but Brian, you didn't leave early, did you? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=60.0s)]
*  I did. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=65.44s)]
*  Okay! [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=66.08s)]
*  Wow, you had a good reason. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=66.8s)]
*  You had to get up at 2 o'clock. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=68.92s)]
*  I stayed 40 minutes in, he was rolling, but when he walked out, when he stepped out there, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=71.24s)]
*  he had that runway, it was like the beginning of a WWE fight or when Tyson walked out, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=75.32s)]
*  like the minute he stepped out, I didn't see him, but someone saw him and the place starts [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  erupting. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=85.96s)]
*  I'd be shocked if he didn't say that this was one of the best appearances he had. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=86.96s)]
*  His speech was crisp, he was right to the point, he was on message, he was appealing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=91.55999999999999s)]
*  right to the New York issues as well as the national issues and responding to the news, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=94.96s)]
*  the assassination, so he was, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, no protective glass, just [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=98.88s)]
*  two teleprompters which were advisors, not verbatims, but this place was mobbed and I [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=104.24s)]
*  just think that the cops did an incredible job. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=111.08s)]
*  Commissioner Ryder, Bruce Blakeman, they probably could have used more magnetometers, but people [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=114.0s)]
*  were so patient to get in. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=120.28s)]
*  When I saw, I go, there's no way there's people getting in and just for proof, some of that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  footage, I don't know, I should have sent in earlier, I just taped all these people [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  on the outside. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=130.52s)]
*  I mean, you know how he says, look at the crowds on the outside, I never see the crowds, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=131.52s)]
*  I want everyone to see, huge crowds. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=135.48s)]
*  Look at that, that's Brian's video. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=137.04s)]
*  So the only two people that left early, Brian Kilmeade, who had to get up early, and the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  topless woman, she flashed the entire crowd for 20 seconds. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  Oh, I didn't see that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and she was jumping up and down, she lifted up for sure. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  There were two of them, according to the New York Post. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=149.72s)]
*  There were two, three people left early and then they escorted her out. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=150.72s)]
*  You mean two of what? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  Two flashers? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  Two people. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  Two ladies. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  Who did just that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUH7PSyp_2Q&t=157.51999999999998s)]
