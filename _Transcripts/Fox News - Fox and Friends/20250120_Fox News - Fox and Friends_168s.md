# BREAKING: Biden pardons Dr. Fauci, Mark Milley, Jan. 6 committee members
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM)
*  It's a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=0.0s)]
*  President Biden has just came across, just issues new pardons for Dr. Anthony Fauci. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=1.36s)]
*  You could call these preemptive pardons. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=7.28s)]
*  Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired four-star general Mark Milley. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=8.76s)]
*  This just happened moments ago. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=13.76s)]
*  It also includes the members of Congress and staff who served on the select committee and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=15.0s)]
*  the U.S. Capitol and D.C. metropolitan police officers who testified before the select committee. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=21.16s)]
*  This is Trump prepares to take the oath of office in just a few hours. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=29.68s)]
*  Would that include Liz Peabody? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=33.4s)]
*  What a mess. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=34.4s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=35.4s)]
*  Select committee? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=36.4s)]
*  Yes, select committee. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=37.4s)]
*  The whole select. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=38.4s)]
*  What does this say? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=39.4s)]
*  Mark Milley, who is chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under both Biden and Trump, you [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=40.4s)]
*  know that what he's done in the past, you know that he was calling China, trying to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=45.72s)]
*  putting down President Trump. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=51.44s)]
*  I mean, what are they afraid that Pete Hecsek is going to see when he goes to the Defense [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=53.36s)]
*  Department and look at the files and data? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=59.08s)]
*  There's been no talk of going after Anthony Fauci. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=62.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, Rambo is. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=65.56s)]
*  There may have been some senators, but the president himself has not said he wants to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=67.48s)]
*  prosecute Anthony Fauci. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=72.58s)]
*  Absolutely right. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=75.12s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=76.26s)]
*  You pardon somebody who's been convicted. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=77.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=79.56s)]
*  They haven't been convicted. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=80.56s)]
*  There's a confession. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=81.56s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=82.76s)]
*  It will be interesting to read the exact language and because it just broke, we haven't seen [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=83.84s)]
*  it yet. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=87.36s)]
*  But remember when Hunter Biden was pardoned by his father, the language was extraordinary [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=88.36s)]
*  because it essentially we know some things happen during certain time periods, but this [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  was a 10 year window. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=99.0s)]
*  Anything he did during those 10 years was essentially it was get out of jail card, get [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  out of jail free card. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=107.12s)]
*  So it'll be interesting to see the language, you know, the parameters of what time we're [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=108.38s)]
*  talking about and what he talks about, what he has pardoned them from. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  His brother wasn't on that list. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=119.42s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=120.82s)]
*  He has four and a half hours to pardon his brother. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=121.82s)]
*  I know that's going to get done. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=125.34s)]
*  By the way, the 51 Intel agents who said that laptop was fake, I believe one of the executive [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=126.34s)]
*  orders is going to rescind their security clearance. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=131.04s)]
*  Security clearance away. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=134.46s)]
*  But it's just so interesting to me that this is occurring right now. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=135.58s)]
*  I mean, what has that happened? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=140.9s)]
*  Four hours away from the president. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=142.5s)]
*  But how is it, full orange, has it ever happened? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  You see Maria Landon right behind this. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=145.54000000000002s)]
*  Has it ever happened before that a preemptive pardon was pushed? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=148.54000000000002s)]
*  A preemptive pardon. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=152.62s)]
*  Just in case I do something or you find something, you can't do that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=154.0s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=157.70000000000002s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfvsQr-iFSM&t=159.70000000000002s)]
