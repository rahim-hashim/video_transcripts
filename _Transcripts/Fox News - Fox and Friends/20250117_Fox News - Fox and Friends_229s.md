# Garbage truck driven by Trump heads to inaugural parade
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q)
*  Well, we all remember this viral moment of President-elect Donald Trump on the campaign trail taking questions from a garbage truck [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=0.0s)]
*  The day after President Biden referred to Trump supporters as garbage [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=7.92s)]
*  Well behind the wheel was Andrew Bryson and now he'll be driving that exact truck once again at Trump's inaugural parade [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=19.92s)]
*  Andrew joins us live right now Andrew [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=27.76s)]
*  I mean, how did you convince Secret Service and the president to allow you to drive the truck in the parade? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  Uh, I guess I I didn't really have to convince them the inaugural team actually reached out to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=39.6s)]
*  me asking if we'd be able to provide a truck for the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Parade and after making a few phone calls was actually able to get the truck that we had at the rally out there for them [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=49.28s)]
*  Andrew it's amazing. How cool is this because he's always for you know, the blue collar worker and it's great [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=57.28s)]
*  I know your vice president of the company loadmaster [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=62.72s)]
*  It's so cool that you were sitting there driving the future president of the united states and you're going to be there at inauguration day [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=65.28s)]
*  How are you feeling about all this and what was it like to be in the front seat with donald trump? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=70.8s)]
*  Pretty excited to be there. It's uh, kind of getting ready to fly out this morning [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  Going to spend the weekend out at dc getting things ready for the parade [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=82.88s)]
*  We're also going to have several other trucks out there for the liberty ball [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=86.8s)]
*  a very cool experience being [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=90.88s)]
*  Part of the green bay rally and driving donald trump in the truck and being able to meet him [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=93.52s)]
*  Yeah, so andrew tell us about when you got the opportunity [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  Uh to be with the president. What was he like? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=103.12s)]
*  Uh, of course this was before the election now. He's won. He's going to be the he's the president elect right now [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=105.44s)]
*  But what was the man trump like? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  I didn't get too much of an opportunity to talk to him a little bit of conversation. He just [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=115.44s)]
*  He seemed like someone they could sit down with and have a conversation with [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  He I just for lack of a better term. It's kind of seemed like a normal person [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=125.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, andrew. How did you outfit the truck to make it look like that? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  Uh, actually the campaign team had someone down in the green bay area put together the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=135.6s)]
*  Magnets that we put on the side of the truck. They picked up some flags down there [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=141.76000000000002s)]
*  And we once I got down to green bay put uh, put everything together [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=146.0s)]
*  Yeah, andrew why did you decide to support donald trump? What was the issue that attracted you to this campaign? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=149.84s)]
*  I just the biggest thing like a lot of people and just a lot of conversation about just the the state of the economy and the inflation and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  Uh, just the cost of everything I guess probably the biggest factor [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=166.96s)]
*  Obviously, there's a number of other issues as well, too [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=171.52s)]
*  But like the economy is the biggest issue in my mind [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, are you excited about being with him? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  Again, yeah, very excited. I don't know if i'll get the opportunity to see him again [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=180.56s)]
*  But just to be a part of the event and the parade is very exciting [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=184.56s)]
*  I don't know if you have family, but do you plan on bringing them with you? Are you going alone with the truck? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=188.96s)]
*  I'll be in the truck [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=195.36s)]
*  All right. Well andrew we wish you all the best do you have warm gear? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=198.08s)]
*  You need a good coat some gloves. I guess you're used to that though, right? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=202.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think next week it's supposed to be even colder up here than it is in dc. So it's pretty well prepared for it [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlxB_Dd3T-Q&t=207.20000000000002s)]
