# This is the most ‘dangerous’ anti-free speech period in history, attorney says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE)
*  After the left has spent years attacking Trump as a threat to democracy, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=0.0s)]
*  JD Vance laid out the real risk to your essential freedoms. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=4.26s)]
*  I believe that we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=8.5s)]
*  but unfortunately it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=13.0s)]
*  Waltz want to talk about. It is the threat of censorship and it's Kamala [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=17.12s)]
*  Harris saying that rather than debate and persuade her fellow Americans, she'd [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=20.76s)]
*  like to censor people who engage in misinformation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=24.96s)]
*  In a new op ed, Jonathan Turley lays out the facts, saying the Biden Harris [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  administration has been the most anti free speech White House in two [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=32.28s)]
*  centuries, and it could only worsen if she wins in November. He joins us now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=35.88s)]
*  Professor, thanks for being with us. That's quite a statement. The worst in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=40.6s)]
*  two centuries. There are some periods of serious censorship in American history. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=44.0s)]
*  Tell me why you fear this is the worst. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=48.08s)]
*  Well, I discuss this in my book, The Indispensable Right that this is perhaps [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=52.2s)]
*  the most dangerous anti free speech period in our history, because we've [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=56.0s)]
*  never seen an alliance like this of the government, corporations, the media, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=59.76s)]
*  academia, all aligned in favor of censorship and blacklisting. The Biden [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=64.28s)]
*  Harris administration has been really profoundly committed to that task, and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=70.84s)]
*  Harris particularly has supported censorship for disinformation. Governor [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=77.16s)]
*  Waltz has been out there saying that misinformation and hate speech are not [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=81.4s)]
*  protected under the Constitution. And there's a crushing irony there. I mean, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=86.72s)]
*  in calling for the censorship of other citizens accused of disinformation, the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=91.36000000000001s)]
*  governor is spreading disinformation. He's been told repeatedly by many of us [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=97.72s)]
*  that he's wrong, that that's just completely and demonstrably wrong. The [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=102.28s)]
*  Constitution does protect those forms of speech. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=106.72s)]
*  That's absolutely true. Let's just illustrate what you're talking about. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  Harris and Waltz pushing for censorship. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  There has to be a responsibility that is placed on these social media sites to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  understand their power. They are directly speaking to millions and millions of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=123.8s)]
*  people without any level of oversight or regulation, and that has to stop. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=129.0s)]
*  It's undermining the idea that mail-in ballots aren't legal. I think we need to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=135.76s)]
*  push back on this. There's no guarantee to free speech on misinformation or hate [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=140.52s)]
*  speech, and especially around our democracy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=145.28s)]
*  Professor, let's address those individual actually. When it comes to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=147.96s)]
*  Waltz, I've been a little bit confused whether or not he's just plain ignorant [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=151.44s)]
*  or he is pushing for censorship. As you point out, that's misinformation. He's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=155.04s)]
*  also said the fire in a crowded theater line, that's misinformation. That's not [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=158.96s)]
*  the limitation of free speech in America. Hasn't been since 1969. However, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=162.76s)]
*  Harris is saying there she's openly calling for censorship. She is embracing [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=168.44s)]
*  it in a way that is brazen. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=174.0s)]
*  Yeah, and she's not alone. You have two former Democratic presidential nominees [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=178.72s)]
*  who have been going to the sort of global elite, asking for Europe and others [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=183.76s)]
*  to censor fellow Americans. Hillary Clinton did that after Musk took over [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  Twitter, went to Europe and said, please use the Digital Services Act, this [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=192.0s)]
*  really horrific new law, to censor fellow Americans because Musk isn't going to do [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=196.6s)]
*  it, force him to do it. Then you had John Kerry recently going to one of these [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=202.76s)]
*  international groups and saying that the First Amendment's blocking us and these [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=206.68s)]
*  poor governments can't really censor as much as they would want. And that line [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=211.04s)]
*  about the crowded theater, I address in my book, and it's come up in testimony [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=216.23999999999998s)]
*  where Democratic members have recited that line to me. And I told Representative [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=222.67999999999998s)]
*  Goldman from New York, I said, do you realize that you're citing a line from a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  case that sent a socialist to jail for opposing a draft by passing out a flyer [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=231.44s)]
*  quoting the U.S. Constitution? Is that the standard you want? And he said, we [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=236.2s)]
*  don't need a legal lecture, but I think they do. These are the same voices saying [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  the same things since the beginning of our republic, that they have a reason to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=248.04s)]
*  silence others. It is pure misinformation. It's not the standard. Brandenburg versus [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  the United States replaced that old standard, and they do need a legal lecture. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=256.92s)]
*  They need some understanding of the United States Constitution. Perhaps from [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=261.4s)]
*  you, Professor Turley. Thank you so much for being with us this morning. Thank you, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=265.44s)]
*  Will. All right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyivfSYrFE&t=269.0s)]
