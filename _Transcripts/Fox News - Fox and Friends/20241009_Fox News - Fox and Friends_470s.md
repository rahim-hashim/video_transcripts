# 'INSANE': Kamala Harris flubs key question TWICE
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg)
*  So the former, the current president decided to delay his international travel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=0.0s)]
*  There was some talk, maybe Kamala Harris should not be going on the late nights, doing these [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=5.44s)]
*  podcasts in the middle of the storm. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=10.4s)]
*  But this is what she was doing last night with Stephen Colbert. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=12.36s)]
*  So would you like to have a beer with me so I can tell people what that's like? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=16.96s)]
*  Okay, this was, now we asked ahead of time because I can't just be giving a drink to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=20.64s)]
*  the vice president of the United States, but I'd ask you, you asked for Miller Highlight. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=26.68s)]
*  You asked for Miller Highlight. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=29.72s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=30.72s)]
*  Okay, the last time I had beer was at a baseball game with Doug. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=33.72s)]
*  Okay, so cheers. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=39.72s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=40.72s)]
*  There you go. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=41.72s)]
*  You know, the optics of that, of course if your name is Colbert, maybe you're going to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=42.72s)]
*  have a cold beer with the vice president. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=52.72s)]
*  But nonetheless, people are looking in going, really? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=54.64s)]
*  This was all part of her charm offensive yesterday where she was on a bunch of different shows. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=58.88s)]
*  There were no challenging questions. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=63.540000000000006s)]
*  And obviously, the hosts were doing their best to try to make her seem as presidential [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=65.84s)]
*  as possible. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=72.04s)]
*  She said the last time I had a beer was at a ball game. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=73.04s)]
*  Didn't say exactly when. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=75.36s)]
*  So right now, if you look at Joe Biden's record, you look at the disaster in Afghanistan, his [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=76.68s)]
*  numbers never recovered. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  Inflation at 9% after doing the rescue plan, inflation reduction act, the infrastructure [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=83.36s)]
*  deal. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=87.12s)]
*  The spending led to the problem we're seeing now when it comes to prices on everything [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=88.36s)]
*  and inflation, which has gone down. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=92.64s)]
*  The rate is increasing, but it's not really gone down from where it was four years ago. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=94.72s)]
*  So you would think the vice president, who still hasn't fully explained why the president's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  not running, he didn't come out and say, I'm too old and I'm losing my mind. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  We just thought that and we conclude that she said he was 100%. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  So when it comes to policy changes, what would she say is going to be the difference [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=115.64s)]
*  if she gets the job? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=119.44s)]
*  And what would she have done different if she had the job? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=121.04s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=124.08s)]
*  Well, if anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=125.08s)]
*  past four years? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=132.68s)]
*  There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of, and I've been a part of most of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=135.36s)]
*  the decisions that have had impact. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=140.84s)]
*  You are a member of the president administration. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=143.02s)]
*  Under a Harris administration, what would the major changes be and what would stay the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=145.62s)]
*  same? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=151.58s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=152.58s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm obviously not Joe Biden. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=153.58s)]
*  And so that would be one change. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  But also, I think it's important to say with 28 days to go, I'm not Donald Trump. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=160.34s)]
*  You know, there are 27 days to go. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=165.58s)]
*  That's the bet you got? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=168.3s)]
*  Nothing comes to mind. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=169.3s)]
*  I would have changed the botched Afghanistan withdrawal when 13 U.S. service members died. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=170.89999999999998s)]
*  But she was the last one in the room. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=174.57999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  She supported it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=177.01999999999998s)]
*  What about the border crisis when 1.8 million plus known gotaways, not to mention those on [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  the terror watch list, the hundreds on the terror watch list, the quadruple numbers over [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=182.42s)]
*  Donald Trump's when they were in office under Biden and Harris, inflation, 19.7% increase [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=187.38s)]
*  overall prices. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=193.89999999999998s)]
*  That's why when you look at her drinking a beer with Stephen Colbert and you see all [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=195.01999999999998s)]
*  of the destruction in North Carolina, destruction in Florida, another hurricane about to hit [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=199.5s)]
*  and blast out all these people's lives and houses and pictures and belongings. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=204.9s)]
*  And you see her drinking a beer and you know inflation's up and we can't afford groceries [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=211.02s)]
*  and you can't afford college. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=214.66s)]
*  But we're paying for college for everyone else who took a loan out. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  We're paying for illegal immigrants to have free health care and food and go to go to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=219.58s)]
*  school in our country. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=223.62s)]
*  And then she drinks a beer and says she wouldn't have changed anything over the last four years. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=224.66s)]
*  She was a twofer, Ainsley, because not only did she say she wouldn't have changed anything, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=228.82s)]
*  she followed it up by saying she's been a part of every major decision. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  And so if you're comfortable with the last four years, three and a half years of this [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=239.94s)]
*  presidency in this administration, the Kamala Harris is your person. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=244.98s)]
*  If you're upset with what's going on and you don't like the direction of the country, there's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=249.18s)]
*  another option for you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=253.78s)]
*  And that's why it seems like it is a tone deaf or bad answer. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=255.26s)]
*  Like I've hitched my my wagon to Joe Biden and I'm going to be exactly like him. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=259.94s)]
*  I'm going to be Biden 2.0. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=264.7s)]
*  But when you because what what defies logic is just the fact that Americans are deeply [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=267.09999999999997s)]
*  unhappy with the current state of the economy that we yesterday quoted that New York Times [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=273.65999999999997s)]
*  brand new poll. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=278.98s)]
*  of you watching right now, Americans say the economy is either fair or poor. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=281.22s)]
*  That's a poor reflection on Joe Biden. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=285.90000000000003s)]
*  About three quarters say they have cut back on groceries because you can't afford it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=288.58000000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  If you're cutting back on groceries now, you want four more years, eight more years of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=294.58000000000004s)]
*  cutting back on groceries. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=298.94000000000005s)]
*  That's why it just seems like she should have had a different answer. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=300.42s)]
*  She did her best to try to spin it, you know, make it a little joke about, well, I'm not [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=303.76000000000005s)]
*  I'm not Donald Trump. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=308.62s)]
*  But when people think about it, it's like, is that what I really want? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=310.41999999999996s)]
*  Here's what Tim Murtagh said with the Trump campaign. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=314.82s)]
*  It says it's insane. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=316.82s)]
*  She wasn't ready to crush this question in the first place. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=317.82s)]
*  Weeks ago was supposed to be her central argument. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=320.3s)]
*  Turn the page, right? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=322.74s)]
*  She's different. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=323.74s)]
*  No leadership, new leadership. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=324.74s)]
*  And she didn't know the answer as to how or why she's different twice. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=326.21999999999997s)]
*  The other subplot is it looks like the Biden camp. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=330.86s)]
*  I heard about this about two weeks ago that the Biden camp is upset that when she's giving [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=333.78s)]
*  her speeches, she doesn't talk about all they accomplished. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  You know, everything I mentioned, the infrastructure deal and the Boston Act. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=340.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=343.3s)]
*  And he goes, why don't you? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=344.3s)]
*  Why didn't she mention? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=345.3s)]
*  So he's getting a little ticked off. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=346.3s)]
*  Then he's not asked to go out on the campaign trail. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=347.3s)]
*  It's getting a little ticked off. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=348.46000000000004s)]
*  Then calls a press conference while she's on the stone. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=349.90000000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=352.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=353.62s)]
*  And that's what time says there's no air between us and contradicts what she was saying about [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=354.62s)]
*  Ron DeSantis. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=358.1s)]
*  So she's in the moment of her interview, she's going after Ron DeSantis saying that, you [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=359.1s)]
*  know, he's being childish, selfish, and then Joe Biden is on record saying, oh, the relationship [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=364.98s)]
*  is fine. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=371.3s)]
*  I gave him my personal cell phone number. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=372.3s)]
*  He couldn't answer the question why he wasn't running on The View. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=373.3s)]
*  That's why when The View asked him, you know, he goes, well, it was time. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=375.42s)]
*  Because he doesn't know. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=379.82s)]
*  He's upset that he was pressured. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=380.82s)]
*  He still wants to run. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=382.5s)]
*  He got stabbed in the back by Nancy Pelosi. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=383.5s)]
*  But he has been sidelined. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=385.14000000000004s)]
*  And who's to the rescue? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=386.56s)]
*  Tomorrow, Barack Obama is going to be appearing in Pittsburgh on behalf of Kamala Harris. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=388.06s)]
*  Bob Woodward in his book says that Biden blames Obama for the collapse of Afghanistan, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=393.7s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=398.84s)]
*  He said that he underestimated Putin. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=400.26s)]
*  He told him different and he invaded, did nothing, invaded, did nothing. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=402.88s)]
*  And that's why he had the problem. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=406.28s)]
*  Good luck with that, guys. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=408.18s)]
*  Next time you have that reunion should be fun. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=409.18s)]
*  Well, remember when Obama would speak, we were like, wow, he is impressive. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=411.34s)]
*  He's a great orator. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=415.14s)]
*  He ended up, you know, like him or not, he was really good as a politician. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=417.3s)]
*  He's great. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=421.58s)]
*  Kamala, I watched all those interviews yesterday. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=422.58s)]
*  Well, that's the problem. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=424.53999999999996s)]
*  That's the problem, Ainsley. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=425.53999999999996s)]
*  The mentee, because Barack Obama, as Brian has noted correctly, is the mentor. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=426.53999999999996s)]
*  The gene wasn't passed on. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=431.5s)]
*  She's terrible at it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=433.41999999999996s)]
*  Even Michelle Obama knows how to get a crowd. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=434.58s)]
*  She's one of the most popular people in politics. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=436.7s)]
*  Kamala Harris just doesn't have that vibe. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=438.86s)]
*  Well, they're not the same kind of orator. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=441.06s)]
*  But the big question is whether or not the endorsement, putting, you know, the full weight [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=443.94s)]
*  of the Obamas behind her. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=449.29999999999995s)]
*  Is that going to drag her over the finish line? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=451.1s)]
*  They would like to say. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=453.38s)]
*  It dragged Joe Biden over the finish line. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=454.38s)]
*  He could barely talk, didn't even had a fist bump during the pandemic. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=456.14000000000004s)]
*  This is true. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILW8AnPaaLg&t=458.3s)]
