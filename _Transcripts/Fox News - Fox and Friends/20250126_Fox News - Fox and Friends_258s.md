# Could smart phone use cause hallucations?
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA)
*  A new Fox News poll shows roughly a third of Americans plan to change their drinking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=0.0s)]
*  habits after a surgeon general recommendation to put cancer warning labels on alcoholic [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=5.14s)]
*  beverages. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=10.32s)]
*  Alcohol is the third leading cause of preventable cancer in the U.S. and the CDC says there [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=11.82s)]
*  are nearly 200,000 alcohol-related deaths a year. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=16.92s)]
*  Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Sapphire joins us now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=20.96s)]
*  So really, do you really think there are going to be a bunch of people who quit drinking [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=25.44s)]
*  because of a surgeon general's warning on a beer can? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=30.8s)]
*  Well, good morning, Charlie. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=33.68s)]
*  No, I certainly don't think that the warning label on alcohol from the surgeon general [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=35.28s)]
*  recommendation is actually going to thwart people from drinking alcohol. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  I will say that Americans at this point, we are drinking too much and we saw a lot of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=43.24s)]
*  that throughout COVID. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=47.0s)]
*  But the reality is, Charlie, alcohol has been ingrained in our civilization for centuries [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=48.36s)]
*  upon centuries. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=52.56s)]
*  If you even look to the blue zones across the world where people live the longest and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=53.68s)]
*  the healthiest, it's not because they've cut out alcohol entirely from their diet. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=57.04s)]
*  In fact, alcohol is quite common in their diets. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=60.96s)]
*  But what we're seeing here, what's been going on here, is that people are drinking more. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=64.8s)]
*  They're drinking a lot more hard liquor. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  They're having a lot of those sugary additives. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  And all of that is leading to a rise in inflammation, metabolic disorders, and ultimately it is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=72.88s)]
*  resulting in some cancers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  So Charlie, do I think that we as individuals could probably all benefit from drinking a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=81.08s)]
*  little bit less? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=84.55999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=85.55999999999999s)]
*  Do I think that the surgeon general's warnings are really going to be what gets people to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=86.55999999999999s)]
*  stop? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=91.52s)]
*  I do not think so. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=92.52s)]
*  Well, I appreciate that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=93.52s)]
*  That makes me feel a whole lot better. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=95.24s)]
*  I was a little bit nervous about this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=97.0s)]
*  But far more concerning to me anyway is this new study showing that smartphone use leads [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=99.44s)]
*  to hallucinations, detachment from reality, and aggression in teens. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=106.36s)]
*  And what's so amazing to me about this, as young as 13 years old, where does the aggression [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=113.92s)]
*  come from? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=118.53999999999999s)]
*  Well, Charlie, so this is what you're referring to right now is a study of looking at over [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=119.88s)]
*  10,000 adolescents ages 13 to 17 in the United States and across India. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=124.36s)]
*  And what they have seen is that these kids are reporting hallucinations, specifically [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=129.0s)]
*  if they spend a lot of times on video games, social media. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=133.88s)]
*  Now, why is this happening? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=136.6s)]
*  This actually is not surprising. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=138.12s)]
*  Think about these games that they play. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=139.8s)]
*  They're high levels of violence. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=142.08s)]
*  They're all of a sudden having difficulty perceiving what is real, what is not. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=143.88s)]
*  We're seeing an uptick in violence in adolescents. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=147.36s)]
*  We see it in the schools, cyberbullying and others. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=149.56s)]
*  One of the other things that I found very concerning about this study, Charlie, is the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=153.0s)]
*  fact that about a third of the kids, females more than males, were reporting suicidal thoughts. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=156.24s)]
*  At this point, I think the evidence is overwhelming. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=162.72s)]
*  Our increased digital use, video games, it can all have detriments when it comes specifically [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=165.72s)]
*  to our children, adults too. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=171.0s)]
*  So me as a mom of three and a physician, I wholeheartedly tell people, try to keep your [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=172.84s)]
*  kids off these devices as much as possible. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=177.32s)]
*  My kids, they do not get their electronics during the week. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=180.28s)]
*  We try to go on any sort of vacation we go on. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=183.16s)]
*  We get rid of the electronics. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=185.36s)]
*  Make sure that your child is not addicted. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  These are heavily addicted. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=189.08s)]
*  We've seen with brain imaging, MRI, that it does alter their brain chemicals and the way [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=191.04s)]
*  that their brain is working. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=195.36s)]
*  So it is not surprising the mental health effects, but also it really is thwarting their [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=196.92s)]
*  socialization skills and just they're becoming adults. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=202.84s)]
*  It is altering their brain. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=207.28s)]
*  It really is amazing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=208.96s)]
*  It's kind of the world's largest human experiment in human history. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=209.96s)]
*  Now I was told by a little birdie that today is your birthday. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=215.96s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  It is my birthday. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  Yes it is. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  Well happy 30th birthday. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  We're so proud to know you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=225.84s)]
*  My son's turning 25 this year as well, but it's definitely my 30th. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=227.68s)]
*  Well you look like you're 30. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=232.84s)]
*  It's because of all the healthy eating and the moderate drinking and staying off your [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=234.2s)]
*  stupid cell phone. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=239.56s)]
*  Everything in moderation, Charlie. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=240.56s)]
*  Live your happiest and healthiest life. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  Dr. Safire, thank you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zZtKpKIUA&t=244.56s)]
