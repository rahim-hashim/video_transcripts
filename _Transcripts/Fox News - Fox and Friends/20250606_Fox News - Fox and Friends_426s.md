# Peter Doocy reveals what Trump plans to do with Tesla amid Musk feud
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ)
*  President Trump and Elon Musk at odds on a number of issues from the big, beautiful bill, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the subsidies for electric vehicles and their disagreements spilling over into the public. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  And possibly who runs NASA is a big deal too. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=12.68s)]
*  So could a big, beautiful truce be in the works or will that divide deep in? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Peter Ducey is live at the White House with the details. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Peter? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=23.44s)]
*  And we have so much more to report about this just since we talked in the last hour. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=24.44s)]
*  So when you walk to the broadcasting tents here on the north side, you see West Executive [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=28.66s)]
*  Drive. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=33.9s)]
*  That's the driveway between the White House and the old executive office building. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=34.9s)]
*  There is a Tesla there that President Trump bought during a Tesla demo on the South Lawn [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=39.06s)]
*  a few months ago to try to help Elon Musk's business while it was being vandalized. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=43.94s)]
*  We are told that that Tesla, still sitting there, the red Tesla with Florida tags, is [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  either going to be given away or sold off. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=52.62s)]
*  And we are told that it was about a month that Elon Musk was wearing thin on Trump. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=56.78s)]
*  So this was not a sudden exit and then blow up. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=62.3s)]
*  There was about a month that he was wearing thin, the president's word. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=65.97999999999999s)]
*  Something else, there was some reporting today about the possibility of a Trump and Elon [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=69.9s)]
*  Musk phone call to make nice. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=74.58s)]
*  Aides are telling me that is not something they are tracking. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=77.5s)]
*  It's possible that some staffers might try to talk to Musk, but no Trump and Musk call, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=79.94s)]
*  at least not that we know about. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=85.17999999999999s)]
*  We did hear from the president yesterday and he didn't sound mad, but he sounded disappointed. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=86.78s)]
*  Elon and I had a great relationship. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=94.5s)]
*  I don't know if we will anymore, but I'm very disappointed in Elon. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=97.97999999999999s)]
*  I've helped Elon a lot. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=101.58s)]
*  And I'll be honest, I think he misses the place. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=102.58s)]
*  I think he got out there and all of a sudden he wasn't in this beautiful oval office. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  The lowest blows yesterday came from Elon. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=109.7s)]
*  He said, without me, Trump would have lost the election. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=112.17999999999999s)]
*  Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  And then he wrote, time to drop the really big bomb. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=118.62s)]
*  Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=120.7s)]
*  That is the reason they have not been made public. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  Have a nice day, DJT. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=124.7s)]
*  The president, of course, said that Musk had been wearing thin and he was asked to leave. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=126.66s)]
*  And the president offered up the idea that the fastest way to save money would be to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=130.66s)]
*  cancel Musk's government contracts. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=134.1s)]
*  Musk then wrote, in light of the president's statement about cancellation of my government [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=136.66s)]
*  contracts, SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=141.22s)]
*  But he later said, OK, we won't decommission Dragon. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=147.14s)]
*  Trump rarely seems as close to aides as he did for a time to Elon Musk. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=151.1s)]
*  And we asked about that at the start of his term. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=155.46s)]
*  Elon Musk said today, I love Donald Trump as much as a straight man can love another man. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=157.66s)]
*  What is the first thing you think about that? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=166.66s)]
*  Oh, I think she'll be OK with it somehow. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=168.66s)]
*  So, this was a sensational back and forth on the platform Elon Musk owns yesterday. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=171.66s)]
*  But there were signs of strain for the last week or so in public. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=177.66s)]
*  Elon Musk blew up in the Oval Office during his sendoff when I tried to ask him about [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=182.22s)]
*  this big New York Times report that alleged he was blurring the lines between medical [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=186.1s)]
*  and recreational use of drugs. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=192.16s)]
*  And we still don't have any real clarity about that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=194.4s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=197.92s)]
*  Well, one thing is pretty clear, Peter. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=198.92s)]
*  Isn't he very, wasn't Elon Musk really tight with JD Vance? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=200.32s)]
*  Didn't they have a relationship prior because of their tech backgrounds? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=204.4s)]
*  And I'm wondering with him, he's also tight, Elon Musk is tight with Don Jr. too. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=208.28s)]
*  So I don't know, did he pre-think this? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=213.1s)]
*  Is he breaking up with everybody he knows there? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  It's unclear how much thought went into this ahead of time, but we are not hearing any [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=219.68s)]
*  Republicans come out to say we are with Elon Musk. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  Even the Republicans who were with him a couple days ago when he started saying we need the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=228.36s)]
*  big, beautiful bill to be smaller. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=233.6s)]
*  And if anything, some of the top folks around here that you talk to, it seems like this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=236.96s)]
*  actually helps the big, beautiful bill, because if lawmakers, elected Republicans have to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=240.88s)]
*  pick a side between Elon Musk, who wants the bill smaller and killed in its current form, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=247.16000000000003s)]
*  or Donald Trump, who wants it through, most of the people in elected Washington are going [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=253.08s)]
*  to go with Donald Trump. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=258.88s)]
*  Yeah, everybody not name Rand Paul and Tom Massey. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=260.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  Thanks so much, Peter. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Peter. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  Elon, this is what Caroline Levitt said. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  Elon can speak for his companies as a businessman, but President Trump has the responsibility [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=270.88s)]
*  to fight for our country. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=275.26s)]
*  He said Cruz was on last night. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=276.64s)]
*  He said it's unfortunate. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  They're both extraordinary men. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=279.12s)]
*  He said Elon's an incredible business leader and businessman, and Trump's phenomenal. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=280.32s)]
*  Works daily pulling this country back from the abyss. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=285.96s)]
*  He said they're both great leaders. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  When they were together, they were better for the country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=289.68s)]
*  And Elon was right. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  He said we need to make the bill better. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=292.91999999999996s)]
*  We need to make more cuts. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  And he said in the Senate, they will definitely be doing that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  They're still together. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=298.24s)]
*  This is just a fight. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=299.52s)]
*  Grown men fight. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  We don't get to see it publicly sometimes. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=302.32s)]
*  Yeah, they should have handled this behind closed doors, but there's just no alternative. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=304.52s)]
*  What is Elon going to do? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  Go become a Democrat? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  Going to start a third party? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=312.4s)]
*  He is our George Soros, and Donald Trump is the right Barack Obama. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  And the president has a role. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=319.0s)]
*  He has to get things passed. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=321.18s)]
*  He has to bring the coalition together. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=322.68s)]
*  He has to worry about the Senate as well as Congress, and has to keep the tent together, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=323.96s)]
*  whereas Elon can put pressure from his standpoint of saying, I want this in the bill, but he [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=329.12s)]
*  doesn't have the responsibility of making sure it gets passed. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=334.4s)]
*  He's used to having his company where he has the final say. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=338.04s)]
*  The government doesn't work that way. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=341.04s)]
*  He spent $288 million for Republican causes. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=342.24s)]
*  Tesla stock is down 14 percent. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=345.4s)]
*  And the problem he has is Elon Musk is brilliant, but he's not popular. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=347.48s)]
*  So every Democrat is against him now. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=352.0s)]
*  And now Republicans are asked to make a choice between the most popular Republican and Elon [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=355.0s)]
*  Musk. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=358.84s)]
*  He's not going to come out on top there. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=359.84s)]
*  All he has is money, and he is brilliant. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=361.52s)]
*  But Bill Ackman gave a lot of people hope when he put this out and he got a response. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=363.94s)]
*  He is a self-made billionaire and a friend of both men. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=369.28s)]
*  He said, I support Donald Trump and Elon Musk, and they should make peace for the benefit [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=373.0s)]
*  of the great country. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=377.35999999999996s)]
*  We are much stronger together than apart. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=378.35999999999996s)]
*  And then Musk came right back with this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  You're not wrong. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=384.08s)]
*  That beats you're on Epstein's list. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=385.52s)]
*  They'll definitely make peace. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=387.32s)]
*  Donald Trump has had feuds with a lot of other people, a lot of Republicans. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=388.64000000000004s)]
*  Mark Arubio, JD Vance, I mean, pretty much his whole cabinet. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  Ted Cruz, remember? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFElhBleKiQ&t=395.44s)]
