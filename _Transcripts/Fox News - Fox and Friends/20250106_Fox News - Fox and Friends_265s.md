**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ)
*  The NYPD arresting a man accused of at least two stabbings on the subway last week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Jamar Banks facing assault and weapons possession charges after he was accused of stabbing an [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=5.44s)]
*  MTA employee Thursday and another man on New Year's Day. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=10.32s)]
*  We're now learning the suspect has been arrested, drum roll please, 87 times. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=14.8s)]
*  Joining us now is the founder of the Guardian Angels, Curtis Leewith. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=21.48s)]
*  Curtis you've been in the subways you tell me since 1979. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=24.2s)]
*  Now you and your team are back there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=27.2s)]
*  What brought you back there? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=29.48s)]
*  Cases like that? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=30.92s)]
*  It's never been worse Brian. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=31.92s)]
*  And we have a combination where when you descend into the subway it's a combination of Dante's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=34.6s)]
*  Inferno, Clockwork Orange and Jack Nicholson in the Shining, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=40.44s)]
*  Nest. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=45.92s)]
*  This guy you're talking about, 87 priors, not hard to find. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=46.92s)]
*  Living in the subway. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=50.44s)]
*  He lives on two lines. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=51.44s)]
*  He only is a creature of habit, rides the two and the five train with a knife in his [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=52.84s)]
*  hand. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=58.36s)]
*  The cops lock him up, D.A. Bragg, you know his name, cuts him loose time and time again. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=59.36s)]
*  He's a threat to everybody in that subway system. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=64.8s)]
*  Then they put out an all points bulletin. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=67.84s)]
*  This man is extremely dangerous. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=69.6s)]
*  Well let me tell you something, everyone is in danger on the subway. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=71.84s)]
*  Look at that woman who was turned into a human torch. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=75.92s)]
*  From New Jersey. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=79.16s)]
*  Debrina Kawham, cheerleader, all American girl, the Jersey girl. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=80.16s)]
*  See when I'm dealing with the homeless and emotionally disturbed, which is what we guardian [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=85.24s)]
*  angels do because they're the forgotten people. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=88.92s)]
*  They're Americans. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=91.36s)]
*  Migrants they put up in hotels. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=92.36s)]
*  Americans they are allowed to sit in their squalor and ride round and round. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=94.84s)]
*  We don't help them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=100.36s)]
*  And when we talk to them we find out they're people just like you and me who just had a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=101.44s)]
*  hard time and now they're forced to live on the subway. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=106.08s)]
*  And our officials, our governor and our mayor do nothing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=109.12s)]
*  Not only that, they are bragging. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=111.92s)]
*  The governor has cut a video showing how great it is on the subway bragging that we have [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=114.28s)]
*  cameras in every subway. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=118.6s)]
*  Good. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=119.8s)]
*  Now we can video the assaults as they happen. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=120.8s)]
*  The attacks as they take place. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=123.52s)]
*  Right, and then do nothing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=125.6s)]
*  So the NYPD can't staff an academy like they used to. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=126.83999999999999s)]
*  So because we don't have enough cops on the subway, it's all related to the fact they're [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=130.64s)]
*  not backed up by the mayor and the governor because there's no qualified immunity. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=135.12s)]
*  You're going to get sued if you put your hands on anyone. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  There's cameras everywhere trying to get you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=143.64s)]
*  Brian, imagine you're a cop. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  Toughest job in America and New York City because you can't do anything and you find [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  out instead of putting a billion dollars back into your budget, which they took out when [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  de Blasio was the mayor and they were dancing the horror and the Tarantella, they gave five [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  billion dollars to illegal aliens. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=161.88s)]
*  Five billion dollars and they gave nothing to the cops. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=164.76s)]
*  So imagine you're a cop. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=168.04s)]
*  Do you want to stay in New York City? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=169.04s)]
*  You're being recruited from all over the country where they're offering you a much [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=170.84s)]
*  better pay scale. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=174.48s)]
*  They treat you better and they let you be a cop. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  We have flight, not just of people in New York City and New York State, but desperately [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=178.24s)]
*  needed cops. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=182.88s)]
*  Put the cops back in the subway. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=183.88s)]
*  You won't need guardian angels. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=186.2s)]
*  And stop fare evasion because if you just let people come and go into the subway, you're [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=188.32s)]
*  going to have more of these files. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=193.24s)]
*  Just let me just full circle. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=194.24s)]
*  Congestion pricing, first time in America. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  You get charged nine dollars, go back and forth. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=198.32s)]
*  That's that's a peg coming out of your pocket. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  They want to force people into the subways to get them off the streets. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=204.4s)]
*  And that's where the crime is happening, which they can't curtail. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=209.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=212.0s)]
*  Well, give everybody who goes into the subway a bulletproof vest and have them an individual [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=213.0s)]
*  police officer like Eric Adams, the mayor has 12 with him. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=218.22s)]
*  Armed cops like Kathy Hokel has 12 state superintendents. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=221.84s)]
*  These politicians are delusional. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=227.04s)]
*  They'll tell you, Brian, it's your perception of crime. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=228.88s)]
*  Perception. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=232.48s)]
*  What a boom slap in the face to everybody who's got to take that subway and pay their [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=233.48s)]
*  taxes. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=238.52s)]
*  So he's back in the subways. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=239.52s)]
*  He's been there on and off when needed since 1979. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=240.52s)]

*  That's a permissive DA backed up by George Soros, who was just given a Medal of Freedom [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=245.36s)]
*  Award over the weekend. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jh6PA24mnQ&t=249.48s)]
