# 'COMMON SENSE': Trump overwhelmingly turns the tide with young gen, survey shows
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28)
*  President-elect Trump taking a victory lap to celebrate his gains with young [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=0.0s)]
*  voters with support from 18 to 29 year olds going up 11% since 2020. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=5.24s)]
*  So we got the highest vote ever for a Republican candidate. We won by 36 points [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=12.52s)]
*  with young people. That never happens. And for all of us standing before you [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=19.76s)]
*  today I can proudly proclaim that the golden age of America is upon us. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=23.96s)]
*  So the question remains what's causing the shift? Independent Women's Features [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=30.04s)]
*  editor-in-chief Katie McKewe. I just call you KMW all the time anyway. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=35.44s)]
*  We work together a lot. I just want to ask you about why you think this is [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=40.6s)]
*  happening because I know we have talked especially going back to Election Day [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=44.64s)]
*  about this idea that young people are really fed up. They're feeling more [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=48.6s)]
*  anxious about where the direction of the country has been. I think that was behind [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=53.84s)]
*  a lot of this. What say you? And I think it surprised a lot of Democrats that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  young voters turned out for Trump in the numbers that they did. But as a Gen Z-er [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=61.96s)]
*  it actually didn't surprise me at all that Trump's support among young adults [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=66.12s)]
*  is surging. And it is surging. There was another poll this week that found that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=69.44s)]
*  as many as 59% of young adults between the ages of 18 through 29 approve [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=73.04s)]
*  of the Trump transition team and what he's trying to do. And I think what [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=78.48s)]
*  happened is that Democrats, they underestimated what Trump is calling his [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=82.16000000000001s)]
*  common-sense revolution. I think they assumed that because young adults my [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=86.64s)]
*  age have been so inundated with leftism that we would never question it. Well it [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=90.84s)]
*  turns out that young adults also enjoy a bit of common sense especially on [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  cultural issues. I think of one young voter who spoke to the New York Times [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=99.56s)]
*  after voting for Trump who said that she was particularly radicalized about the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=103.36s)]
*  issue of men playing in women's sports. This is actually a big problem for young [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=107.6s)]
*  women my age. And again they didn't think that we would ever question leftism but [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=111.72s)]
*  the fact is they started a culture war that now they can't finish. Let me ask [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=116.52s)]
*  you though about this idea of young people not just being frankly being [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=120.56s)]
*  tired of woke if I'm really blunt about it because this idea of men creating [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=125.24s)]
*  spaces in women's traditional spaces I think that bothers a lot of people too. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  But I also think there's an element of this. There is a traditional family [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=135.56s)]
*  growth in this country. There's a yearning if you will for faith and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=139.44s)]
*  frankly I think the economy is always going to be the number one driver. If you [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  have grown up in an era where your parents had a house and they were able [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=148.48s)]
*  to have careers and start families and now you're feeling like you don't get [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=151.68s)]
*  that I think that might have also turned the tide. And part of this is as you [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=155.44s)]
*  mentioned young adults are searching for meaning and fulfillment. Sure. And they're [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=159.24s)]
*  actually turning to things like religion and other traditional institutions [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=163.04s)]
*  that many thought that they had left behind. And that's very encouraging to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  see as a pastor's daughter and as someone whose faith is very important to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  her. And again I think what's happened is that young adults have not found in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=172.88s)]
*  leftism what they have now been able to find in religion. Because remember [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=177.2s)]
*  leftism is its own kind of religion. It requires total obedience to its beliefs. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=181.32s)]
*  Yeah. The problem is those beliefs just so happen to be at odds with human nature [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  and what most people need. And so when that happens its adherents are really [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=190.04s)]
*  left with one of two choices. They can either become even more radicalized [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=194.48s)]
*  because they assume that the problem is they're just not militant enough. I think [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  of the young adults who participated in the anti-Israel student encampments or [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  even the large number of young adults who shockingly support the murder of the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=206.0s)]
*  United Health Care CEO. Just insane. Yes or the other option is that they [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=210.12s)]
*  abandoned leftism altogether which is what we are starting to see and I hope [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=215.0s)]
*  this election's results give us a little bit of insight into which direction [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=218.76s)]
*  they ultimately choose. KMW, great to see you my friend. And the one PK I know [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=222.4s)]
*  that's actually a really good PK. Proud of you. Yes. Haley McGee, thank you for [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=226.24s)]
*  joining us. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWDqjx9N28&t=231.0s)]
