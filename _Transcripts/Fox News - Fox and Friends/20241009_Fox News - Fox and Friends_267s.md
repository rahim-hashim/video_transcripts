# Elon Musk: America's 'destiny' is on the line
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8)
*  So today, former president Donald Trump is back on the trail in battleground Pennsylvania, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=0.0s)]
*  fresh off his massive rally and butler with Elon Musk, who is reportedly planning more [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=4.4s)]
*  appearances with the campaign. Pittsburgh-based columnist and Washington Examiner, national [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=10.16s)]
*  political reporter Selena Zito spoke to Musk at the rally over the weekend about the stakes [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=15.84s)]
*  of this year's election. She joins us now with what she learned. Selena, you've been on top of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=21.68s)]
*  this. You predicted the Trump rise back in 2016. I know Elon is registering people to vote in PA. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=26.96s)]
*  What is the race looking like right now there? So the race has been tight, obviously, if you look [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=35.84s)]
*  at the polling. But I think I would still give the edge to president, former President Trump, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=44.32s)]
*  in that he is making appearances along with Ohio Senator J.D. Vance in the areas that are most [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=51.76s)]
*  important. A lot of people focus on Pittsburgh and Philly and Philly and Pittsburgh. But honestly, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=59.44s)]
*  the race is run in places like Cambria County and in Scranton and in Luzerne County and Eerie [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=65.44s)]
*  and Northampton. And that's where you have physically seen them nonstop. And those are [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=74.88s)]
*  the counties that are going to decide this race. Pennsylvania has moved rightward, and I don't [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=82.0s)]
*  think a lot of people have known that incremental change. So Musk said this in an interview. He said [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=87.52s)]
*  that he recognizes that the people here in Butler and in places all across the country not located [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=93.6s)]
*  in the center of power and wealth are the ones most concerned about protecting and preserving [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=98.72s)]
*  both free speech and the Second Amendment. And I guess my question is when you look at it in the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=103.6s)]
*  race right now, according to our Fox News poll, Harris is at 50 percent and Donald Trump is at [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=108.55999999999999s)]
*  48 percent. But that's in the margin of error. So it's a dead heat right now. I'm curious, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  what is the number one issue for people in the state that you're hearing? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=120.08s)]
*  Oh, it's the economy. It really is the economy. Costs have never gone down. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=125.28s)]
*  Yes, inflation has gone down. But those costs that peaked at nine percent are still there. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=132.32000000000002s)]
*  They never moved. And they've still moved up incrementally at two percent, three percent [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  since that high water mark. And voters are feeling that pinch, not just with their groceries, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=144.24s)]
*  not just with gas, although that's gone down a little bit, but also insurance costs and costs [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=150.0s)]
*  to build things, improve their homes. You know, everything is sort of at a standstill. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=156.48s)]
*  And people are making choices they didn't think they'd have to expect to make because of how their [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=162.48s)]
*  pocketbook is being pinched. So, Selena, bring it up. Former President Barack Obama, everyone [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  knows he's a good speaker. He is smooth, but he is not on the ticket. He's going to be campaigning [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  in Pittsburgh. Does he play a role? Is that any impact on voters in the state of Pennsylvania? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=181.92s)]
*  So Barack Obama is coming back to a state that has changed wildly since he won first in 2008 [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=190.88s)]
*  and then in 2012. People tend to forget that he earned three hundred thousand less Pennsylvania [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=197.92s)]
*  voters in that second election cycle. And, you know, what is interesting to me about the Obama [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=204.64s)]
*  event in Pittsburgh is that it is very much like the events that Harris has held. Nobody knows [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=212.72s)]
*  what it's going to be. It's invite only. So you're not able to measure enthusiasm. And so I think a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  surrogate is good. Obama is good. But who's going to see him? Who's going to get excited about it? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=227.44s)]
*  What vote is going to change? Yeah, it's interesting because he was so great at community [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=234.24s)]
*  organizing. And it looks like this campaign is really not focused on that. So it's going to be [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=239.68s)]
*  interesting to see Election Day, how it all plays out. Selena, you predict a lot of stuff. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=246.08s)]
*  We'll be looking forward to your final prediction. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMA7ADilKY8&t=251.92000000000002s)]
