# Paris Hilton turns trauma into 'true purpose' on Capitol Hill
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI)
*  So Paris Hilton is known for her reality TV success. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=0.0s)]
*  She was really the first reality star in Wild Child passed. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=4.88s)]
*  But the physical and verbal abuse she suffered at an institution for [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=7.96s)]
*  troubled teens led her to a bigger purpose. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=11.56s)]
*  Hilton has spent years lobbying lawmakers and now the Stop Institutional Child [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=14.24s)]
*  Abuse Act has passed in the Senate. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=18.56s)]
*  But still needs to pass the House before the end of the session, but it is likely. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=21.62s)]
*  So I talked to Paris yesterday in Washington DC about what she hopes to see happen. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=25.7s)]
*  Paris, welcome back. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=32.42s)]
*  You talked about the need to get this done. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=33.9s)]
*  The Senate overwhelmingly sponsor passed it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=36.42s)]
*  House about to do it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=39.82s)]
*  And now you have all these sponsors on both sides of the aisle. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=41.3s)]
*  What does this mean to you? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=44.5s)]
*  This means the world to me. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=48.14s)]
*  I feel so incredibly proud. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=50.54s)]
*  I just am here to celebrate and I am just so [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=53.66s)]
*  just grateful to everybody here in DC for helping make this happen to protect children. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=59.14s)]
*  Especially teens. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=65.58s)]
*  So teens get in trouble. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=66.74s)]
*  They think they're going to a facility, maybe help parents they maybe can't handle. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  A teen like yourself, you went in four different institutions. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=72.69999999999999s)]
*  What will this act do for those kids when they go into these facilities? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=76.22s)]
*  This is going to be so that they're right now there is no transparency. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=80.86s)]
*  People have no idea what's happening behind closed doors. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=88.74s)]
*  And this bill is really going to make it so [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=91.78s)]
*  that people understand that they're being watched. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=93.98s)]
*  And that everything is going to be put out and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=96.98s)]
*  instead of everything just being hidden from the world. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=101.02s)]
*  People are now going to see what is happening so [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=103.86s)]
*  that families can know what are the good places, what are the bad places. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=106.22s)]
*  And just know what's happening inside. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=110.62s)]
*  You said your parents felt victim to marketing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=112.7s)]
*  That these teen facilities were going to help straighten out you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=115.06s)]
*  You're a bit of a, I guess a wild kid that your parents felt needed some professional help. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=118.22s)]
*  But what was really happening as opposed to the marketing [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=123.66s)]
*  brochures that fell on your kitchen table? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=126.66s)]
*  There's so much deceptive marketing and they market it differently to different people. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=131.14s)]
*  And my family was told it was an emotional growth boarding school. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=135.98s)]
*  And it was somewhere where I would be horseback riding and it was this beautiful place. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=141.5s)]
*  And they had all these fake brochures with photos that were not even of the locations. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=146.18s)]
*  And it was just a complete scam. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  And my family was lied to and manipulated. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=153.62s)]
*  And they have just been so heartbroken just to hear about all of the horrible things that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=156.82s)]
*  happened to myself and so many others. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=162.22s)]
*  So now, if you're a 13-year-old and you go to one of these facilities, you now have rights? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  You have phone numbers to call? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=169.78s)]
*  You have things you can do if you feel like you're being abused? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=171.5s)]
*  Well, now they'll be able to speak to their families without people monitoring. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  So that's when abuse happens, when somebody can't speak freely. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=182.5s)]
*  And even with myself, my family had no idea what was happening because anytime I tried [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=187.45999999999998s)]
*  to say something, they would immediately hang up the phone and the staff would punish me. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=193.29999999999998s)]
*  So it was terrifying. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=198.89999999999998s)]
*  And it just breaks my heart that there's hundreds of thousands of children, you know, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  that are being sent to these places every single year. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=205.17999999999998s)]
*  And it's a $23 billion a year industry of taxpayers' money going into these places. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=207.98s)]
*  And it's ridiculous and it needs to stop. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=213.7s)]
*  So this is why I've been fighting so hard and coming here for so many years and putting [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  everything in my power to help and stop this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=222.28s)]
*  Using your star power, your influence to influence lawmakers. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  You've got Democrats and Republicans coming, rallying around this, then the House. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  And I imagine President Biden is going to sign this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=233.8s)]
*  Do you have assurances of that? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=237.08s)]
*  Well, I told myself that I would never forgive myself if it didn't pass and I did not come here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=241.4s)]
*  So that's why I got on a plane at 6 a.m. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=247.24s)]
*  yesterday, flew down here, because I wanted everyone to know how important this is to me. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  And I'm so grateful. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=255.0s)]
*  I got a call yesterday from Leadership Skalise. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=256.76s)]
*  Just so grateful to him and to all my sponsors. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=260.2s)]
*  And I'm so proud that it passed in the Senate unanimously with all 100 senators. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=264.04s)]
*  And it really just shows the power of love and doing the right thing for children, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=269.88s)]
*  because children are our future. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=276.68s)]
*  So, Paris, when people see you on the reality show, they act like you didn't have a care in the world. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=279.08s)]
*  You're having fun, having a great time. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=283.64s)]
*  Did you repress these memories, try to put them in the past? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=285.64s)]
*  Or were you acting when you were being yourself on the reality shows? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, definitely with my show, The Simple Life, everything I was doing was a trauma response, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=295.88s)]
*  because what I went through was so traumatizing that I just told myself, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=302.52s)]
*  I'm never going to think about this again. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=308.68s)]
*  I'm just going to pretend it never happened. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=310.12s)]
*  And I'm just going to kind of build this kind of fantasy Barbie doll perfect life. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=312.6s)]
*  And The Simple Life was the first reality show ever. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=317.88s)]
*  So I, you know, after being so traumatized and going through that and then having to be on camera, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=321.88s)]
*  I think it was almost a way to protect like a protective shield. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=327.72s)]
*  And I had no idea that it would be such a success and I would have to continue [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=331.24s)]
*  that character season after season. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=335.64s)]
*  And then I think the whole world just thought that that's who I really was. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=337.64s)]
*  But there was always so much more to me. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=341.08s)]
*  But I just was not ready to talk about it, because it was just too painful to think about. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  But when I heard that it was still happening today, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=349.48s)]
*  and now there's thousands of these schools and hundreds of children have died in these places, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=352.12s)]
*  I knew that I had to use my voice and say something. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=357.88s)]
*  I'm so grateful that I have, because it's been the most healing and empowering experience of my [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  life and has changed my life in so many ways. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=367.24s)]
*  And lastly, out of everything you've accomplished, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=369.32s)]
*  out of everything you've experienced, where does this rank on your Things I Did list? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=371.08s)]
*  I've done a lot of iconic and amazing things in my life and my career. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=377.8s)]
*  But this is the thing that means the most to me. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=383.8s)]
*  This is the most meaningful work of my life. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  This is my true purpose in life. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=388.6s)]
*  And this is what I want my legacy to be. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=391.08000000000004s)]
*  And I hope you can be prouder. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=393.48s)]
*  You should. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=394.92s)]
*  And I hope the next time we see you, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=395.56s)]
*  we'll be at the White House with the president as he signs it into law. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=397.8s)]
*  Thanks so much, Paris. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=401.72s)]
*  I really hope and pray that would be so incredible. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=403.48s)]
*  Happy holidays. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  And thank you so much. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=407.64s)]
*  I really appreciate your time. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=408.44s)]
*  All right, so that was Paris Hilton. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=410.68s)]
*  That bill, by the way, has not passed yet in the House and not put up. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=412.04s)]
*  We're going to ask Speaker Johnson about it shortly. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=415.32s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRcT61LesI&t=418.12s)]
