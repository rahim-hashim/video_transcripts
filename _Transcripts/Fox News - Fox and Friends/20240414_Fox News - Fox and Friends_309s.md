# ‘HISTORIC’: Some Muslim, Arab countries stand with Israel against Iran’s attack
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0)
*  A Fox News alert, the world's leading sponsor, Iran, celebrating their attack towards Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=0.0s)]
*  despite 99% of their drones and missiles being shot down before even getting to the Israeli [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=13.76s)]
*  border. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=20.2s)]
*  Our next guest fled Iran as a child. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=21.2s)]
*  Ellie Kohanin served as a special envoy to the State Department under Donald Trump and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=24.2s)]
*  she joins us now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=29.26s)]
*  Ellie, it's really jarring to see people celebrating in the streets of Iran. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=31.060000000000002s)]
*  You believe that the Middle East has changed in a big way just from yesterday. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=36.18s)]
*  Why don't you lay that out for us? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=41.7s)]
*  Rachel, good morning. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=43.74s)]
*  It's so wonderful to be with you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=44.74s)]
*  Probably to Iran's great dismay, we saw a tremendous historic change in the Middle East [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=47.58s)]
*  yesterday and not to the Islamic Republic of Iran's benefit. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=52.42s)]
*  What we saw was that despite the fact that Iran has tried to create this ring of fire [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=56.98s)]
*  around Israel with its proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, the militias in Syria and Iraq, despite that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=61.46s)]
*  ring of fire around Israel, we saw a Western-led alliance that included Arab states like Jordan [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=68.34s)]
*  and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participating in the interception of Iran's assault on Israel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=75.3s)]
*  We are in historic times where we have both the West and Muslim Arab countries, Sunni [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=82.38s)]
*  states standing with Israel against Iran and really isolating the Islamic Republic of Iran today. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=88.97999999999999s)]
*  That's so interesting because yesterday we saw Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=96.17999999999999s)]
*  saying this would have never happened with me, but you're saying that we're also seeing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=100.62s)]
*  the effects still of the Abraham Accords in this incursion yesterday. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=105.38s)]
*  Exactly right, Rachel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=110.86s)]
*  So this is the outcome of the Abraham Accords, the proudest achievement, one of the proudest [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=112.41999999999999s)]
*  achievements of the Trump administration's foreign policy under President Trump's leadership. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=118.05999999999999s)]
*  We saw the Abraham Accords were the first peace deals in the Middle East in 26 years [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=123.17999999999999s)]
*  at the time when President Trump brokered peace between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=127.5s)]
*  Bahrain, then Morocco and Sudan. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=132.94s)]
*  And so today what we're seeing is that not only those countries are still standing side [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=135.3s)]
*  by side with Israel, but even we're hearing reports of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=141.22s)]
*  participated in some way in this interception yesterday. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  We know that some of the assault from Iran's activities came from Yemen and Syria and Iraq. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=150.56s)]
*  And so again, you have the Sunni Gulf Arab countries coming to the defense of Israel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=157.52s)]
*  Great times and truly in thanks to President Trump's leadership and the Abraham Accords [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=163.28s)]
*  peace deals. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=168.22s)]
*  Yeah, it really shows a big difference in the way these two leaders, at this very critical [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=169.22s)]
*  time by the way, politically for the United States, how they handled foreign policy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=173.72s)]
*  So one, a peacetime president putting together accords and negotiations in order to keep [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=177.62s)]
*  the peace. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=184.24s)]
*  And another one who's just sort of managing and funding wars throughout his presidency. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=185.56s)]
*  Rachel, this is unbelievable because the fact that in such a short time, as soon as Joe [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=192.2s)]
*  Biden came into office, we saw one war break out on the European continent. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=196.92s)]
*  And here we are today on the brink of another hugely potentially escalating regional war [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=202.2s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=207.24s)]
*  So now under Joe Biden, we do have two wars on two continents breaking out in such a short [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=208.24s)]
*  time period. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=213.84s)]
*  And as you said, you can contrast that with the Trump administration not that long ago, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=215.0s)]
*  where we had peace prevail around the world. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=219.72s)]
*  And I would tell you, Rachel, that Joe Biden has been telegraphing weakness from the day [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=222.6s)]
*  that he came into office, specifically in terms of Iran. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=228.36s)]
*  He came into office, he delisted the Houthis off the foreign terror organization list. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=231.36s)]
*  He stopped enforcing the Trump administration sanctions against Iran, the oil sanctions, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=235.64s)]
*  and allows our lead adversary China to buy Iranian oil, thereby strengthening both the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=240.76s)]
*  Chinese and the Iranians. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=245.96s)]
*  And he gave the money for the hostages as well. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=247.88000000000002s)]
*  So they're directly funding them in addition to that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=254.68s)]
*  And so all of these failed Iran policies by Joe Biden has led us to where we are today. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=255.68s)]
*  What I'm hopeful, though, is that I believe in the Israelis and their capabilities. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=261.72s)]
*  I know that they're considering right now what their options are. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  And I know that they take this assault from Israel seriously. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=271.16s)]
*  So I hope that Joe Biden will do the right thing, continue to stand by Israel and members [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=274.68s)]
*  of Congress as well. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=279.56s)]
*  We're hoping they'll pass the Israel aid bill as soon as possible. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=281.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=284.08s)]
*  All the while, China licking their chops, eyeing up Taiwan and hoping we get tied up [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=285.08s)]
*  in something else. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=290.0s)]
*  Really great having you, Ellie. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=291.0s)]
*  We hope to have you back soon. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=292.0s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=294.24s)]
*  Great insight. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=295.24s)]
*  Interesting stuff on the Abraham Accords still holding up. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=296.24s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=298.48s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yYdjgpD_0&t=299.48s)]
