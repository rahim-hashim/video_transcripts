# Hannity: This is not a ‘proud’ moment in US history
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A)
*  Welcome back to Fox & Friends weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, Joe Biden continues to face backlash from both sides of the aisle for his recent [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=4.48s)]
*  handling or mishandling of the Israeli Hamas war. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=8.84s)]
*  With over two dozen House Democrats writing yesterday to National Security Adviser Jake [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=13.26s)]
*  Sullivan, quote, public disputes with our critical ally only emboldens our mutual enemies, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=17.28s)]
*  including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and other Iranian-backed proxies, and makes a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=22.96s)]
*  hostage agreement even harder to achieve. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=27.44s)]
*  Here to react on a Saturday morning, Mr. Sean Hannity. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=31.52s)]
*  Sean, how are you doing? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=34.6s)]
*  First of all, I watch every Saturday morning, so I might as well be on. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=36.8s)]
*  Thank you for the invitation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=40.44s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=41.84s)]
*  You know, I will tell you, we're going to look back and I want to tell you something, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=43.72s)]
*  Pete, this is a moment in history that is not a proud one for the U.S. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=48.04s)]
*  We had a U.S. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=53.64s)]
*  president literally surrender in the war on terrorism while simultaneously abandoning our [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=55.04s)]
*  allies as they fight for their very survival. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=62.52s)]
*  You know, we played a tape on Hannity this week. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=66.04s)]
*  Joe Biden in 2019 say we would never it would be preposterous to ever think of abandoning [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=68.76s)]
*  Israel and withholding military aid. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=76.16s)]
*  And he did that very thing this week. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=79.2s)]
*  Here's the danger is the world is watching, Pete. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=81.64s)]
*  I mean, think about this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=86.12s)]
*  Our allies are watching. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  What have they learned this week? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=88.92s)]
*  You can't count on the U.S. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=90.44000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=92.36000000000001s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=92.84s)]
*  Joe Biden said, well, we'll support you only with defensive weapons, but we won't [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=93.76s)]
*  support your victory in the war on terror. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  I'd like to know, why is there any moral ambiguity? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=102.0s)]
*  What part of what happened on October 7th is he and these lunatics on college [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=105.4s)]
*  campuses not understanding what happened was the worst terror attack in their history [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=111.04s)]
*  based on Israel's population. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  If we compared it to our population, it would be the equivalent of losing 40,000 [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=118.76s)]
*  Americans in a single day and have an 8000 Americans taken hostage and taken out of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=124.56s)]
*  the U.S. Wow. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=130.4s)]
*  And so Israel is now in a fight for their very survival. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=132.12s)]
*  Their number one ally, so they thought, has now abandoned them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=135.84s)]
*  They're going to win the war regardless. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=139.88s)]
*  But not only have our allies watching this probably in horror, but our enemies are [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=142.0s)]
*  emboldened. You know, Joe Biden is not strong enough to stand up to the radicals that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=147.88s)]
*  now represent the majority of the Democratic Party. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=153.92s)]
*  He's not strong enough to stand up to them and say, sorry, this is about fighting [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=156.92s)]
*  radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  Israel has a right to self-defense and their survival is hanging in the balance. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=164.48s)]
*  And we fully support their victory in the war on terrorism. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=170.64s)]
*  They're not asking for boots on the ground. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=174.0s)]
*  They're even willing to pay for the weapons that they they wanted from us. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=176.12s)]
*  But to be abandoned by the president of the United States, it is an abandonment of the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=181.48s)]
*  cause of liberty and freedom. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=186.84s)]
*  The United States president should be the United States should be the leader of the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=189.28s)]
*  free world. He's abandoned that cause and the world now knows it and our enemies know [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=194.64s)]
*  it and they're all emboldened. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=200.04s)]
*  And I'll tell you one other thing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=201.8s)]
*  If you look at the 10 million plus unvetted Joe Biden, illegal immigrants, many coming [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=203.84s)]
*  from Iran and Syria and Yemen and Egypt and Afghanistan and China and Russia, tens and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=209.56s)]
*  tens of thousands. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=216.72s)]
*  Well, I got to tell you, Pete, I'm not confident that 9-11 2.0 or worse is coming. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=218.12s)]
*  I pray to God I'm wrong. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=224.0s)]
*  I don't think I'm wrong, Pete. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=225.28s)]
*  Do you think, Sean, you were hearing this this letter? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=226.96s)]
*  I don't think you're wrong either. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=229.28s)]
*  The Democrats calling out his policy. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  Does this only intensify leading up to the convention? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=233.44s)]
*  Are we looking at a 1968 convention? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=235.8s)]
*  I mean, how bad does this get? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  Look, this all started when the Democratic presidential primary took place in Michigan [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  and Joe Biden lost 18.9 percent of the Democratic Party vote in the primary to people that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=247.04s)]
*  were uncommitted and he lost them to a lot of the radicals that live in Michigan. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=255.84s)]
*  It scared the hell out of him. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=261.16s)]
*  It scared the hell out of Democrats. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=262.96s)]
*  Then they lost 50,000 votes in Wisconsin, another 40,000 in Pennsylvania, three states [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=264.92s)]
*  that could very likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election in 177 days. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=271.6s)]
*  So I think Joe has put his own blind personal political ambition above what America needs [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=278.12s)]
*  to stand for, the cause of liberty and the cause of freedom and the cause of human rights [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=285.6s)]
*  and stand against radical Islamic terrorists that killed 1200 Israelis on October 7th, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=291.8s)]
*  took hundreds hostage, including Americans that Joe Biden hasn't lifted a finger to get [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=298.48s)]
*  out of there. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=303.8s)]
*  Yeah, our allies know that we're absent and our enemies know to take advantage. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=304.52s)]
*  There's no doubt. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=308.08s)]
*  Speaking of enemies and allies, that brings us to a new Fox Nation show you've got, Sean. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=308.8s)]
*  It's called Outlaws and Lawmen with Sean Hannity. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=314.6s)]
*  Here's a quick promo clip. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=317.88s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=319.0s)]
*  Dolan and his allies soon force a showdown with Billy the Kid and the regulators. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  Dolan's posse of corrupt lawmen and hired guns corner the regulators inside a house [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  in the town of Lincoln. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  The battle rages for five days. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=335.52s)]
*  Sean, this must have been fun to put together. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=339.32s)]
*  You know, I love John Wayne movies. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=341.28s)]
*  I love Westerns. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=343.12s)]
*  Love Yellowstone. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=344.56s)]
*  I love Clint Eastwood. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=346.12s)]
*  I love all of this stuff. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=347.24s)]
*  Here's the cool part. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=348.79999999999995s)]
*  I said, yes, I said, I'm going to push through my comfort zone. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=350.0s)]
*  I am so glad that I did because and this was a collaborative collaborative effort. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=353.56s)]
*  The team was amazing. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=359.32s)]
*  It was like a movie shoot. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=360.68s)]
*  We shot this, Pete, on the set of where Tombstone, one of my favorite, you know, movies of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=362.76s)]
*  all time, where that was shot. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=368.8s)]
*  So that was a really cool experience for me. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=370.6s)]
*  And in the process, I thought I knew a lot about Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid and Butch [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=373.32s)]
*  Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=378.8s)]
*  I thought I knew a lot. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  In the process, I learned a lot. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=381.8s)]
*  But here's what I really learned. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=383.68s)]
*  All of those Americans, the pioneers, the individualists that we admire on, you know, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=385.64s)]
*  shows like Life Below Zero or Deadliest Catch, I mean, really tough rugged people, those [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=392.48s)]
*  people that made the perilous journey out West, not leaving everything they knew behind [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=398.28s)]
*  in hope of a better life. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=404.28s)]
*  And those people that wanted to take it all from them, the outlaws, and then these [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=406.36s)]
*  incredible lawmen that rise to the occasion and their stories are phenomenal. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=412.32s)]
*  It's a four part series. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=417.36s)]
*  I'm so proud it debuted with really high numbers on Fox Nation. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=419.56s)]
*  Number one on Wednesday. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=424.44s)]
*  I hope people this weekend can watch it. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=426.68s)]
*  I love doing it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z4VMxYj-A&t=428.6s)]
