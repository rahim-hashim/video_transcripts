# 'IT'S ASTONISHING': John Fetterman warns of PA's enthusiasm for Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y)
*  We point out Mayor Eric Adams, and I think the conversation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=0.0s)]
*  we're having is right, because he, it's just. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=3.24s)]
*  He's an exception to the rules. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=5.0s)]
*  It's notable now, because everyone else is doing it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=6.08s)]
*  But they went after him, and that's also why. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=8.76s)]
*  He knows what it's like to have the government [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=10.6s)]
*  weaponized against him. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Well, there's another Democratic politician [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  who's kind of a zig to everyone else's ag, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=15.88s)]
*  always saying something different. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=17.88s)]
*  And that's Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=18.92s)]
*  And he's saying, hey, look, you drive around Pennsylvania, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=21.04s)]
*  and you see something different about the support [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=23.64s)]
*  for Donald Trump. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=25.52s)]
*  There's a difference between not understanding, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=26.32s)]
*  but also acknowledging that it exists. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=30.04s)]
*  And anybody spends time driving around, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=32.36s)]
*  and you can see the intensity. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=35.8s)]
*  It's astonishing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=38.56s)]
*  I was doing an event in Indiana County, very, very red. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=40.16s)]
*  And there was a superstore of Trump stuff. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=44.44s)]
*  And it was 100 feet long. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=49.96s)]
*  And it was dozens of t-shirts and hats and bumper stickers [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=53.16s)]
*  and all kinds of, I mean, it's like, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=61.64s)]
*  where does this all come from? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=63.04s)]
*  It's the kinds of thing that has taken on its own life on that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=64.52s)]
*  And it's like something very special exists there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=68.4s)]
*  And that doesn't mean that I admire it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=72.4s)]
*  It's just like, it's real. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=74.24s)]
*  My hometown where I grew up has a Trump store. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=79.16s)]
*  You go to Eastern Tennessee where [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=81.2s)]
*  we were for the football game. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  I mean, there were Trump stores in almost every town. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=83.52s)]
*  I mean, it is a different phenomenon. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=86.0s)]
*  He's simply acknowledging that, which you would think and believe [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=87.56s)]
*  translates into outcomes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=91.36s)]
*  Someone like Russell Seppi. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=93.36s)]
*  I think it's notable, so I think I want to say it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=94.56s)]
*  His comeback is astonishing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=98.0s)]
*  It's inspiring. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  Fetterman. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  His physical comeback is incredible. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  And I want to give him a lot of credit for everything [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  that he's done on that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=106.92s)]
*  And as to whether or not, the last thing [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=108.88s)]
*  he said about the connect. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=110.48s)]
*  What he's talking about is the visual manifestation [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=111.84s)]
*  of Trump's support. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  But he said this as much before. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=116.28s)]
*  With blue collar rural voters in Pennsylvania, he said, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  I don't, what did he say? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=121.76s)]
*  I don't admire it, but I observe it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=122.84s)]
*  It's real. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  I actually think he admires it to some extent. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  Because I think he wants to be someone [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  who's connected to that level of the voting public. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  And he sees that Trump is so connected to it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=131.36s)]
*  And so I do think he's a curious enough person to go, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=133.44s)]
*  what's going on here? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=135.68s)]
*  I've talked to people on the ground in Pennsylvania. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=136.72s)]
*  And they will tell you it's real. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=139.32s)]
*  That if you're there, you don't believe that it's as tied [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=141.6s)]
*  as they say it is. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=144.44s)]
*  I'll say this too. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=145.64s)]
*  Somebody who's been on campaigns. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=146.84s)]
*  When a campaign is winning, you feel it on the ground. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=148.84s)]
*  I remember so vividly being up in rural Wisconsin, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=152.56s)]
*  Northwestern rural Wisconsin. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  And DC was saying, Hillary's got this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=157.88s)]
*  And I was like, it's impossible. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm feeling this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=162.48s)]
*  And that's the feeling that he's seeing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=164.0s)]
*  By the way, in Pennsylvania, there [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=166.68s)]
*  are horse and buggy Amish Trump parades going on. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=169.6s)]
*  That's the level of penetration that Donald Trump has. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=174.08s)]
*  The Amish generally kind of stay out of it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=177.56s)]
*  They're doing Trump parades right now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=179.96s)]
*  I was going on the spectrum of lifestyles. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=181.44s)]
*  I think you have Donald Trump over here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=183.44s)]
*  And the Amish. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=185.28s)]
*  Yeah, this guy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=186.16s)]
*  Yeah, talk about that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  He's bringing the Jews, the Muslims, the Amish, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  everyone together. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=190.52s)]
*  It's quite a music coalition. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=191.32s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTau_xStf8Y&t=192.32s)]
