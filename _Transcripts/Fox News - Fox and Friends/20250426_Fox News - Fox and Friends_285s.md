# Democrats have become party of war: Charles Hurt
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo)
*  What I what I like about this is that these are the two leaders alone [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=0.0s)]
*  But what it does remind you too is that remember I remember when President Bush said I'm the decider the decider-in-chief [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  right, these are the deciders in chiefs for their nations and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=10.72s)]
*  It matters what the two of them being able to communicate directly in that moment of peace at a time when people are being very reflective [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=14.68s)]
*  Not just maybe for their own lives, but also the peace of the world [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=21.6s)]
*  There's a lot of responsibility on their two shoulders and I love that image and hope that it's portends something positive [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=24.96s)]
*  I I love that image to a reminder [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=32.8s)]
*  Yes of what happened in the White House the last time that they can forgiveness and peace inside of st [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=35.76s)]
*  Peters, but also the reflection. I mean Donald Trump almost lost his life [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=42.1s)]
*  Just you know, not very long ago last summer almost, you know twice and so I'm sure this is [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=47.2s)]
*  You know going to a funeral on this scale [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=53.88s)]
*  had to have been an [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=57.04s)]
*  Interesting moment for him as well, but I love that he took the opportunity [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=60.6s)]
*  Wally's at this funeral to do something to move us forward towards peace [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=64.84s)]
*  And as I mentioned before blessed are the peacemakers? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=70.38s)]
*  That's the thought I have as I see Donald Trump again working towards peace in the world working towards ending [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=72.88s)]
*  This this terrible war that shouldn't have ever happened whether you like him or not he is attempting to be the peacemaker and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=80.2s)]
*  Democrats in America are relegated to the sidelines watching all of it kind of complaining about a lot of it to the point where [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=88.44s)]
*  You have these bizarre polls that show [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=95.48s)]
*  Democrats have sort of become kind of like the party of war where they are that you know, their view is overwhelmingly that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=99.16s)]
*  We have you know that the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=107.36s)]
*  United States has to back Ukraine forever. No matter what [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=110.48s)]
*  it kind of reminds me a little bit of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  Republicans after [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=117.84s)]
*  During the in the later stages of the Iraq war where they were like, no, no [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  We have to do whatever it takes to win the war and Democrats are like no [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=123.92s)]
*  We just need to figure out a way to get out. They're not Democrats are no longer looking for the way out [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=127.84s)]
*  No, they're not but also I mean not to go back [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=132.36s)]
*  But let's go back there were two attempts at a peace treaty in Ukraine and Joe Biden blew those up [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=135.22s)]
*  And yet here you have Donald Trump again with a man who came into the White House and and in his view [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=141.42s)]
*  Disrespected him [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=147.86s)]
*  Disrespected that moment still trying to make peace. I think it's remarkable [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=149.14s)]
*  I see it a little bit differently in terms of like that with the Democrats now because I [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=152.66s)]
*  I think that if Democrats really wanted Ukraine to win after Ukraine was invaded by Putin [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=157.62s)]
*  Then Joe Biden slow-walked the effort [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=165.22s)]
*  Not giving Ukraine what they needed at the time immediately push back [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=168.22s)]
*  initially, so the war dragged on in my opinion because [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=172.82s)]
*  Joe Biden slow walked them getting them the weapons that they needed and then they dribbled them out over time the same thing happened in Israel [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=176.74s)]
*  Right that Joe Biden and his team were constantly like well, let's not let's let they're so cautious and Israel was constantly saying [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=184.7s)]
*  What we need but we have to and they would go around them and to the point that Israel said we will use our [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=192.05999999999997s)]
*  Capabilities to degrade that of Hezbollah and Hamas to the point where Israel now is [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=198.06s)]
*  In a position to be able to push back against Iran in a way that they haven't before so when you see these polls now [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=201.89999999999998s)]
*  showing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=207.77999999999997s)]
*  68% of Democrats or whatever it is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=209.22s)]
*  supporting [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=211.5s)]
*  Ukraine no matter what it makes you wonder if maybe that you know [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=212.7s)]
*  This is one of the reasons why the Democrat Party it's that lack of clarity and that lack of leadership in the Democrat Party [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=216.9s)]
*  Which is why you have Democrats? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=223.9s)]
*  wrestling with a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=226.54000000000002s)]
*  Historic low approval rating across the board because not only you know obviously Republicans aren't going to support the Democrat Party [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=228.18s)]
*  But even the Democrat Party is not supporting the Democrats and they're 15 points underwater now [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=235.26s)]
*  Because of that lack of direction from the the top [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=240.54s)]
*  I mean just because I mean I think foreign policy plays this much of a role and how the Democrats are they are [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=244.04s)]
*  Now I think how much what's their approval rating something like 40 41% [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=249.9s)]
*  I mean and to me I think that if you even dig a little bit deeper deeper the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=255.01999999999998s)]
*  Intra-party problems within the Democratic Party big [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=259.98s)]
*  generational problems the whole idea that you want to just purge any [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=263.06s)]
*  Moderate Democrat so that they can have more of a pure leftist party if they do that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=268.06s)]
*  They could be in the minority for the foreseeable future. I'm Steve juicy [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cwNI5IEfVo&t=272.58s)]
