# Mike Johnson will remain our House speaker, and here’s why: GOP rep
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE)
*  Speakership up in the air as the new year looms and the battle could lead to delay in certifying Donald Trump's election win as of now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=0.0s)]
*  Johnson can only afford to lose one GOP vote when the new Congress starts next Friday [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Joining us now with some Capitol Hill insight is GOP congressman from my home district by the way back in Texas [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=13.16s)]
*  Pat Fallon joins us now congressman great to see you this morning. What? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=20.26s)]
*  What do you think here is gonna happen in the next week or so with? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=24.48s)]
*  Speaker Johnson, I [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=28.28s)]
*  Think Mike will remain speaker will and I'll tell you why we had an election or at least a nomination in the Republican [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  Conference in November and there were no other candidates the entire conference voted with [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=38.28s)]
*  Not with most votes with all the votes for Mike Johnson [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=45.28s)]
*  So I do believe that were people of our word and we will follow through [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=49.08s)]
*  I mean he Mike's got a great relationship with President Trump. They went to a UFC fight together [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=52.92s)]
*  Can you imagine Paul Bader or Paul Ryan doing that? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=57.620000000000005s)]
*  And Mike's got a very tough job with such a near margin [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  So I do think that we might have to go through, you know [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=64.44s)]
*  But a little bit, you know iron out the wrinkles if you will, but I do eventually think that we will get there [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=68.06s)]
*  We don't want to delay the certification because I don't want to see Joe Biden be [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=73.36s)]
*  President constitutionally any longer than necessary. You know, I did personally to your point [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=77.28s)]
*  I did see him at a UFC fight with Donald Trump [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=81.56s)]
*  I actually saw myself as well at Army Navy with Donald Trump and also saw him at the New York City [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=83.72s)]
*  Madison Square Garden our rally with Donald Trump that relationship has been strong it appears other has been a little bit of concern [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=89.16s)]
*  recently with the CR [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=97.36s)]
*  Here's the question for you. You said there weren't any candidates in the past to challenge him [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=99.68s)]
*  Do you expect any in the future? We haven't we haven't had much luck here today coming up with names of anybody that would challenge Johnson [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  Do you know of anybody that would challenge Johnson? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  No, and that's just it [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=113.84s)]
*  I mean we're a week away and there's been no names whatsoever and it's very difficult to get to 218 when you only have [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=115.12s)]
*  219 Republicans [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=122.04s)]
*  So now what may happen is you might see some people that you know make a little noise and then maybe white light it [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=123.16s)]
*  Which is voting present which we can then that lowers the threshold slightly and that could happen [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=129.36s)]
*  But I do think come January 3rd at some point in that day [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=135.12s)]
*  Hopefully right away Michael be elected speaker. All right really quickly [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=139.52s)]
*  President Trump has called out Panama for its relationship with China [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  Ripping off and President Trump's words America at the Panama Canal. He's also talked about Greenland and that it's necessary for US [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  National security. What do you make of these two statements? I think President Trump needs to be taken seriously [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=155.12s)]
*  It's often said don't take him literally but take him seriously. How literally should we take President Trump here on? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=161.0s)]
*  Panama in Greenland [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=167.24s)]
*  Well, Panama's got to remember that they're a country because of the United States [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=169.52s)]
*  They were a province of Columbia and we paid for that canal and Jimmy Carter gave it away [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  I think I remember being a kid and thinking what the heck did he do that for? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  And I mean it is what it is now [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=181.32s)]
*  But Panama maybe give us a little bit of a discount and maybe charge China a little bit more [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=183.4s)]
*  I mean, we're the ones that are historically tied to them not China [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=188.24s)]
*  So I do think that's probably [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=192.0s)]
*  Quote-unquote as the left would say that there's a there's a method to his madness that the left always wants focus on the madness [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=194.28s)]
*  I want to focus on the method because he gets things done and as far as Greenland goes we did have troops there [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=200.16s)]
*  Of course during World War two and it's in the North Atlantic and it has high strategic value [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=204.68s)]
*  So I hope we can work with our friends, you know the Danes and they're a NATO ally to ensure the security of the West [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=209.4s)]
*  Congressman, I know you're Notre Dame guy [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  I do see that painting over your left shoulder of Notre Dame taking a field goal over Texas beating the Longhorns [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  I can't remember what year that was very good. Yeah, but I need to warn you you now represent Texas [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  A lot of Longhorns in your district not a lot of fighting Irish. Okay, so [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=228.84s)]
*  Careful with that over your shoulder there on national television congressman [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=233.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't mention that when that's the only thing I'm underwater if you ask people where you'd be more or less likely to vote [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  For Fallon if you knew that he's a Notre Dame grad. I'm underwater there [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  That's from the the cotton cotton ball Notre Dame victory 38 to 10 in [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=246.6s)]
*  1977 there are January 7th [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=252.8s)]
*  But like all like many great Texans weren't born there but got there as fast as you could right that's fair [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=256.16s)]
*  Preach preach. All right, congressman Pat Fallon. Thanks for being with us this morning on Fox. I'm Steve Ducey [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-H7A9TeOpE&t=265.28s)]
