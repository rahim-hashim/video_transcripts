# Doocy: Trump is in a honeymoon period like weâ€™ve never seen before
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU)
*  And we've been talking over the last couple of weeks and months now about the mandate, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=0.0s)]
*  but also we're realizing that Donald Trump is in the midst of a honeymoon period like we haven't [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=5.44s)]
*  seen before. His, I was looking at morning consult, Donald Trump just hit the highest net [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=12.48s)]
*  favorability rating since April of 2017. That's right after he took office. A majority of people [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=19.12s)]
*  approve of how he's handling the transition and surveys show the people feel broadly warmer about [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=25.12s)]
*  Trump than they did over the last two elections. And it's not just the rank and file people, average [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=31.04s)]
*  Americans, it's people with the biggest wallets in the world because they realize, you know, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  that old expression, if you can't beat them, join them. Well, they might not have voted for him in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  the past, but now they're voting for him by supporting his transition and trying to make [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=47.6s)]
*  it effective because whatever he does impacts them. Yesterday I was, I filled in on Outnumbered and we [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=54.08s)]
*  were watching this presser of Donald Trump. It was more than an hour. It was so good. It was his first [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=62.0s)]
*  press conference. He really was. It was his first press conference since being elected this the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=67.36s)]
*  second time. And he covered so many different topics from the drones to the CEOs that want to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=71.84s)]
*  meet with him. He talked about how all these CEOs and individuals, which I think is smart on the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=78.64s)]
*  CEOs parts, want to come to Mar-a-Lago and be his friend. Listen to this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=83.2s)]
*  How was your meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook and did you talk about tariffs in that meeting? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=90.56s)]
*  Meeting with who? Apple CEO Tim Cook. I did have a dinner with Tim Cook. I had dinner with sort of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  almost all of them and the rest are coming. And this is one of the big differences, I think, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=104.16s)]
*  between, we were talking about it before. One of the big differences between the first term, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=109.2s)]
*  and the first term everybody was fighting me. In this term everybody wants to be my friend. I don't [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=115.04s)]
*  know. My personality changed or something. But I had, as you know, I had Sundar from Google, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=119.92s)]
*  but I also had Sergey. And we do have Jeff Bezos, Amazon coming in sometime during the week. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=127.84s)]
*  And yet, of course, Elon Musk, another business titan. And then you have people like David [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  Sachs, who's going to be head of crypto and he's going to be head of AI. And he worked with them [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  the whole time. So they definitely want to influence, they want to say in it, but they [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  have a peer that understands their business, started a series of companies, turned into billion [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  dollar success stories, beginning but not ending with PayPal. And then you have people that just [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  want to be a part of it. They don't want to be left out. And I also think that they want to, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=161.36s)]
*  I might be naive, but I also think they want to help the country. And I think they see this as [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  an opportunity to help the country without being put into an ideological box. Because this president [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=171.68s)]
*  is so different than a typical Republican or Democrat. He splits the differences on a lot of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=177.36s)]
*  issues and the party follows him. And the other thing is, I think on some level in 2016, a lot of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  these titans thought that they could have done the same thing. They're almost kicking themselves. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=189.36s)]
*  If Trump could have won, I could have won. And then now they're seeing what he went through, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=192.88000000000002s)]
*  what he's done, the crowds that he got, the popularity that he has, getting the popular [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=197.36s)]
*  vote, and then what he was able to do through being assassinated twice and thought, you know what, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  maybe I couldn't have done that. And maybe I should just dive in. And Elon Musk, I think, made it cool. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=207.52s)]
*  Well, to the point about the honeymoon, not only with the Americans, but also with Silicon Valley, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  for the most part, none of the tech companies supported Trump in 2016. None of them. And so [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  his point when he says everybody wants to be my friend is they're realizing the importance of being [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=225.28s)]
*  close to the president of the United States. And that is why, one of the reasons why, all these [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=229.76s)]
*  tech companies are now each donating a million dollars to Donald Trump's inauguration. You've [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=233.92s)]
*  got a million from Amazon, a million from Metta, OpenAI's Sam Altman gave a million, and so did [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=239.28s)]
*  perplexity. Donating to an inaugural fund doesn't really ultimately get you noticed much, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=245.2s)]
*  but if you don't donate, that gets you noticed. It's like, hey, why didn't we get any money from [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=251.44s)]
*  these people? I looked into it, and you know, so they're all given a million dollars this time. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=256.88s)]
*  For Biden, you know how much Google gave? 300,000. Microsoft, half a million. Amazon, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=262.88s)]
*  about a quarter of a million. So in other words, they're giving so much more money to Donald Trump, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=269.28s)]
*  maybe it's little pennants, maybe they want to have a really big party. It's called the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=274.64s)]
*  inaugural fund. What does that money go to? What does it pay for? To pay for everything. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=278.4s)]
*  A lot of the balls, a lot of the organization. So for the parties, it's not for the administration, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  it's not for... Right, it could go to use for this. But you remember this. And you talk about the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  amount of investigations. They started investigating the inaugural ball, like the inaugural fund, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=292.56s)]
*  remember? Oh yeah. Tom Perot? Yeah. They said, what happened with this? What's going on? I'm [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=296.32s)]
*  thinking to myself, two and a half years later, the Democrats were doing an investigation on [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=300.96s)]
*  where that money's coming from and how it was used. Yeah. Donald Trump also talked, as I mentioned, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=305.2s)]
*  about the drone spotting. He said the government knows what's happening. He knows that the military, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  he says, they know where these drones are taking off and where they're landing. He also talked [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=312.88s)]
*  about SoftBank, and he had the CEO of SoftBank at the podium with him, which is a Japanese [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  investment holding company. They invest in companies that are operating solely in technology, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=322.4s)]
*  and that could be anything from the internet to automation. They plan to invest $100 billion [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=327.44s)]
*  in U.S. projects over the next four years. That is double the amount that Mr. Son, the man right [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=334.96s)]
*  there with him, made in 2016. And so he said, I'm doubling down. And then the president said, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=339.68s)]
*  president-elect said, well, why don't you double down again and give us $200 billion? Listen to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=346.72s)]
*  us. It was a cute moment. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=350.96s)]
*  Double down, president. I'm going to have to double down, you know? $100 billion and 100,000 [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  jobs. This is, you know, my confidence level because that has doubled down. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=386.64s)]
*  A hundred thousand jobs in America. Does that mean chips? Will we vote on chips here? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=393.44s)]
*  It's interesting. In 2016, when he said he was going to invest $50 billion and create [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=398.4s)]
*  500,000, 50,000 jobs, something like that. Some of the investments went to startups. Some of them [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=404.32s)]
*  surged like Uber and DoorDash. Some ran into trouble, but that's always the way things happen [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=410.56s)]
*  with brand new developing industries. This time, it sounds like they're going to be putting this [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=415.92s)]
*  money into AI and AI infrastructure. In other words, the things that make the power and the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=421.2s)]
*  infrastructure and the grid to allow AI to work. That's where the money is, they think. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=428.56s)]
*  So the president's going to be set with the executive orders. He knows what he wants to do [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  in 30 days, 30 plus days when he gets in there, and he's trying to get his nominees across the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  finish line. But people are noticing the different tone they're taking. In fact, the headline of [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  Politico, I think it's noteworthy of going over. And here it is. It says, from big tech to the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=445.68s)]
*  media, the rush to kiss Trump's ring is on. But I think, and I had a chance to talk to him on [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  Saturday, and I asked him, what is your take on this? Why do you think they need to talk to you? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=456.4s)]
*  Because they want to know what's going on. And he goes, how do you feel? But he goes, I'll see [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=462.0s)]
*  anybody. But he's, I'm not going to forget. Right. So and the thing is, I would love him to do this. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=465.35999999999996s)]
*  Hey, Mark Zuckerberg, I understand you feel bad about what happened. You want to be part of the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=470.23999999999995s)]
*  the new administration. Appreciate that. Just do allow Matt Taibbi, Barry Weiss, Michael Schellenberger [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  to go look at the Facebook files. Like, Elon Musk, let me look at the Twitter files. I need to find [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=480.0s)]
*  out exactly what you're up to with the pandemic, exactly what you were up to to make sure I didn't [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  win the last election. And if you said you weren't involved, don't worry about it. But we like to know [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=489.28s)]
*  who was involved. And that's not redemption. It's you have to show to me, you have to show me you [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=493.28s)]
*  fixed it. At first, you have to identify it. Then I will run, maybe I'll have additional trust with you. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=499.28s)]
*  Well, right now, people are trusting him because those those polls that I cited earlier, people are [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=505.44s)]
*  trusting that this transition is going to be smooth and that he, a majority of Americans, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=510.96s)]
*  hope that he is successful. I think like you, Brian, I think call us naive. Just give him a chance. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=516.8s)]
*  You know, we want the best for this country. Everyone. We are the country. We are the country. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=522.64s)]
*  We want it to, you know, I really definitely believe that God intervened in some of this, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=527.04s)]
*  that God is protecting our country in many ways, bringing people together, bringing these CEOs [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=531.76s)]
*  together who are very successful billionaires, and they're all working together. It's, you know, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=536.0s)]
*  I've never seen anything like this. Right. So hopefully they'll give him a chance and it'll [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pLB1u9qDnU&t=541.0400000000001s)]
