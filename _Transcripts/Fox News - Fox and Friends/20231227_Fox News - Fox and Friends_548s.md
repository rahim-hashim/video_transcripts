*  Senator and Air Force veteran Lindsey Graham sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee and he joins us now senator [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning to you. Merry Christmas. Thank you [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=6.0s)]
*  Yeah, after watching your show I should leave New York [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=10.6s)]
*  I was gonna walk around but I'm so sure it's a good idea if you do leave don't take chick-fil-a with you, but we'll talk [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=16.52s)]
*  It'd be the unpardonable sin in New York state chick-fil-a in public [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=22.36s)]
*  You mentioned crime being an issue in New York City and there is there are a lot of issues that we could talk about [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  We want to talk about what trey Yanks was just mentioning [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=32.52s)]
*  Yeah, we are now at what a hundred and three attacks on our troops in Iraq in Syria and then 21 [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=35.2s)]
*  International vessels have also been attacked by the Houthis in the Red Sea. How did we get to these numbers? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=41.2s)]
*  weakness [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=47.08s)]
*  We're fighting the Houthis. We beat the Germans and the Japanese. We should be able to beat the Houthis [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=48.08s)]
*  Secretary Austin and the Biden administration is failing our troops in the field. I admire him [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=54.08s)]
*  He's a patriot, but he's not doing a good job protecting the soldiers [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=60.12s)]
*  I asked him a couple of months ago. Joy what you're talking about. Is there a red line? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=64.76s)]
*  Would you tell our enemies publicly that if you kill an American would come in after you without Iran? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  There are no Houthis. The Houthis are completely backed by Iran. I've been saying for six months now [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=74.16s)]
*  Hit Iran they have oil fields out in the open. They have the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=79.83999999999999s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard headquarters you can see from space [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=84.63999999999999s)]
*  Blow it off the map if you really want to protect American soldiers make it real to the Ayatollah [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=87.55999999999999s)]
*  You attack a soldier through a proxy. We're coming after you, you know [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=92.91999999999999s)]
*  I've watched you over the years because I fought in Iraq and Afghanistan [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=97.63999999999999s)]
*  And I always say I may not always agree with you [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=101.44s)]
*  But it seems like you're the most honest person on Capitol Hill because you say Mars later [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  You say that it may be that we just leave troops in the Middle East and we do it on our own terms [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=108.16s)]
*  Rather than talk about ending these wars. I saw President Bush claim victory in Iraq [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=113.64s)]
*  I saw President Obama say the war was over and I even saw President Trump say that he defeated ISIS [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=117.72s)]
*  Which was largely Iraqi based [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=123.52s)]
*  Militants, but here we are in 2023. We have three American service members injured [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=125.88s)]
*  We have a hundred American soldiers injured in Iraq. We have a hundred American soldiers injured in Iraq [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=130.56s)]
*  American service members injured we have a hundred and three attacks [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=135.64s)]
*  What is the answer to Americans dying in the country of Iraq to make sure they don't fight us here? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=138.84s)]
*  We have to fight him over there [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=146.44s)]
*  The border is your last line of defense not your first is people like you in their face in Iraq and Afghanistan [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  In Syria that keeps them from organizing to hit us here [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=154.76s)]
*  Are you worried about a terrorist attack on our country? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=158.44s)]
*  You ought to be because after Afghanistan all these nut jobs on steroids [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=160.52s)]
*  My view is work with people in the region who reject the ideology keep them disrupted over there [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=164.68s)]
*  You can fight them in our backyard or their backyard [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=170.96s)]
*  I pick our backyard to be safe their backyard to fight you can have it [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=173.56s)]
*  Allies or do it by yourself. I I pick allies. It's a religious war. They're not gonna stop [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=179.2s)]
*  The reason you lost your legs is because they want to kill everybody who doesn't agree with their religion [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=184.16s)]
*  These people are crazy. They're religious Nazis hit them over there for they hit a must and you don't need a hundred thousand troops [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=190.6s)]
*  But you need some people like you Joey who will get in their face in Afghanistan, so they don't have the time to hit America [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  That's the only way to be safe in this war and over the arc of time people in the region will change you see [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=203.6s)]
*  Saudi Arabia changing I wish I had a simple answer. There is no answer other than fighting them over there [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=209.4s)]
*  smartly [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=215.84s)]
*  That's your I want to shift gears a little bit because you I believe are part of the border negotiations [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=216.8s)]
*  I've spent a lot of time in September October December in Eagle Pass. Yeah, we just had [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=222.12s)]
*  35,000 migrants the border over the holiday since December 1st [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=229.36s)]
*  It's more than a quarter million since the fiscal year began more than seven hundred and thirty thousand [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  So today blink in my orcas going down to Mexico City [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=237.88000000000002s)]
*  What do you make is anything gonna come of that in in what is the Senate gonna do? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=241.12s)]
*  Where are these talks? Well number one they could fix this tomorrow if they chose to this is a self-inflicted wound by the Biden administration [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  Trump had the border at the lowest level of illegal crossings in 40 years in December of 2020 December of 2023 [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=252.32s)]
*  We're at an all-time high policy matters. So he told Mexico if you don't help me, I'm gonna put tariffs on all your products [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  Guess what? They helped Biden change that policy. We're being over overrun [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  President Biden has abandoned the border patrol but but the center out of due respect [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=272.08s)]
*  I just want to stop you because you know, there's no doubt that this administration's policies which favors catch-and-release is bringing numbers [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=277.52s)]
*  That's right never seen right but but then while I'm down in Eagle Pass Bill Molluskians in Lukeville [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=284.44s)]
*  We're watching agents 200 to one getting overrun. They'll sit it actually hung out a little while the house went home early [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=290.76s)]
*  You guys were trying to get something done and then you said wow about it's Christmas and you went home [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=298.36s)]
*  Well, they're trying to jam us. They wanted us to vote on a piece of crap bill right before Christmas. I said I'm out of here [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm not gonna sit here and vote on a bill that won't do anything [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=309.24s)]
*  Here's the dirty little secret they could fix this tomorrow if they went back to Trump policies, but they won't do it [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=312.8s)]
*  We're gonna change the law to give them tools to deal with this. Will they use it? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=318.64s)]
*  I don't think so no matter what we do. No matter how we write the law. They want it this way [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=322.58s)]
*  They're either the most incompetent people in the history of the world or they want it this way [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=327.8s)]
*  I think they want it this way [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=332.08s)]
*  So I'm working with Senator Langford who's doing a great job [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=333.44s)]
*  To change the asylum system to put a limit on parole the magnets that draw those policy changes because money policy [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=336.56s)]
*  Policy changes, but you change the policy you got to have the will right if you don't have the will to use the tools [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=343.04s)]
*  You have you go nowhere so to the American people if this problem doesn't get better is because they don't want it to get better [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=349.24s)]
*  It's early January it sounds like you're saying that to fix the border you have to change policies that come from the white [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=355.16s)]
*  You got to change the people so it sounds like you're saying you got to change the president and yeah [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=362.02s)]
*  You're smart [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=367.4s)]
*  I'm saying out there if you're sick and tired of your border being overrun of having to mortgage your house to buy gas and get [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=368.64s)]
*  Shot at the traffic, you know at the at the gas station vote for Trump [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=375.46s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=379.24s)]
*  2024 is just days away. What's your reaction to what's going on in Colorado? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=382.52s)]
*  Trump is of course expected to appeal that ruling. How do you think that's gonna impact 2024? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=386.44s)]
*  I think it won't impact [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=390.88s)]
*  I think the Supreme Court will slap it in a state interpreting the insurrection clause is a bad idea [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=391.88s)]
*  This is a political decision, Colorado. They hate the guy's guts, but you talk about radical [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  They want to pack the Supreme Court the left they want to abolish the electoral college [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=403.40000000000003s)]
*  They want to have HR one national voting. They're the radicals not Donald Trump. So this Colorado [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=407.74s)]
*  Decision won't stand. It's time for us all to fight back speaking of chick-fil-a [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=414.18s)]
*  You know the guy on before me the Christian got that wasn't an awesome [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=427.86s)]
*  Yep, so what a reasonable man what what unbelievably reasonable man [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=433.1s)]
*  So the state of New York where I'm at wants to pass a law to make chick-fil-a stay open on Sunday [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=437.22s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Well, if you can have a Satan Club in high school [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=443.12s)]
*  Surely they can close on Sunday because they believe it's the Lord's Day [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=445.98s)]
*  So Dan Cathy's out there watching us to the chick-fil-a people you stand your ground. I've got your back [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=449.46s)]

*  It's time to push back [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=504.52s)]
*  I'm sure this is a publicity stunt [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=506.0s)]
*  But the idea that the state of New York is gonna make a company change its policies ahead from its founding [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=507.84s)]
*  They want to have one day off with employees to recognize the Lord [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVBqzebntKw&t=514.02s)]
