# Hegseth is the 'right guy for the job,' Sen. Rounds says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8)
*  South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds joins us now. Senator, thanks so much for getting up this morning. Thank you senator [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey, good morning. Appreciate the opportunity to visit. You got it senator. So tell me what is the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=6.24s)]
*  objective of the Republicans on the committee now because we know that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  The the left they're gonna come out swinging Schumer has already made it very clear that this is their time of resistance [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=16.16s)]
*  Payback, so what are you guys gonna do? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=22.88s)]
*  Yeah, look we're first of all we'll respond to their procedural challenges [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=25.52s)]
*  They don't like the idea of not having to go around to the Senate. They'll talk about not having enough information [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=30.48s)]
*  That's a part of the process. We'll focus on what Pete Hegseth will bring to the Department of Defense [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=35.84s)]
*  He wants to bring lethality back in he has a bigger focus on it from a guy who was boots on the ground [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  We want that back in on the top level in the Department of Defense [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  That means talking about how you deliver the best of the equipment and the training [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=51.4s)]
*  That young man or that young woman who is at or near the front lines [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=56.64s)]
*  And that's the focus that we're gonna have is is showing the competency that he has and his experience as a combat veteran [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=60.32s)]
*  Well senator, we've seen these things before we know that the opposition party is going to try to knock him off kilter [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=67.44s)]
*  I'm sure you've had your your ear to the wall. Have you heard what kind of surprises the Democrats have gotten store? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=74.44s)]
*  You never know whether or not they have some information that maybe we haven't found yet [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=81.76s)]
*  But the bottom line is is Republicans will be focusing on his ability to do the job a number of the Democrats [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=85.84s)]
*  while they may talk a little bit about it the vast majority of them will talk about his personal history and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=91.96s)]
*  We've all had our meeting with Pete Hegseth [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  We think he's the right guy for the job, but he's gonna have to in front of the American people [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=99.16s)]
*  He'll have three different audiences [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=103.48s)]
*  He'll have the American people as an audience the United States Senate as an audience and the president of the United States as an audience [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=105.24s)]
*  And his job is to be able to explain and to defend himself when the Democrats come forward will help will provide him with ample [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=110.84s)]
*  Opportunity to respond if they don't provide him with the opportunity to respond in a timely fashion [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=117.76s)]
*  But we'll refocus once again and what we want to get done on the Department of Defense [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=122.64s)]
*  and that means bringing somebody back in who's going to focus on lethality and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=126.10000000000001s)]
*  Being able to assure parents that if they're a young man or their young woman wants to get into it [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=130.0s)]
*  To the Armed Services and serve their country that they'll have every opportunity to have the best equipment possible [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=134.6s)]
*  The best training possible and the best leadership possible and I think that's the focus that we'll have [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=140.28s)]
*  With Pete this morning does he have the votes? I? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=145.44s)]
*  Think he does [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=149.0s)]
*  Naturally, it's it's a matter of within the Armed Services Committee itself and then also on the floor of the Senate [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=150.96s)]
*  But everything that I've seen and all the discussions I have indicate that Pete Hegseth will be the next Secretary of Defense [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  Is there any scenario where it's more than one day real quick? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=162.08s)]
*  Not that I can see right now [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=166.04s)]
*  I think we'll have seven minute turns on today and normally we take five minute turns asking questions and as I've shared with both Pete [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  And his wife this is going to be some really tough questioning coming from Democrats [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  It's going to be personal and they're going to have to to be ready for that. I think he will be okay [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=178.6s)]
*  We'll be watching [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  I think it'll last till 2 or 2 30 and then if he is approved today and gets the votes then he's confirmed right or they [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=185.04s)]
*  Do the vote? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=191.64s)]
*  Do the votes next Monday yep on the 20th next week? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=193.16s)]
*  Well, thank you for the preview sir. Thanks senator. Good luck out there. Yeah, I'm Steve. Doocy [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T1ETHOeVm8&t=196.95999999999998s)]
