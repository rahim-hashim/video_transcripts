# 'MANY MISTAKES': CEO killer's missteps leave breadcrumb trail for police to explore
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY)
*  This is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=0.0s)]
*  The FBI stepping in to help with the nationwide manhunt for the suspected killer who gunned [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=1.74s)]
*  down the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=6.88s)]
*  And we now know the killer may have skipped town soon after the shooting as police examine [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=9.76s)]
*  new evidence, including what they believe is the killer's backpack, as seen in this [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=14.4s)]
*  photo obtained by the New York Post. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Retired FBI agent Scott Duffy joins us now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Agent Duffy, good to see you this morning. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=24.88s)]
*  I can't help but sort of get the sense that maybe NYPD, they have a lot more information [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=28.76s)]
*  than we realize at this point. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=35.44s)]
*  Yeah, good morning, Charlie. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=37.44s)]
*  Thank you for having me on. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=39.94s)]
*  I would totally agree with you in that assessment. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=41.92s)]
*  And law enforcement keeps things close to the vest, and they're providing information, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=45.32s)]
*  and of course, any information that's going out to media through leaks or whatever, those [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=51.0s)]
*  are just enough in order to keep this investigation in the public's eye with regards to the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=55.48s)]
*  recent backpack being located and, of course, all the discarded materials, wrappers and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=63.48s)]
*  bottles creating a DNA profile, possible fingerprint profile. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=70.84s)]
*  And then, of course, all the information that's coming in through the public, where names [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  are probably being provided to them, and those names are just not being given to the public [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=79.52s)]
*  because they have to make the connection. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=84.94000000000001s)]
*  Is that the individual that was at the crime scene? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=87.38000000000001s)]
*  So when the police indicate that they know that he left town, and they know that he left [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=90.58000000000001s)]
*  town by a bus, do they know this because they have a name, you think, or is that information [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=94.98s)]
*  that they've just gleaned from security cameras? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=100.94s)]
*  I would say it could be both, but more so because they are following every footstep, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=106.5s)]
*  and just from what we are seeing with regards to the video footage that's being provided to us, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=114.42s)]
*  that they are able to make a pretty good assessment. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=120.58s)]
*  Hey, he went in and he didn't come out of that bus stop. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  Most likely, he is on a bus out of town. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=126.62s)]
*  So when this first happened and we first saw the video of it, you got the impression that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=130.22s)]
*  this guy was somebody who was very practiced. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=136.02s)]
*  This was a very professionally done job, but then it looks like there were a lot of mistakes made. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=141.46s)]
*  What is your hunch about all that? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=147.62s)]
*  Yeah, I would agree with practiced. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=150.10000000000002s)]
*  So he arrived plenty of time, at least 10 days, that law enforcement knows that he was [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=153.18s)]
*  doing his recognizant mission. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=158.94s)]
*  He's probably going over every aspect of his leading up to the fatal shooting, and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  of course, fairly quick, his exit. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=169.3s)]
*  With regards to those breadcrumbs law enforcement has picked up, there's no doubt in my mind that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=174.1s)]
*  he is proficient, he is trained with weapons, but I wouldn't put him in the professional category [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=179.86s)]
*  because of the many mistakes that have been made, and law enforcement is going to exploit those. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=187.22s)]
*  Scott Duffy, thank you very much for joining us this morning. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=194.1s)]
*  Thank you, Charlie. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GU3U0l4sdY&t=198.02s)]
