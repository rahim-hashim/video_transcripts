# Country star Jason Aldean feels 'vindicated' for steadfast Trump support
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk)
*  And I was there as Jason extended his set because the president was run a little late. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=0.0s)]
*  Country music sensation Jason Aldean to my immediate left. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=5.8s)]
*  Jason, welcome back to the show. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=9.0s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=10.52s)]
*  Thank you so much, man. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=11.52s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=12.52s)]
*  Well, great job last night. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=13.52s)]
*  I don't know if you could see it was so dark, but you had thousands of people transfixed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=14.52s)]
*  It was, it was, every time I think I've done it all, like I've done a lot of different [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=18.6s)]
*  things and I've seen a lot of things. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=23.56s)]
*  This was a whole different ball game for me. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=26.44s)]
*  So just a huge honor to be here and to be a part of that night and all the people that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=28.0s)]
*  were there to support President Trump and just, you know, I told somebody the other [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=32.56s)]
*  day it's just, they were like, what's it like to be there? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=37.04s)]
*  I'm like, it's just kind of feels electric. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=39.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=40.8s)]
*  It's just everybody's just excited and just kind of for this new chapter of where we're [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=41.8s)]
*  headed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  We know a lot of the country music fan base is conservative, but some of the stars didn't [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  take the risk that you did. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=52.36s)]
*  Do you feel kind of vindicated right now? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=55.16s)]
*  Cause it seems like you were in the minority opinion. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=57.04s)]
*  Now, now you're the majority right now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=59.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I do feel a little vindicated. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=61.68s)]
*  You know, it's my wife and I talk about this all the time. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=64.84s)]
*  It's like for the last, you know, six, four years, especially, it's just been, you know, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=67.16s)]
*  taking a lot of heat for, for stepping out and kind of telling people how we feel about [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=73.12s)]
*  the state of the country and the, that regime that had been in office. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=79.08s)]
*  And, you know, and so it's been a little, it's been a little odd at times, but it's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  cool to look here this week and see all the, you know, celebrities and people that are [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=89.12s)]
*  showing up that didn't really speak out before. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=92.92s)]
*  But you know, it's, it's a good thing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=96.88s)]
*  You know, I think it just means that, you know, hopefully it's getting everything back [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=98.44s)]
*  in track and people, we're all getting on the same page. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=103.48s)]
*  And I'm sure you've noticed this. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=106.0s)]
*  We've had dozens of people come up to us and just say they were so excited to be in Washington [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=108.52s)]
*  for this particular part of American history, but also because of what it means. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=114.48s)]
*  It means, you know, like Donald Trump yesterday, he changed a whole bunch of stuff with his [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=119.88s)]
*  chisel tip Sharpie. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=125.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think he fixed a lot of things too. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=126.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=129.0s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, it is, it's just, you know, I think for the last few years, as much as [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=130.0s)]
*  a lot of the media has tried to make it seem like everything's been so great, like it's, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=135.0s)]
*  it hasn't. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=139.6s)]
*  And so I think a lot of us knew that for a long time. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=140.6s)]
*  And I think a lot of other people are starting to see it now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=143.36s)]
*  So to have President Trump back in office, I just think everybody gives everybody a sense [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=145.4s)]
*  of relief and for a lot of people, a sense of relief and feel like we're headed in the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=149.84s)]
*  right direction. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=154.0s)]
*  Jason, we all love your music. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=155.0s)]
*  We've been big fans of yours for a long time. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=156.0s)]
*  Also Carrie Underwood. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=157.64s)]
*  And when she said I'm going to sing yesterday at the inauguration, I was so proud of her [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=158.64s)]
*  for stepping out and not worrying about what everyone else in Hollywood or in Nashville [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=162.94s)]
*  thinks. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=166.54s)]
*  I think she lost half of it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=167.54s)]
*  Yeah, they couldn't figure out the music, but she did a beautiful job. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=169.54s)]
*  And you were telling us during the commercial break how hard that is. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=172.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, first of all, it's a hard song to do anyway. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=174.78s)]
*  And you know, when you're supposed to be singing to a track and you know, that's what gives [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=178.5s)]
*  you pitch reference for the song. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  And to not have that for her to just kind of say, all right, listen, we'll go. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=184.7s)]
*  I mean, that's a that's a big move and that's a pro move on her part. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=189.42s)]
*  So I thought it was great. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=194.1s)]
*  So let's talk about your tour. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enT53TZYKk&t=195.89999999999998s)]
