# Lawrence Jones: The Dems werenâ€™t prepared for these answers
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA)

*  Good morning Lawrence, good morning guys. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=14.0s)]
*  That's right those confirmation hearings continue today for president-elect Donald Trump's national [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=15.56s)]
*  security team. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Here's the lineup. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=20.64s)]
*  Pam Bondi begins day one of a two-day hearing to become Trump's attorney general. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=21.92s)]

*  Sean Ratcliffe to lead CIA. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=28.060000000000002s)]
*  Sean Duffy at transportation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=29.96s)]
*  Chris Wright for energy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=31.76s)]
*  Russell Vogt to run OMB. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=33.32s)]
*  In his opening statement yesterday, Pete Hegseth said politics should play no part in the military. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=34.88s)]
*  He vowed to keep standards high and equal, not equitable. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  He says he wants leaders selected purely on performance and merit. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=44.38s)]
*  He also had this impromptu statement while speaking to Senator Tommy Tuberville. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=47.72s)]
*  We won World War II with seven four-star generals. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=52.94s)]
*  Today we have 44 four-star generals. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=56.739999999999995s)]
*  There's an inverse relationship between the size of staffs and victory on the battlefield. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=59.86s)]
*  We don't need more bureaucracy at the top. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=67.7s)]
*  We need more war fighters empowered at the bottom. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=70.22s)]
*  Now at times Hegseth faced tough questions about women serving in combat from female [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=72.9s)]
*  senators. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=77.34s)]
*  Here's his exchange with Joni Ernst. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=78.34s)]
*  I had the privilege of serving in uniform for over 23 years. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=80.38000000000001s)]
*  Let's make it very clear for everyone here today. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=84.5s)]
*  As secretary of defense, will you support women continuing to have the opportunity to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=88.58s)]
*  serve in combat roles? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=93.78s)]
*  Yes, women will have access to ground combat roles, combat roles, given the standards remain [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=96.14s)]
*  high and we'll have a review to ensure the standards have not been eroded. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=102.66s)]
*  After the hearing Ernst told our colleagues at Fox Digital she will back Hegseth, quote, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=108.58s)]
*  after four years of weakness in the White House, Americans deserve a strong secretary [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=112.9s)]
*  of defense. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=117.3s)]
*  I'll support President Trump's pick. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=118.3s)]
*  I'll work with Pete to create the most lethal fighting force. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=119.98s)]
*  The first hearing gets underway with Pam Bondi at 930 Eastern, then John Ratcliffe and Marco [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=123.66s)]
*  Rubio at 10, guys. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=128.26s)]
*  All right, Lucas, thank you very much. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=129.78s)]
*  I think one guy is going to have a pretty easy day today and that is Chris Wright, secretary [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=131.5s)]
*  of energy nominee because today's his birthday. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=135.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=139.61999999999998s)]
*  So they should give him a pass. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=140.61999999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=141.61999999999998s)]
*  He's going to be worth with Burgum on with Interior, who's kind of overseeing oil and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=142.62s)]
*  gas. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=147.82s)]
*  He's going to have a key role. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=148.82s)]
*  One clarification, Pam Bondi will testify only one day, but her nomination will be considered [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=149.82s)]
*  for two days. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=156.17999999999998s)]
*  The second day is three witnesses for her to against her or for the opposition if the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=157.38s)]
*  Democrats choose that about. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=163.1s)]
*  I don't have no idea about how would that that's to balance out, I guess, the attorney [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=165.62s)]
*  general tradition. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=168.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=169.94s)]
*  The person that's going to have the easiest time is Marco Rubio. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=170.94s)]
*  He's already gotten bipartisan support. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=173.34s)]
*  He was in the Gang of Eight, obviously has the experience. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=174.98s)]
*  This is someone that is going to sail through the nomination. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=178.38s)]
*  John Ratcliffe should sail through his nomination considering he used to manage the CIA with [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=181.78s)]
*  his old positions, director of national intelligence. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=187.85999999999999s)]
*  Sean Duffy knows a lot of folks on Capitol Hill was a representative. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=190.78s)]
*  And he's transportation. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=194.22s)]
*  Everyone wants transportation. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=195.22s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=196.22s)]
*  Money for their state. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=197.22s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=198.22s)]
*  And if Joni Ernst is in on Pete Hegseth, mathematically, he's got the job. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=199.22s)]
*  If you missed his opening statement yesterday, here's a portion of it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=204.46s)]
*  Pete Hegseth. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=207.74s)]
*  Unlike the current administration, politics should play no part in military matters. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=209.78s)]
*  We are not Republicans. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=216.06s)]
*  We are not Democrats. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=217.86s)]
*  We are American warriors. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=219.02s)]
*  Our standards will be high and they will be equal, not equitable. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  President Trump also told me we've repeatedly placed people atop the Pentagon with supposedly [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=227.5s)]
*  the right credentials. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=232.46s)]
*  He believes, and I humbly agree, that it's time to give someone with dust on his boots [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=233.96s)]
*  the helm. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  I've sworn an oath to the Constitution before, and if confirmed, I will proudly do it again. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  This time for the most important deployment of my life. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=245.44s)]
*  I pledge to be a faithful partner to this committee, taking input and respecting oversight. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=251.24s)]
*  We share the same goals. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=257.42s)]
*  A ready, lethal military, the health and well-being of our troops, and a strong and secure America. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=259.24s)]
*  He did a great job yesterday. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=266.6s)]
*  I don't think the folks on the left were prepared for his responses. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=268.88s)]
*  I mean, essentially, when he didn't give them the answer that they were looking for, they [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=273.72s)]
*  just made up stuff. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=276.92s)]
*  Oh, so you're saying this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=277.92s)]
*  He just answered your question and you want to put something else on the record. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=278.92s)]
*  By the way, he did not lose his cool not once, and there were moments that he could have, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=283.52s)]
*  especially when they brought up his sweet baby girl. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=287.92s)]
*  He kept his cool, was focused, measured, and honestly, he set the tone for the rest of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=291.4s)]
*  the nominees as well of how to dodge and weave when these senators are going to be throwing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=296.76s)]
*  outrageous accusations your way. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=302.4s)]
*  Like Senator Markway Mullins brought up after Cain went, Senator from Virginia, when he [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  said, really? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=309.67999999999995s)]
*  He goes, so you're talking about drinking should disqualify you and problems with marriage [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=310.67999999999995s)]
*  should disqualify you or divorces? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  How many of you guys showed up drunk to vote? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=316.28s)]
*  So true. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=318.56s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=319.56s)]
*  If you get divorced or cheated on your wife, you should resign immediately? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=320.56s)]
*  So everybody just was silent. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=324.28s)]
*  Then he said, I haven't been perfect either. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  And just another quick note, I think when it comes to Marco Rubio, they're going to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=329.16s)]
*  try to say, you're different from Trump on foreign policy. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=335.68s)]
*  They're going to try to say, this is your foreign policy, which is like ours, but Trump [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  is over here. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=344.04s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=345.04s)]
*  That's how they're going to try to create a vision. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=346.04s)]
*  He's a hawk on foreign policy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=348.16s)]
*  And Mullin also said, Senator Mullin, after he asked about the drinking, how many of you [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=350.16s)]
*  all have showed up and had drinks before you came back for a vote? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=353.92s)]
*  He goes, you know, all of you all have basically. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=357.76s)]
*  And then he said, how many of you all have cheated on your wives? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=360.52s)]
*  He says, it's so ridiculous that you guys hold yourself to a higher standard and you [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=362.32s)]
*  forget you have a big plank in your eye. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=366.02s)]
*  We've all made mistakes. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=368.68s)]
*  And Tim Kaine went just talking about his marriage vows. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=369.84s)]
*  Well, Tim Kaine was best friends with Bill Clinton. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=373.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=374.8s)]
*  He was Hillary Clinton's running mate. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=375.8s)]
*  Bill Clinton was accused of rape, exposing himself and sexual assault. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=377.08s)]
*  Don't get his troops on Epstein's plane. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=381.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=383.32s)]
*  He's like, I got news for you. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=384.32s)]
*  I've been around Washington a long time. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=385.36s)]
*  There are guys who are in that room yesterday morning who'd already had a drink. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=387.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=391.91999999999996s)]
*  Just women, too. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=392.91999999999996s)]
*  It's just a mimosa. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=394.12s)]
*  Both of them. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=395.12s)]
*  Just saying. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=396.12s)]
*  Both sides of the aisle. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=397.12s)]
*  Both genders have done some nasty things on there. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=398.12s)]
*  So I think Pete did a great job. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=400.4s)]
*  I just think the whole, you know, all of that aside, he's going to be head of defense. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=402.8s)]
*  So I liked his comments when Senator Scott asked him, why do you want to do this? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  And he said, I do it for the war fighters that are sitting behind me. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  I do it for the men and women behind me because there were a lot of individuals from the military [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=417.0s)]
*  that were there yelling USA, USA, USA as he was walking in. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=421.12s)]
*  And they were there to support him. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=424.88s)]
*  And he said, I do this because I love this country. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=425.96s)]
*  Many of you all see me as a TV personality, but more importantly, I'm a soldier. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=429.4s)]
*  And I had to fight and I saw a lot of things I didn't want to see. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=433.32s)]
*  And I came home. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=435.9s)]
*  I've made mistakes. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=436.9s)]
*  We've all made mistakes, but I love this country. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=437.9s)]
*  Well, and for anybody in the U.S. military industrial complex, it must have been terrifying [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=439.8s)]
*  at certain points because Pete Hegseth has got a different view on how they've been running it [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=445.52s)]
*  and how it should be run in the future. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=450.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think he'd like to change things from the foundation. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=453.2s)]
*  It hasn't been going well. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=456.4s)]
*  So maybe we need some fresh eyes on this. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_paxgBnoA&t=457.4s)]
