# Scorsese's ‘The Saints’ actor reveals how Franciscan Friars helped prepare him for role
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo)
*  the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=0.0s)]
*  so him in the flesh, they think I'm right. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=7.36s)]
*  Never pay for what I've done. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=10.68s)]
*  The dentures open to us all. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  This Easter season Fox Nation's docu-docu drama series the Saints presented by [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=19.56s)]
*  executive producer Martin Scorsese returns with new episodes showing the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=24.36s)]
*  lives of history's most famous Saints actor Andrea Archangelie portrays Francis [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=28.84s)]
*  of Assisi in the series and joins us now. So great to see you this morning. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=35.08s)]
*  So tell us about Saint Francis. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's a pleasure to be here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=44.44s)]
*  Um, well, Francis is, uh, is one of the most important Saints we we have in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=46.36s)]
*  Italy and all over the world. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=52.64s)]
*  And it was a huge honor and privilege for me, especially because I grew up with [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=54.32s)]
*  this, uh, image of Francis of my, uh, in the houses of my parents, my grandmother. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=59.56s)]
*  So, um, when I was, when I was young, I did a trip with the church in Assisi, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=68.16s)]
*  which is the, the city where he, uh, when he was born, it was born. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=74.56s)]
*  And I remember it being one of the most spiritual moments of my life. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  And then being able to play him was a huge, huge honor and privilege. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=85.64s)]
*  So he's somebody that, uh, figure that's been in your life. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=92.76s)]
*  Um, and you know, most, for example, Americans know that Saint [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=95.08s)]
*  Francis loved the animals. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  What in the process of, of learning, of studying to do this role, what did you [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  learn about, about Saint Francis that you didn't already know? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=104.84s)]
*  Well, he was a very humble man. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=108.72s)]
*  And what is, I think very interesting about, uh, Saints is that they, first [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=111.28s)]
*  of all, they're, they're people, they're normal people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  It was a person. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=121.76s)]
*  He was just a man with doubts, uh, just like me and just like, uh, anyone else. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  And he was just struggling to figure out the real way to get to God. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=130.96s)]
*  And, but it was very, it was easier than I thought to get closer to him, because [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  you're not with Maddie Leshom, who's the director and producer of the series. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=143.84s)]
*  We try to think about Francis as a man, uh, with his problems, his doubts. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  And this, this idea of humanizing these people is very powerful. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  Saint people were people like us. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  And I had the pleasure and the privilege to live with the, with, with the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  friars in Assisi for a few days before, before starting the shooting. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=170.84s)]
*  Um, and we, I just basically lived with them and did their life. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=176.56s)]
*  And it was a hermitage where Francis used to go and pray when, when he was young. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  So it was unbelievably powerful moment for me. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=187.23999999999998s)]
*  I bet that was powerful. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=191.88s)]
*  Let's, let's play a clip from the, from the series. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=193.28s)]
*  I came to understand that the way of God is the way of love. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=197.64s)]
*  There is no choice. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=202.56s)]
*  It is the way of peace within, but also without. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  So you spent time, as you said, in the film, you were in the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=213.04s)]
*  film, you spent time, as you just mentioned, uh, with some [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=216.2s)]
*  Franciscan friars preparing for it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=219.2s)]
*  Um, tell us a little bit more about what that was like and what you learned. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=221.64s)]
*  Yeah, they, they are amazing people. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=227.28s)]
*  They, uh, invited me there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=230.39999999999998s)]
*  I've actually, I went there with my backpack and I just started speaking [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=232.67999999999998s)]
*  to some friars telling them I have this huge burden. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  I have to play Francis, please help me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=242.48s)]
*  And they, and they call the, the hermitage, it's called the hermitage of, uh, of the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  Ligarchery and, and they invited me to stay with them and to live with them, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=249.48s)]
*  waking up at five, praying with them. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=254.56s)]
*  And the most beautiful thing is that I had the chance to, this is a [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=257.52s)]
*  place in the middle of nowhere. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=260.84s)]
*  You have to walk two hours into the woods to get there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=262.88s)]
*  And then you have the, you can walk into the woods and, and pray basically. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=267.0s)]
*  And I was reading St. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=272.52000000000004s)]
*  Francis writings and it's really hard to describe it, but you just get [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=273.56s)]
*  lost in another, uh, in another universe. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  But in the same time, Francis was just seeking simplicity, going back. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  What's basic and what's really important for us. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=290.44s)]
*  So yeah, it was, it was incredible. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=294.72s)]
*  Well, the saints were real people and thank you for bringing, uh, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=297.88s)]
*  them to life. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=301.76s)]
*  Uh, the new episodes of the saints available now on Fox nation. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=307.0s)]
*  Uh, Andrea Archangel for joining us. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYgm6B_2YDo&t=307.64s)]
