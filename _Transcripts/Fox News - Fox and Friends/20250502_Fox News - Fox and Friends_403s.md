*  It was really a nice speech and if you want to download it and share it with your children [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=117.34s)]

*  you are the one issue we brought up politically was of keeping women out of men's sports and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=128.7s)]
*  Excuse me keeping men at a women's sports. Yeah for the most part. Yes that now I got it [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=135.22s)]

*  They got hurt playing volleyball playing against the guys from San Jose State. It's a problem [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=145.38s)]
*  Yeah, and it's an issue that Democrats keep saying it never happens [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=150.14s)]
*  Republicans says it does happen along with having to deal with men who want to be women who claim to want to be women getting [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=154.14s)]
*  Dressed in the locker room. Here's how that resonated [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=160.42s)]
*  Love sports and I think I should have come here. I think I should have come here [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  Congratulations as well to the women's track and field team for winning two SEC titles this year. That's something as long [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=170.7s)]
*  And as long as I'm president we will always protect women's sports men will not play [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=180.66s)]
*  No [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=194.22s)]
*  They say that's an 80-20 issue no, it's a 97-3 issue I think [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=201.46s)]
*  No, men will not be playing in women's sports [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=206.62s)]
*  I mean that there is something to the day. I guess the polling does suggest is like 80-20 [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=210.3s)]
*  But everyone that I speak to I don't care if they're on the left or on the right. They all agree [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=216.78s)]
*  It's just not fair and to see the young people and their parents in the crowd [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=221.58s)]
*  Roar when he said that just shows you that it's resonated [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=227.46s)]
*  We interviewed two individuals that work for campus reform their correspondents and they just graduated from University of Alabama [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  They were in that crowd and the guy that we talked to Jackson Beals said he was walking into the stadium [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  And he said there was someone trying to rally everybody to do a walkout [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=242.06s)]
*  and it was one of his friends who was organizing this and he just he laughed during the interview because he said only [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=246.02s)]
*  10-people [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=252.06s)]
*  Participated in the walkout. They were so happy to have him there [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=253.18s)]
*  He is a success in Alabama and most of the students there are in-state students and their parents really like him and it's just a [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=255.98000000000002s)]
*  Conservative state so here is Mary Elizabeth Miller the female that we interviewed from campus reform that was in the crowd [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=263.18s)]
*  one of my favorite points that he made was that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=270.38s)]
*  The next chapter of American history will not be made by the Princeton's nor the harvard's of the world [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=274.26s)]
*  But rather the crimson tide I am so extremely proud to be a graduate of the University of Alabama [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=279.58s)]
*  This is where legends are made and I think everyone in my class can say that we are extremely proud to be graduates [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=285.85999999999996s)]
*  We are extremely proud to be coming into the workforce at this time and the most most opportune time in American history [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=293.26s)]
*  And we are just so excited and proud what really stood out to me was that his message wasn't really a political one [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=300.94s)]
*  it was one of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=308.18s)]
*  motivation one of like enthusiasm about entering adulthood entering the workforce and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  Another thing that I appreciated was that I saw people that I knew from my graduating class on both sides of the political spectrum [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=316.62s)]
*  coming together to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=324.22s)]
*  Just support having the president there and support the class of 2025 and all in all just being excited about the future [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=326.46000000000004s)]
*  Some smart kids from my former place of employment campus reform [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=333.94s)]
*  I will say this the president also hires a lot of young people and he is always motivating [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=339.06s)]
*  It's not about your age. It's about what you bring to the table and I think [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=346.14s)]
*  While the speech was so effective is that it was life [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=350.54s)]
*  Experience everybody knows that everyone used to like Donald Trump as the billionaire [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=353.94s)]
*  Everybody wanted to be sort of like him because he was like, you know the successful billionaire [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=357.62s)]
*  Everybody wants to be rich and I think he got back to that when he was talking to those young people [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=362.98s)]
*  Sure, it was a little politics in there. But for the most part it inspired those young people. Yep [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=367.62s)]
*  So the commencement address was a good choice. I'm sure they had a lot of people to choose from [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=372.18s)]
*  I'm think was good move those are risk. He said something like we're inspired but we're not inspired by the Harvard Crimson [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=375.54s)]
*  Which is their newspaper? We're inspired by the Crimson Tide and everyone crazy and Donald Trump. Would you like that? I wrote that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=382.18s)]
*  Did you like that I like that too, right I'm Steve juicy [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2aOnVSao&t=390.04s)]
