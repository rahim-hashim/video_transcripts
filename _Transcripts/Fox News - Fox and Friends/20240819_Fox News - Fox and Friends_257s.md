# 'A coup': Top Dems reportedly angry over Biden ouster
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ)
*  Now let's go to Jackie Heinrich, who is here in Chicago for a preview of President Biden's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=0.0s)]
*  speech tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=5.12s)]
*  I think she's in the arena. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=6.12s)]
*  Hey, Jackie. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=7.72s)]
*  Hey, Lawrence. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=9.28s)]
*  You know, Senator Amy Klobuchar said that there are going to be tears of joy when President [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=10.76s)]
*  Biden walks into this hall tonight because he, quote, literally saved democracy and beat [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=16.48s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=21.32s)]
*  And Democrats see his decision to abandon his reelection bid as another heroic act in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=22.32s)]
*  that effort. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=27.68s)]
*  But for those closest to the president, tears of joy from the people who shoved him out [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=29.08s)]
*  the door seem more like tears of guilt. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=33.16s)]
*  The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd writes, top Democrats are bristling with resentments [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=35.4s)]
*  even as they are about to try to put on a united front at the United Center in the Windy [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  City. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=44.26s)]
*  The president already resented Obama for shoving him aside for Hillary, and he resented [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=45.26s)]
*  Hillary for squandering that opportunity and losing to Trump. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=49.04s)]
*  Even though Obama tried to do everything quietly to protect his saintly status, Joe was furious [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=52.64s)]
*  that Obama was sidelining him twice. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  And Biden is not hanging around after his speech to take in all the tributes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=61.4s)]
*  He will be long gone by the time that Obama and Pelosi speak. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=65.72s)]
*  How are you feeling about your speech tomorrow, sir? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=69.92s)]
*  How are you feeling about your speech tomorrow? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=72.92s)]
*  Meantime, we're getting a better sense of how Harris is using this convention, and it's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=79.92s)]
*  shaping up to have a message that's light on policy and heavy on vibes that it's time [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=84.04s)]
*  to unite and take the fight to Trump. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  I mean, essentially it's much of what you've probably heard me talk about before in terms [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  of just what I believe to be the promise of America and the fact that we're all in this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  There's obviously a lot at stake, but there's also a lot to feel good about in terms of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  the future of our country. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  So this is effectively a big show to say that a new leader is taking the stage with the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=111.12s)]
*  president's blessing and all is good. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=117.12s)]
*  Harris has already won the nomination, by the way, with the virtual ballots. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=120.12s)]
*  This roll call vote is symbolic. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=123.12s)]
*  So in essence, the speeches are really just a way to set the tone that it is time to move [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=126.12s)]
*  on and stop looking at the past, guys. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=132.12s)]
*  And Jackie, to your point about this convention is heavy on vibes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=135.12s)]
*  I was reading that apparently, in addition to Joe Biden speaking tonight, there are during [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=139.16s)]
*  the week, there are going to be five social media influencers and a bunch of social media [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=144.16s)]
*  influencers have wound up with credentials because as every campaign knows, something [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=149.16s)]
*  like half of Americans get some of their news from social media, but something like a third [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=155.16s)]
*  of people under 30 get their news from TikTok. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=160.16s)]
*  So bring in the TikTokers to make Kamala Harris look better. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=163.16s)]
*  Yeah. And you know what? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=169.16s)]
*  This, I should say, is something that this administration has been doing for a while. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=170.16s)]
*  I mean, they had a briefing at the White House with social media influencers. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=175.16s)]
*  You recall at NATO, they invited like 20 or so to come in and cover the NATO summit. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=178.16s)]
*  I don't know how that went over or if people watched it on TikTok, but they are increasingly [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=184.16s)]
*  aware that that's where people get their information and they're trying to reach those voters. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=189.16s)]
*  And some polling I saw a couple of days ago shows that Harris is doing well with TikTokers. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=193.16s)]
*  So maybe it's working, guys. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=198.2s)]
*  The TikTokers will do some talking. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=200.2s)]
*  Thank you very much, Jackie. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=202.2s)]
*  Yeah, I remember when TikTok was banned. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=203.2s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=206.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=207.2s)]
*  Can we get back to that? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=208.2s)]
*  I mean, are the Chinese grabbing all of our information or not? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=210.2s)]
*  The problem is when you have your, when you're running for the highest office in the land [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=214.2s)]
*  and your opponent is using it, you can't not be on it too. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=219.2s)]
*  So can we, we'll postpone until November. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=223.2s)]
*  We'll postpone until November. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  The Chinese have at it until November. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  Brian, here's the scary part. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  Some of your kids may actually have it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  I know some of my kids actually have it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  I think I got, I don't think, wait, wait. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  I think I have one on it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  Okay, there you go. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  Less than two there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  A third, a third of the kids. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=243.23999999999998s)]
*  A third of the Kill Me household. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  And that's the end of our live broadcast. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bAs1aFdEQ&t=255.23999999999998s)]
