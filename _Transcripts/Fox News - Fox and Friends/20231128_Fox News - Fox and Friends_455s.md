# Trey Yingst: Hamas is flat-out lying to me
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950)
*  Good morning, everybody. We start this Tuesday with a Fox News alert. It is one o'clock in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=0.0s)]
*  the afternoon in Israel, and new images show the children who were part of Monday's hostage [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=6.44s)]
*  release being reunited with their families after seven weeks of captivity. There one [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=12.24s)]
*  just jumps off a helicopter. We expect the release of at least 10 more hostages at some [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=18.5s)]
*  point on this Tuesday. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=23.76s)]
*  11 Israelis, including nine children, were freed yesterday as part of the temporary ceasefire [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=25.6s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas. That brings the total to 51 over the last four days. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  So the limited truce has been extended until at least Wednesday, but we've been seeing [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=37.2s)]
*  large dark smoke clouds filling the Gaza skyline over the last hour. Yeah, what's that about? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=42.52s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live in Tel Aviv right now. Hey, Trey. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=47.88s)]
*  Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. It is day five of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=50.88s)]
*  We just got an update from one of the top doctors here at the Ichelov Hospital in Tel [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=57.88s)]
*  Aviv discussing the condition of the patients that got here last night. Those children that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  were released from Gaza as part of this larger ceasefire deal overnight. 11 Israeli hostages [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=66.88s)]
*  made their way out of the strip. They were flown here to the Ichelov Hospital in Tel [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=72.56s)]
*  Aviv. Nine of them are children. These Israelis were taken hostage from a small community [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=77.32s)]
*  called Nero's close to the Gaza border. Israeli officials, though hopeful they will be the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  latest group among many that could be released in the coming days. They're hoping that 10 [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=86.64s)]
*  additional hostages will be released tonight as the ceasefire was extended for two days. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=91.52s)]
*  It's the families reuniting, though, that stands out amid this past week. You can see [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=96.88s)]
*  this video here, the bro Dutch family that was reunited over the weekend. These kids [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=100.36s)]
*  getting to meet their dog again after more than 50 days. You can just see the joy on [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=104.92s)]
*  their faces. We also continue to follow developments from inside Gaza. Right now, Palestinians are [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=108.28s)]
*  using the lull and fighting to gather supplies and clean water at this water station in Han [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=113.56s)]
*  Eunice. Gazans fill up large jugs, unsure about when they'll have the next opportunity [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=118.12s)]
*  to do so. Now, at 53 days in, this is the longest war in the history of Israel and Gaza, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=123.0s)]
*  and it is expected to go on for many more weeks, possibly even months. Guys. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=128.76s)]
*  So go ahead, Brian. Um, Trey, I'm just wondering if we're going to know if the if the pause [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=133.76s)]
*  is going to be extended past these two days, how will we know? How do they inform each [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=139.32s)]
*  other through Qatari officials? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=144.0s)]
*  Yeah, so right now, the Qataris and the Egyptians are actually trying to get this extension [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=146.28s)]
*  extended. There's 48 more hours of ceasefire underway right now, but we did see some live [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  images from the Gaza Strip just last hour of black smoke rising up from the skyline. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=158.28s)]
*  It's unclear what that's from, but it just highlights how delicate this agreement is. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=162.76s)]
*  Any single moment or movement could collapse this entire deal. So the Israelis are focused [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  on getting 10 additional hostages out each day. If both sides are still interested in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=172.84s)]
*  continuing the pause in fighting, they will relay that message through Qatari negotiators. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=177.76s)]
*  It will go back and forth, and the agreement could be extended. But eventually Hamas will [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=182.68s)]
*  run out of women and Children to release. And so there are questions about what that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=186.84s)]
*  renewed fighting will look like once the Israelis start their campaign again against Hamas [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=191.24s)]
*  inside Gaza. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=195.72s)]
*  And Trey, I see that the Israeli prime minister has received the list of the names of the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=196.8s)]
*  hostages Hamas intends to release today. Is that list released for negotiation purposes, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  or is it just to give the families a heads up? Hey, these these people are going to be [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  released. We want you at the hospital to greet them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  So it's a little of both. The Israelis have requested that they receive the names in advance. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=216.88s)]
*  And the major reason is they want to confirm the identities. And even when these hostages [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=224.0s)]
*  are in the hands of the Red Cross and make their way to that southern Rafa crossing between [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=228.88s)]
*  Gaza and Egypt or the Karim Shalom crossing between Gaza and Israel, their identities [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=233.8s)]
*  are immediately checked by Israeli intelligence officers. One other thing we should note here [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=238.6s)]
*  indicate Hamas doesn't know where dozens of the hostages are. They were given to smaller [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=243.56s)]
*  organizations inside Gaza like Islamic Jihad and taken to other areas of the strip. And [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=247.96s)]
*  that's just another line item that could complicate these conversations as the Qataris and Egyptians [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=253.2s)]
*  look to extend this agreement. When we talk about the hostages that are held inside Gaza, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=258.16s)]
*  the doctor here giving us an update on those that were released last night saying that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=263.28s)]
*  some of the Children were malnourished and that they were asking for specific food when [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=267.48s)]
*  they were released. We've also heard similar reports from other hostages that were released [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=271.88s)]
*  in recent days, and it really just gives you a sense of the conditions that they were facing [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=276.04s)]
*  for more than 50 days inside Gaza. Yeah, and as parents, we sorry, as parents, we can all [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=280.2s)]
*  relate to this. We're watching the Children when they see their dog. If you have a dog, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=284.88s)]
*  your kids react the same way they were released. And yesterday you were saying someone had [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=289.04s)]
*  chicken. Some of the kids wanted pizza. We can all relate to that. These are human beings, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=293.0s)]
*  not only human beings, but some of these are so young. There's that 10 month old baby. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  We're about to interview a family member from that family, but we're being told that that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=301.56s)]
*  baby was handed over to a separate Palestinian terror group. Do they negotiate as well? Is [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=305.56s)]
*  there a chance that that baby and their and that baby's family could be on a list? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=310.72s)]
*  It's a great question. And look, there is concern that some of these symbols, these [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=317.44s)]
*  young Children who the Israelis and the entire world were watching so closely to see if they [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=321.0s)]
*  would be freed could be used as leverage by Hamas. And it's it's jarring when you think [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=326.48s)]
*  about the situation here. Hamas armed militants inside Gaza are holding months old babies [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=331.24s)]
*  as as leverage in this conflict that they started. And so there's concern that they [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=338.6s)]
*  may not even be able to locate that 10 month old when that baby was taken. He was nine [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=343.72s)]
*  months old and his brother's also being held inside Gaza. And that also really speaks to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=347.46000000000004s)]
*  the fact there are so many families that were taken in at the same time being held hostage. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  And we know that of the Children that were released and are currently here at the Ichelov [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=357.32s)]
*  Hospital in Tel Aviv, all of them have fathers that are still being held inside Gaza. And [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=360.6s)]
*  at this point in the negotiations, we're only talking about women and Children. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, trade the administration Admiral Kirby was on our program on the story with Martha [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=369.8s)]
*  McAllen and he was asked about the Americans making contact with Hamas. And he said they're [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  having to use channels that are outside of the American government. You've been able [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=381.36s)]
*  to make connections with Hamas. And I know it's a little bit different because you're [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=385.8s)]
*  a journalist. So how difficult is it to make that contact with Hamas? Because all the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=389.12s)]
*  American people wonder where the Americans being released? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=395.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. And when we talk with Hamas officials, they become increasingly [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=401.6s)]
*  frustrated throughout the war. As I continue to question them over the phone and over text [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=406.56s)]
*  message about what they did on October 7th, they have gone as far to blatantly lie when [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=410.96s)]
*  presented with evidence because they simply don't want to tell the truth about what took [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=416.72s)]
*  place here. And so we're able to make contact and get comment from them about this ongoing [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=421.76000000000005s)]
*  conflict. But in terms of the information they're providing, we often will not actually [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=426.56s)]
*  bring to air what they are telling us because I can't confirm it. And a lot of times they're [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=431.92s)]
*  lying. And so we do reach out. We try to do our due diligence on these stories and get [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=436.08000000000004s)]
*  as many perspectives and angles as possible. But when you're dealing with a terror [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=440.32000000000005s)]
*  organization, it's very challenging to get them to tell the truth and to provide accurate [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=443.92s)]
*  information. All right, Trey, we'll check in with you again. We'll try to find out what those plumes [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=447.92s)]
*  of smoke about that you were splitting the screen with for a while. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SFaXw4G950&t=452.40000000000003s)]
