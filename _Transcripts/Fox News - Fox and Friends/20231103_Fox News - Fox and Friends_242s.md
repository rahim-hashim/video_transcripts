# Hamas hostage's brother speaks out: 'We have to save lives'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y)
*  At this hour, U.S. drones are flying over Gaza as Hamas terrorists hold at least 240 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=0.0s)]
*  innocent Israelis hostage, including the family of our next guest. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=7.0s)]
*  Yarden Roman was kidnapped with her husband, Alon, and three-year-old daughter, Geffen. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=11.88s)]
*  Jumping from a car, Alon and Green managed to escape, but Yarden and her sister-in-law [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=17.88s)]
*  remain missing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  While Yarden's mother-in-law, Kinert, was brutally murdered in a video posted by Hamas. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=29.08s)]
*  Well, Yarden's brother, Gili Roman, joins us right now live in our New York studio. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=35.16s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=40.36s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  You don't know for sure that she's alive. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=44.0s)]
*  No. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=45.959999999999994s)]
*  We have a lot of signs in the Israeli part of where she was probably taken, and by that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=46.959999999999994s)]
*  we conclude that she is captured in Gaza and held hostage. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  And since she's in the hands of the worst people on earth at the moment, we cannot know [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=56.76s)]
*  what her current state is. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=62.8s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=64.36s)]
*  Gili, and there she is right there with her family. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=65.36s)]
*  Gili, when you watch the live video and like our correspondent Trey Yanks standing in southern [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=67.48s)]
*  portions of Israel, and you see the bombs bursting in Gaza City, where your sister could [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=73.84s)]
*  be, when you see a bomb drop and a big plume of smoke, what do you think? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=81.56s)]
*  To be completely honest, I don't watch a lot of news at the moment. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=87.36s)]
*  I'm very focused on trying to do what we are doing right now, which is to advocate for [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=90.4s)]
*  the hostages. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=94.48s)]
*  But I have a very deep trust in our military that they are doing things calculatively and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=96.0s)]
*  carefully. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  So I believe that she's not hurt by our forces and that she's held. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=106.4s)]
*  We also know that they are very valuable for Hamas. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=112.48s)]
*  So I believe that they are sheltering them pretty well at the moment. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=115.0s)]
*  But of course, I'm worried every single day is a worry. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=117.92s)]
*  And that can be a worry by this or by that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=121.4s)]
*  Because your sister is essentially leverage for Hamas to get something. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=123.52s)]
*  Right now, it sounds like the administration here in this country would like to see a humanitarian [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=127.52s)]
*  pause to get aid into Gaza and get people like your sister out. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=133.04s)]
*  Does that sound like a good idea to you? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=137.76s)]
*  Yeah, that sounds like the necessary step. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=139.6s)]
*  In my mind, we have to save lives. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=143.2s)]
*  There is nothing higher. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=146.4s)]
*  There isn't a higher goal but saving lives. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=147.4s)]
*  We're talking about over 30 kids, mothers, elderly people. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=150.52s)]
*  So of course, if a pause is needed, this is what should be done. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=154.2s)]
*  You live in Israel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=157.48s)]
*  You're here in the United States to make your sister's case, so that, you know, to push [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=158.48s)]
*  for her release. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=161.92s)]
*  And I know you're not watching a lot of TV now, but I'm sure you've seen the images of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=163.96s)]
*  people in the United States and New York in particular, they post posters with like your [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=168.44000000000003s)]
*  sister's image and it says hostage to bring awareness to the plight of the Israelis. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=173.52s)]
*  But then, an hour later, somebody just comes down and rips them down. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=180.72000000000003s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=185.0s)]
*  It's appalling and heartbreaking to see that people have such an inhumane approach. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=186.0s)]
*  There is nothing wrong. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=190.96s)]
*  There is not a problematic with our desire to save people's life, innocent people's life. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=193.16000000000003s)]
*  So I completely don't agree and cannot comprehend with this behavior. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=198.16s)]
*  I think that people put themselves in the wrong side of history by doing this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=203.44s)]
*  And I think that they just don't understand that we are all together in this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=207.88s)]
*  This attack is not attack on Israel. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=211.72s)]
*  It's attack on the free world. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=213.56s)]
*  It's attack of the jihadistic Islam. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=215.14s)]
*  So if they're ripping those posters, they're probably, they are just trying to tell us, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=216.76s)]
*  we are on the other side and I will, I cannot accept it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=221.2s)]
*  It's horrible for me to know that you have to live in a country that people have this [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=224.32s)]
*  approach. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  I don't think it's acceptable. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, we are on your side. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  We hope that your sister is released promptly. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  Gili Roman, thank you very much for joining us live. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=237.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=240.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=241.68s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1AYQxgc58Y&t=242.68s)]
