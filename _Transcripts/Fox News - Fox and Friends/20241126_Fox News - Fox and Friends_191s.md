# Jack Smith was 'desperate': Gregg Jarrett
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k)
*  All right, meanwhile, charges against President-elect Donald Trump in his federal election interference [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=0.0s)]
*  case have officially been dropped, and his Florida classified documents case could be [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=5.48s)]
*  next following a request from Special Counsel Jack Smith. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=9.76s)]
*  Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett joins us right now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=13.24s)]
*  Greg, we kind of knew this was going to happen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=16.36s)]
*  Once Trump won, Jack Smith's hands were tied because the Department of Justice is very [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=19.56s)]
*  specific. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=25.48s)]
*  He will not pursue charges against the sitting president, and in 55 days, he's going to be [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=26.48s)]
*  sitting. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=31.76s)]
*  Yes, so this is, Steve, no great shock. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=32.76s)]
*  The moment Trump won, Smith's misbegotten cases were over. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=37.88s)]
*  And, you know, he knew and feared that that might happen, which is why he tried to rush [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  the prosecutions before the election. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=46.44s)]
*  And when he failed, then he attempted to harm Trump's chances of the ballot box releasing [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=49.32s)]
*  to the public damaging documents right before the election. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=53.46s)]
*  And that, of course, ignored DOJ rules that forbid it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=57.38s)]
*  Even the judge said that's irregular, but she happily went along with it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=61.66s)]
*  You know, the special counsel, I think, was desperate to help the Democrat nominee win [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=65.86s)]
*  so he could keep his job and continue these vindictive prosecutions. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=70.5s)]
*  Obviously, it didn't work. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=75.22s)]
*  Americans had the final say, Steve. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=77.5s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=79.94s)]
*  Speaking of Democrats, Democrat congressmen from the great state of New York, Dan Goldman [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=80.94s)]
*  had this observation about Jack dropping the cases. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=86.89999999999999s)]
*  I think it is a shame for justice in this country. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  It establishes that Donald Trump is above the law. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=96.1s)]
*  Now he appears to escape full accountability for what were crimes charged by a grand jury. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=99.22s)]
*  Well, with all due respect to the congressman, Trump is not above the law. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=107.34s)]
*  The law says you can't go after somebody who's president. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=110.82000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  Goldman doesn't know what he's talking about. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=117.18s)]
*  He's a freshman congressman and a flamethrower. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=119.22s)]
*  Doesn't know what he doesn't know. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=122.62s)]
*  You know, these two cases should never have been brought. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=124.5s)]
*  Jack Smith was appointed three days after Trump announced he was running for president, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  which tells you everything you need to know. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=132.86s)]
*  No fair or neutral prosecutor would have ever done this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=135.1s)]
*  These were purely political, which is what Jack Smith has always done in his career. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=139.5s)]
*  They were legally weak, based on completely untested legal theories, and constitutional [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=144.66s)]
*  roadblocks were everywhere in front of him. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=150.7s)]
*  Supreme Court shredded the J6 case on immunity grounds, and the high court also said, DOJ, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=153.66s)]
*  you're misusing the obstruction charges. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=160.57999999999998s)]
*  So in the end, there was really nothing left of Smith's cases. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=164.38s)]
*  And it sounds like he will resign before Donald Trump can fire him. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=169.06s)]
*  All right, Greg Jarrett, thank you very much for getting up early on this Holiday Tuesday. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=173.14s)]
*  My pleasure, thank you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=178.5s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JatPzXOxV-k&t=179.94s)]
