# Biden admin is ‘not even pretending anymore’: Marc Thiessen
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w)
*  Democrats reportedly in panic mode, privately wearing Trump could shatter the blue wall after the Teamsters' non-endorsement of Kamala Harris. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=0.0s)]
*  Politico reporting, quote, the Teamsters withholding an endorsement from Harris this week after internal polling showed most respondents backing Trump [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=8.24s)]
*  is sparking fresh concerns that the GOP nominee could have higher than expected support among union members, especially men. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=16.16s)]
*  Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Mark Thiessen. Mark, great to see you this morning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=23.28s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=27.52s)]
*  I think that Trump's win in the union, that's obvious even if it doesn't accompany an endorsement from the Teamsters. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=29.52s)]
*  The question I think for everyone now is, is that indicative of a wider movement in areas where unions are strong, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, that are key to winning the presidency? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=44.72s)]
*  I think it very much is. Look, Donald Trump has made the Republican Party the party of the working class. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=49.84s)]
*  And the union leadership just hasn't caught up. I mean, he won the poll of Teamsters members 60-30. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=56.0s)]
*  You would think that that would mean he gets their endorsement too, but they didn't endorse him even despite that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  They should have given him their endorsement. If they were Democratic, the UAW admits, their leadership admits [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=69.28s)]
*  that Donald Trump has the support of most of their members, but they endorse Kamala Harris. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=76.0s)]
*  So I think these unions have not caught up with the American people because the Republican Party, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=79.36s)]
*  under Donald Trump, is now the party of the working class and I think those people are going to come out for them for him in November. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=84.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's, I mean, everything is about Pennsylvania. Does this tell us something that might happen in Pennsylvania [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=90.56s)]
*  that's not yet showing up in the polls? And, or at least not fully showing up in the polls? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, who's running America as we speak? Joe Biden held his first cabinet meeting in a year, Mark. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  That's stunning. And there was a prominent role. There's a prominent role for the First Lady. Watch. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=110.08s)]
*  Today at the top of our meeting, Jill's going to give an update on the House initiative, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=118.8s)]
*  White House initiative to fundamentally change the approach and fund, how we approach and fund [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=123.68s)]
*  women's health services. So I'd like to turn it over to Jill and for any comments she has. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=131.28s)]
*  So, how's it? So how are yours, kid? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=137.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=139.44s)]
*  You know, sometimes the White House surprises you. When Joe became president, I knew I wanted to keep [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=140.4s)]
*  shining a light on the issues that I'd worked on for so many years. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=146.88s)]
*  Pretty unusual, Mark, especially when people are wondering how on the job is Biden. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=151.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they're not even pretending anymore. We're in full Edith Wilson territory right now. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  Look, the First Lady doesn't have a job. She's not an official. She's not an elected official. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=162.16s)]
*  She's not a member of the White House senior staff, though I remember when Hillary Clinton was [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=166.08s)]
*  First Lady, she actually had a West Wing office. In fact, I know that because it was later in my [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=172.0s)]
*  office. I was the only person in the West Wing who had a full length mirror in his office [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  because of Hillary Clinton. But even then, she didn't take a seat at the cabinet table [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  until she became secretary of state under Obama. You know, so this is quite unprecedented. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=184.16000000000003s)]
*  And a lot of people on the left are saying, well, Ivanka Trump addressed a cabinet meeting once. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=189.12s)]
*  Well, it's different. Ivanka Trump was a member of the White House senior staff. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=193.84s)]
*  And in the cabinet meeting, the senior staff doesn't sit at the table. They sit at the chairs [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=197.68s)]
*  around the table, around the back. And sometimes they're called on to speak. And so and they stand [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=201.28s)]
*  and she addressed that she didn't sit at the table. She addressed them standing up and gave [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=206.16s)]
*  a report on her area of responsibility. She didn't take a seat at the table like Jill Biden. I mean, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=209.84s)]
*  it's just absurd. It's I mean, it's also stating the obvious here. Joe looks different. I mean, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=215.2s)]
*  I don't know if some of the cosmetics that have been done in the past are now ceased, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=221.84s)]
*  that he's not running for president anymore. But we can see it in the video. I mean, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=225.6s)]
*  we can all see it with our own eyes. Joe looks different. All right, Mark Thiessen, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=228.88s)]
*  thanks for deeper analysis than what I just offered. The obvious superficial observation. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=232.08s)]
*  Thank you, Mark. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley Earhart. And click [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGzX4Oui5w&t=236.56s)]
