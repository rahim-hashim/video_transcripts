# ‘The View’ co-host may wear a MAGA hat after making this promise
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs)
*  All right, well, it's time for another pop culture round off, starting off with the view [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=0.0s)]
*  co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=7.0s)]
*  She might have to end up wearing a MAGA hat after she made this promise last month. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=9.24s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=14.36s)]
*  If he does good, if he gets the Israeli hostages out, I promise I will wear a MAGA hat for [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=15.6s)]
*  one day on the show and say, thank you for doing it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=19.32s)]
*  Please don't do that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=21.64s)]
*  She'll knock it right off my head. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=22.64s)]
*  But like we can't, you have to be able to cheer for wins when they happen and then call [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=23.64s)]
*  out relentlessly the wrong dude. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, here to discuss is Fox News contributor, my friend Mary Katherine Hamm. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=29.24s)]
*  You're the perfect person to have on today. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=36.12s)]
*  So what do you make of this? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=38.839999999999996s)]
*  I think that she will look great in red. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=41.92s)]
*  We can already see it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=44.32s)]
*  And a bet, a bet is a bet. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=46.0s)]
*  As every dude or lady who lost their fantasy football league knows and is being mercilessly [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  tortured by their friends right now, you have to make good when you make these promises [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=52.44s)]
*  and no wiggle room about the fact that Biden did it and not Trump, because even the State [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=56.04s)]
*  Department has given Trump a lot of credit for this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=63.64s)]
*  There's no way Joe Biden can take credit for it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=64.64s)]
*  But it is kind of extra delicious because Alyssa Farah was a Trump spokesperson who [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=66.72s)]
*  turned on him. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=72.7s)]
*  And now she has to admit not just that he won and won big time, but he's actually bringing [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  hostages home and ending this terrible war in Gaza between Gaza and Israel. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=79.72s)]
*  Yeah, and I think the principle is correct. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=85.96s)]
*  Applaud what works and criticize what doesn't. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  Period. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  That is that's actually a very good position. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  So let's keep to it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=93.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=94.32s)]
*  Let's see if she actually does it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=95.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=96.96s)]
*  Next, Sylvester Stallone, John Boyd and Mel Gibson are named special envoys to Hollywood. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=97.96s)]
*  Here's what Donald Trump said, Mary Katherine. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=103.83999999999999s)]
*  And she said they will serve as special envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=105.6s)]
*  which has lost much business over the last four years to foreign countries. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=110.0s)]
*  He's going to bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=114.12s)]
*  Mary Katherine, this is an issue that just recently came to my attention from a friend [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  of mine who's a producer. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  He said everything other than the editing is going overseas. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  And he said, as soon as these foreign countries figure out our sensibilities, the editing [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  will go over there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=131.24s)]
*  I had no idea this was happening, but it's important to turn this around, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=132.72s)]
*  It's certainly important economically. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=138.76s)]
*  I love the idea also of Trump sort of treating Hollywood like a foreign country that needs [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=140.12s)]
*  an ambassador. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=144.1s)]
*  And these guys are icons, right, who are going to go out and have that conversation. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=145.1s)]
*  I think the left will whine and say, oh, they're trying to co-opt our art when their art has [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=149.46s)]
*  been willingly co-opted for political purposes over and over and over again, sometimes to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=153.66s)]
*  their disadvantage because they're not serving customers anymore. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=158.66s)]
*  I like that Trump thinks about it as a business. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=161.1s)]
*  Our cultural dominance is largely in part largely because of Hollywood. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=163.38s)]
*  And it's good to have that in the world. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=167.9s)]
*  And it's good to have those jobs here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=169.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=171.62s)]
*  America first, Hollywood is quintessentially American. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=172.62s)]
*  And all those jobs should be here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=176.14000000000001s)]
*  A thousand percent. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=178.34s)]
*  I think they're going to welcome the change. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=179.34s)]
*  Here's another thing that's interesting from California. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=180.82s)]
*  We've been talking all about these fires, Mary Catherine, but who knew? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=183.54s)]
*  Hunter Biden's artwork all burned up in the flames. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=186.78s)]
*  Millions of dollars, they say, destroyed in the LA fire. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=191.94s)]
*  Millions of dollars of his artwork. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=196.9s)]
*  Here's what Greg Gutfeld said about it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=198.74s)]
*  Meanwhile, nearly 200 paintings by Hunter Biden have been destroyed in the LA fires. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=203.5s)]
*  Even people who lost their homes now say it was worth it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  You gotta love that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=215.86s)]
*  This is very tricky because if they're insured, their only value was in getting [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=219.38s)]
*  influence to Joe Biden, who was president. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=225.38s)]
*  Once Trump won, the value is gone. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=227.9s)]
*  So I don't know how the insurance payout works on that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=229.54000000000002s)]
*  They're worthless at this point. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=231.58s)]
*  I do hope that we live in a world where people get insurance payouts and help to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=233.34s)]
*  build their houses before Hunter Biden gets the payout on his paintings. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=237.02s)]
*  Please let me know. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=241.86s)]
*  I think he's going to get the first payout. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=242.66000000000003s)]
*  I don't know how he's going to do it, but he's going to get it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=244.62s)]
*  By the way, Mary Catherine, Pete Hegseth gave me for my birthday a print. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=246.46s)]
*  So so I guess maybe it's up in value now. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=252.02s)]
*  You know, I'm sure by that, it's a it's a relic at this point. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it sure is. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=259.86s)]
*  Love having you on Mary Catherine. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=261.7s)]
*  You got to come back if you want more of her. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=263.26s)]
*  She's on The Big Weekend Show tonight at 6 p.m. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=266.14s)]
*  Eastern. So be sure to catch her. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=268.85999999999996s)]
*  Katie Griff and Ben Dominich all tonight. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=271.14s)]
*  More Fox and Friends up ahead. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9cS4I5tJs&t=275.02s)]
