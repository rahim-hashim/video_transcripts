# 'NO ANSWERS': Host captures footage of drones above home
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM)
*  Rachel Campostuffi captured this video of drones. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=0.0s)]
*  This is in her own backyard and she joins us now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=4.08s)]
*  Rachel, y'all have been seeing these. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=6.94s)]
*  You were saying prayers with your kids [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=8.28s)]
*  and they looked out the window. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=10.16s)]
*  I saw it out the window, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=11.0s)]
*  but that footage was actually captured [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=11.82s)]
*  while I was at the Patriot Awards and my kids were home [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=13.68s)]
*  and they saw it, they ran outside [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=16.56s)]
*  and they captured that video. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=18.48s)]
*  So it's been more than once you've seen this. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=19.72s)]
*  Oh, multiple times. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=21.04s)]
*  This is all everyone is talking about. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=22.6s)]
*  If you live in Morristown, Mendham, Summit, Bedminster, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=25.14s)]
*  Far Hills, that whole area, that's all you talk about. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=29.16s)]
*  Go to the neighborhood apps where you put in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=32.16s)]
*  if you lost your dog or your cat. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=36.64s)]
*  They're all about drone sightings now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=38.28s)]
*  And so I think what you're seeing is first of all, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=40.28s)]
*  no answers, whatever the governor put out was a non-answer. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=42.68s)]
*  Didn't make me feel any better. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=45.92s)]
*  And I just think we're in this era. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=47.36s)]
*  You remember when I had my interview with Donald Trump [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=49.16s)]
*  at Bedminster, I'm like, will you declassify JFK? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=51.58s)]
*  Will you declassify Epstein? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=54.56s)]
*  Will you declassify the 9-11? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=55.8s)]
*  And he was like, yes, I think we're in this era [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=57.92s)]
*  where people want more transparency from government [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=60.56s)]
*  and they are so tired of the lies being told to them [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  by the government. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=66.4s)]
*  And I think that's what you're seeing right here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  People are outraged. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=68.76s)]
*  Three weeks, no answer. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=69.84s)]
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=71.84s)]
*  When we were interviewing those mayors, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=72.92s)]
*  that's what they said. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=74.58s)]
*  They're not satisfied with just being told, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=75.42s)]
*  well, you're safe, everything's fine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  We wanna know why, who's manning these? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=79.56s)]
*  Where are they from? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=81.92s)]
*  Are they from another country? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=82.76s)]
*  Because they told us the spy balloon is going through [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=83.72s)]
*  and they allowed it to travel throughout our whole country [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=87.08s)]
*  before they actually took it down. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=89.92s)]
*  And then we found out they knew it was traveling [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=91.8s)]
*  over the country, that a Chinese spy balloon [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=94.24s)]
*  was going over our country [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  and Joe Biden's government was okay with it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=97.2s)]
*  Now, another interesting little tidbit [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=99.88s)]
*  before we move on to the second topic, Ainsley, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=101.6s)]
*  is people think I know something [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=103.4s)]
*  because Sean is up for the transportation, Secretary. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=105.72s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know anything. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=108.16s)]
*  I have no idea what's going on. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=109.88s)]
*  I'm just as curious as everybody else. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=112.0s)]
*  And I don't feel good. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=113.42s)]
*  They're flying low. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=115.12s)]
*  They're not up high like an airplane. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=116.94000000000001s)]
*  They're flying low. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=119.22000000000001s)]
*  You can see them and they're large, they're huge. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=120.10000000000001s)]
*  These are not hobby drones. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=122.62s)]
*  By the way, congratulations on Sean. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=125.22s)]
*  I forgot to tell you that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=127.06s)]
*  BLM is now threatening. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=128.38s)]
*  If Daniel Penny is acquitted, they're going to riot, they say. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=130.18s)]
*  Can you believe that? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=133.66s)]
*  I think it's really instructive to go back [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  to the time that this happened. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  First of all, crime on the subway continues, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=139.68s)]
*  but around that time, do you remember all the people [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=141.9s)]
*  getting pushed into the tracks? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=143.9s)]
*  That's why right now, and by the way, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=145.62s)]
*  there's been like 20 murders over the last few years [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=147.3s)]
*  in the subway. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=149.94s)]
*  People actually don't wait for their train [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=151.1s)]
*  by the tracks, near the doors. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=153.66s)]
*  They go up against the wall so they can gird themselves [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=155.3s)]
*  in case some crazy person comes and pushes them in. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=158.94s)]
*  That is the environment that the working class people [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=162.5s)]
*  who can't afford black suburban cars [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=165.18s)]
*  to take them to and from work, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  that's the environment they live in. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=169.18s)]
*  And all of those people who have to take the subway [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=170.46s)]
*  to go to work or go home because of that, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=172.56s)]
*  they actually appreciate the Daniel Pennies of the world. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=175.8s)]
*  And if BLM was actually sincere, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  they cared about the people they claim to care about, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=181.24s)]
*  the people who take the subway, the working class, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=183.56s)]
*  they would be organizing against Alvin Bragg, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=185.72s)]
*  against Mayor Adams. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=189.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=191.0s)]
*  Because these are the people who think it's okay [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=191.84s)]
*  that it's okay for working class people to go [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=194.28s)]
*  in these third world conditions to and from work and home. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=196.44s)]
*  That's the organizing that they should be doing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=200.16s)]
*  Absolutely, Rachel, thank you so much. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=202.72s)]
*  Shame on BLM. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=203.84s)]
*  Again. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=205.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=206.52s)]
*  I know I'm not surprised. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just not. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=208.38s)]
*  Sadly, thank you for coming on. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=209.4s)]
*  You got it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvWEtRMnnM&t=210.88s)]
