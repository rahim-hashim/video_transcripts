# Gov. DeSantis fires back at Kamala Harris: 'It's not about you'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8)
*  Meanwhile, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis hearing all that and probably knew it already joins us live from the emergency management headquarters in Tallahassee. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=0.0s)]
*  Governor, you've been there quite often. What's the greatest challenge with Milton as opposed to Helene or others you've had to deal with over the last seven years? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=6.92s)]
*  Well, I think, as Janice mentioned, you know, this is tracking very close to that Tampa Bay area. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=17.92s)]
*  I would note that anyone on the Western Peninsula of Florida, just wherever that eye wall is scheduled to go across now on these cones, that can shift. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=23.959999999999997s)]
*  I think right now they have it just south of Tampa Bay in Manatee County. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=32.6s)]
*  It could shift further north and it could shift further south in terms of having the most immediate impacts. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=36.68s)]
*  But that Tampa Bay area is very low lying. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=43.08s)]
*  Pinellas County, where I grew up, is surrounded by water. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=46.36s)]
*  It's a peninsula. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  It is just vulnerable to storm surge. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=50.839999999999996s)]
*  Generally, this is a storm that's going to be hitting sometime Wednesday night, early Thursday morning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  The water is already going to be high with the tide. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=58.92s)]
*  So that's a huge, huge concern. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=62.0s)]
*  Now, it had gotten up to 180 mile an hour when it was going towards the Yucatan Peninsula and the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=63.76s)]
*  That is a incredibly powerful storm. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  It has weakened since then. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=74.0s)]
*  It may strengthen today. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=75.6s)]
*  The forecasts are that it will make landfall weaker than it is today. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=77.11999999999999s)]
*  Let's pray that that's the case. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=81.39999999999999s)]
*  The surge is going to be a big enough problem and hopefully the winds are manageable. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  Most of the buildings in Florida are going to be able to handle a Category 3 storm. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=89.32s)]
*  So there's a lot going on. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=92.88s)]
*  And oh, by the way, we just had a Category 4 storm impact a lot of people up the west coast of Florida. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=93.91999999999999s)]
*  One of the issues that we saw in places like the Pinellas County beaches and Manatee County beaches was there was a lot of debris. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  And these local governments have to pick it up. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=109.16s)]
*  They have contractors that do it, but it wasn't being done fast enough. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=111.48s)]
*  So I did this weekend. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=115.84s)]
*  I took all of our state agencies, any truck we had anywhere in the state who's involved in normal missions. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  We diverted it over to those barrier islands. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=123.36s)]
*  We're doing a 24-7 debris mission. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  So we've been able in 48 hours with our state assets, be able to do as much debris removal as any of the contractors who've been doing this for almost two weeks. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=128.96s)]
*  We actually had to pry open one of the landfills in Pinellas County because it wasn't operating 24-7 as my executive order did. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=138.56s)]
*  But we've made a big dent in that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=146.56s)]
*  And the issue is, is if you have this debris laying out, it could become projectiles. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=148.76s)]
*  And then with the storm surge, it creates more damage. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=153.44s)]
*  So it's very difficult. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=155.92s)]
*  We're going to get hit basically two weeks on the dot from getting hit by Helene. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=157.04s)]
*  But we felt it was important that we did that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=161.88s)]
*  We also have now close to 40,000 utility linemen in the state of Florida are in route. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=163.84s)]
*  And remember, there's a lot of these workers that are still in Georgia and North Carolina and those places. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=169.72s)]
*  We've had to bring them in all the way from California. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=174.44s)]
*  So they're going to be ready to do the power restoration mission. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=177.0s)]
*  And then we'll have 8,000 Florida National Guard when the storm hits. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=180.12s)]
*  All our urban search and rescue, our Florida State Guard, Fish and Wildlife, all that will be there ready to go. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=185.0s)]
*  So we're prepared for this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=192.04s)]
*  This is not easy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=193.88s)]
*  I think it's been very taxing on our citizens to have to go through this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  Just as you're starting to pick up the pieces from Helene, now you see another monster storm bearing down. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=198.76s)]
*  But we'll get through this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=205.0s)]
*  I think the important thing today is you still have time to execute your plan. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=206.16s)]
*  You do not have to get on the interstate and drive hundreds of miles. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  There are shelters open all throughout the state of Florida. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  In your county, there's shelters that are in higher ground and that are hurricane proof. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=218.92s)]
*  So if you don't want to get on the interstate, you don't have to. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  And there's a wide variety of options. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=227.48s)]
*  So if you are in one of those storm surge prone areas, take action now. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=229.2s)]
*  We have all day today. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=235.64s)]
*  As we get into tomorrow, you're going to start seeing effects most likely on Wednesday afternoon. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=237.4s)]
*  And in fact, Governor, I was down in Florida yesterday. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=242.56s)]
*  And I know that a lot of the stores are running out of water. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=246.44s)]
*  The gas stations are running low on gas. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=249.44s)]
*  A lot of people who were impacted by Helene actually lost their cars. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=251.88000000000002s)]
*  And so there are lines out the door at car rental places for people trying to get out. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=255.8s)]
*  And as well, you've got your emergency services people and the cops are going door to door in these [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=262.68s)]
*  A zone evacuation areas saying you've got to get out because once this storm hits, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  you guys are not going to be able to go and save them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=277.08000000000004s)]
*  They've got to save themselves by getting out now. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=280.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=283.44000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=285.36s)]
*  And so on the transportation, because you raise a good point, the counties are providing [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=285.56s)]
*  transportation for folks that don't have it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=291.56s)]
*  And then the state has entered into an agreement with Uber. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=293.48s)]
*  So if you need a ride to a shelter, you can go on Uber. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=296.76s)]
*  You know, there's a code for Milton relief. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=301.56s)]
*  And so take advantage of that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=304.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=306.12s)]
*  I mean, you should do that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=306.92s)]
*  But yes, you run from the water and you hide from the wind. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=308.2s)]
*  You know, if we end up with a category three storm, most of the places in Florida, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=312.52s)]
*  particularly with our building codes, if you hunker down in and of itself, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=316.76s)]
*  you'll probably be OK. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=320.52s)]
*  But the water, you just can't contend with Mother Nature. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=322.2s)]
*  If you have 10 feet of that surging in, it is incredibly destructive. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=325.56s)]
*  It is not something that you want to mess with. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=329.96s)]
*  So there are options for you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=332.76s)]
*  You have time to be able to do it and make sure that you are safe in your family. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=334.2s)]
*  And oh, by the way, the pets, too, all the all counties and shelters, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=339.56s)]
*  you can bring they have at least one pet friendly shelter. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=343.96s)]
*  We've actually evacuated some of the pet shelters where you've had abandoned pets. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=346.44s)]
*  We've moved them to safer shelters in other parts of the state. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=352.28s)]
*  So there's contingencies for all this stuff. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=355.16s)]
*  We're going to have damage. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=358.2s)]
*  People are going to lose homes. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=359.64s)]
*  We're going to have businesses. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=360.68s)]
*  We're going to have destruction of infrastructure. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=361.72s)]
*  But we can fix all that. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=363.8s)]
*  You got to mess if you decide to stay in 10 feet of storm surge and you die. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=366.44s)]
*  You've mastered the process that everybody gives you credit for because, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=370.52s)]
*  you know, you guys do such a great job with handling this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=373.72s)]
*  We're learning that FEMA now is reporting that there's a severe shortage of disaster workers. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=376.52s)]
*  This is also coming with they're saying they're going to need more money. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=383.24s)]
*  They made out they may run out of money in November. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  So what are your thoughts on that? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=389.24s)]
*  And are you guys are you guys set in Florida to be able to cover your people, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=391.0s)]
*  even if FEMA won't have the money? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=395.56s)]
*  Well, we have what we need right now. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=398.84s)]
*  And so FEMA, we work with them, some of the urban search and rescue. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=400.76s)]
*  A lot of those people are in Florida anyways, but we're also bringing them in [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=404.12s)]
*  from around the country. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=407.24s)]
*  We're also working with DOD to supplement the fuel mission. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=408.52s)]
*  So we have all our requests have been honored pre storm and we anticipate after the storm. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=411.8s)]
*  I don't know what Congress is going to have to do going forward, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=417.48s)]
*  but I will want because Steve also raised a good point about the fuel. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=420.2s)]
*  So the fuel situation is in Florida. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=423.16s)]
*  It's not a supply issue. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a distribution issue because the stations are running through it faster than they normally do. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=427.64s)]
*  We have Florida Highway Patrol escorting these fuel trucks into the gas stations. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=432.68s)]
*  We have a billion and a half gallons that are either in Florida or in route in reserve. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=438.52s)]
*  Our port of Tampa is still open. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=444.52s)]
*  It's still going to be receiving fuel. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=446.68s)]
*  So I think it's more of just when they run out, you got to replenish it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=448.76s)]
*  But we have stocked spare fuel in the state of Florida and we'll continue to do that [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=453.24s)]
*  leading up to the storm. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=458.76s)]
*  And we anticipate you could have some major interruptions at the port of Tampa, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=459.88s)]
*  which is one of the places where we get a lot of our fuel from. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=463.88s)]
*  And so we will work around that as needed. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=467.08s)]
*  Governor, I know Kamala Harris called you selfish. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=470.12s)]
*  She said she's tried to contact you to talk to you about hurricane relief. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=472.92s)]
*  And I know that you've said I think you said she didn't try to contact you. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=477.64s)]
*  We want to get your response. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=482.6s)]
*  But first, listen to what she said. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=483.56s)]
*  Well, we don't have the sound, but she said, you know, moment of crisis, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=485.64s)]
*  if nothing else should really be the moment that anyone calls himself a leader says [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=488.92s)]
*  they're going to put politics aside and put the people first. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=493.4s)]
*  People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=495.72s)]
*  at this moment in these crisis situations. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=499.0s)]
*  There are these are the height of emergency situations. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=501.96s)]
*  It's just utterly irresponsible and it's selfish. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=505.64s)]
*  And it's about political game and shut. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=508.28s)]
*  What's your response? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=510.2s)]
*  I think she should look in the mirror. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=511.47999999999996s)]
*  We've been on an emergency footing for two weeks straight, around the clock, 24 7. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=512.68s)]
*  We've been working my office, our division of emergency management, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=518.68s)]
*  helping people prepare for Hurricane Helene, helping effectuate rescues of people [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=522.68s)]
*  after Hurricane Helene, helping people pick up the pieces of their lives after Helene [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=528.28s)]
*  and then have to also turn around and prepare for the next hurricane. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=533.88s)]
*  And then have to also turn around and prepare for major impacts and maybe even more impacts [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=538.6s)]
*  from Hurricane Milton, be able to have rescue personnel ready to help people. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=545.0799999999999s)]
*  And then, of course, help with the power restoration, all these things to do. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=549.72s)]
*  So that's been my sole focus. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=553.24s)]
*  My focus has not been on dealing with with Kamala Harris. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=555.8s)]
*  I saw the news report. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=560.8399999999999s)]
*  I didn't know she tried to contact me, but I'd also say it's not about you, Kamala. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=562.04s)]
*  It's about the people of Florida. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=566.68s)]
*  My focus is exactly where it should be. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=568.68s)]
*  And I can tell you this, I've worked on these hurricanes under both President Trump [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=571.2399999999999s)]
*  and President Biden. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=575.88s)]
*  Neither of them ever tried to politicize it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=577.64s)]
*  She has never called on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=580.1999999999999s)]
*  until apparently now. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=585.2399999999999s)]
*  Why all of a sudden is she trying to parachute in and inject herself [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=586.92s)]
*  when she's never shown any interest in the past? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=590.76s)]
*  We know it's because of politics. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=593.3199999999999s)]
*  We know it's because of her campaign. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=595.32s)]
*  I have zero time to entertain these political games. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=597.32s)]
*  We're going to continue to do what we need to do to prepare and respond [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=601.96s)]
*  to what may be one of the most damaging storms in the history of the United States. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=605.8000000000001s)]
*  So she says focusing on protecting your people is selfish. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=610.6800000000001s)]
*  I think she ought to look in the mirror. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=614.36s)]
*  And right now, Governor, just to conclude, you have what you need [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=616.5200000000001s)]
*  from the federal government as well as you feel like you have the resources in place. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=619.6400000000001s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=623.1600000000001s)]
*  Every request we've made, and I've been in contact with the president. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=625.88s)]
*  I've been in contact with the FEMA director. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=629.48s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=631.88s)]
*  Harris is not even in the chain of command. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=632.44s)]
*  Yeah, what is she even doing? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=634.36s)]
*  She has no role in this. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=635.24s)]
*  The idea that I should be worrying about her when I'm focused on the task at hand [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=636.84s)]
*  is just quite frankly absurd. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=641.8000000000001s)]
*  So yes, all of our requests have been answered. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=644.0400000000001s)]
*  We have marshalled all state resources that are available to us. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=647.4000000000001s)]
*  It's going to be a very robust response, but it's going to be a lot of damage. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=650.7600000000001s)]
*  And we're bracing for that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=654.92s)]
*  I'd ask everyone to keep us in your prayers. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=656.04s)]
*  We know we're going to get hit, but hopefully we can pray that this storm will weaken [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=658.76s)]
*  and do the least amount of damage possible. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=663.16s)]
*  All right, absolutely. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=665.24s)]
*  Great job out there. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=666.36s)]
*  Best of luck. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=667.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=668.4399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXp7DsrJQw8&t=670.1999999999999s)]
