# Peter Doocy: This is something Trump rarely does
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg)
*  Alright, you talked about the big beautiful bill, perfect segue. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=0.0s)]
*  This morning President Trump will head to Capitol Hill to attend a House Republican [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=3.12s)]
*  conference meeting and urge them to unite and to pass this one big beautiful bill. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=6.76s)]
*  So Peter Deuce, he's at the White House with more. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=11.44s)]
*  Peter. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=13.56s)]
*  And something you don't usually see behind us on the North Lawn, the beast is getting [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=14.56s)]
*  ready to take President Trump to do something that he rarely does. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=18.56s)]
*  He's going to go to Capitol Hill with the full presidential package, the whole motorcade, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=21.88s)]
*  the small army of Secret Service, a dozen or so aides, and he is going to lean on Republican [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=26.6s)]
*  holdouts to get them to yeses on this big beautiful bill. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=32.56s)]
*  If we don't get it, that means the Democrats will have stopped us and that means people [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=37.84s)]
*  get a 68% tax increase, the largest in history. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=42.68000000000001s)]
*  And if we do get it, we're going to have the largest tax decrease in history. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=46.84s)]
*  And all my life I've watched politicians screaming, we will cut your taxes. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=50.58s)]
*  This is the only group where they say we're going to raise your taxes and they think they're [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=54.68s)]
*  going to win. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  There's something wrong with them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  Blue state Republicans want higher caps on state and local tax or salt deductions. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=60.76s)]
*  Speaker Johnson is saying we are continuing to work on it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=67.36s)]
*  It is not a final resolution yet, but I think we're getting very close. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=70.08s)]
*  The White House is warning meantime that failure to pass the big beautiful bill will be seen [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=73.4s)]
*  as a betrayal by the voting public. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=78.44s)]
*  The America first policies in this bill are the reason why Republicans currently have [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=82.92s)]
*  the majority in Congress right now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=87.16s)]
*  And that's why it's essential that every Republican in the House and the Senate unites behind [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=89.44s)]
*  President Trump and passes this popular and essential legislative package. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=95.72s)]
*  President Trump seems to just want to get it over with today. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=101.72s)]
*  He is going to leave ahead of a 9 a.m. closed door meeting on Capitol Hill as the clock [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  towards this deadline that Republicans set for themselves to get the big beautiful bill [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=110.32s)]
*  passed by Monday. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=114.96s)]
*  That only gives them six more days. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=116.32s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  Hey, so so Peter, let's say they get this on Memorial Day or a day or two after the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  Senate takes it up right away, correct? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=124.96s)]
*  And then their goal is July 4th. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=130.28s)]
*  And so this is a big part of the reason why President Trump signed so many executive orders [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=131.44s)]
*  when he first came into office, because it takes even with Republicans in the Senate [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=137.84s)]
*  and Republicans in the House, it is taking forever to get anything done legislatively. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=142.44s)]
*  And so, yes, Memorial Day would be the goal for that House if they can get there after [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  President Trump's visit today. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=152.28s)]
*  And then Fourth of July ish for the Senate. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=153.88000000000002s)]
*  And then President Trump can sign it again if they get there. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  They've got enough holdouts that it might be a real problem. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=160.08s)]
*  And this is a big part of the reason why they pulled Elise Stefanik's nomination to be the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=164.2s)]
*  UN ambassador down, because they are so slim with their majority. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  They need each vote, including hers. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  That's why they're smushing this all together, trying to use reconciliation so they don't [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  have to worry about that 60 vote filibuster in the Senate, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=180.32s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=184.83999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=185.83999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=186.83999999999997s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  Great job. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=188.83999999999997s)]
*  Of course, this process is frustrating, but they're getting all of the president's promises [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=189.84s)]
*  in one bill. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=194.6s)]
*  So we knew that was going to be a little complicated because you've got the border, you've got [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=195.6s)]
*  taxes, you've got everything. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=198.96s)]
*  Taxes on overtime. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=201.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=202.72s)]
*  So a lot of things are in here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=203.72s)]
*  But there's one thing that's just grinding my gears. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=205.0s)]
*  And look, it would benefit me because I have to pay New York taxes. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=207.96s)]
*  But I don't understand how the GOP conference, you have representatives from New York that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=212.32s)]
*  I want this salt deduction. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=217.48s)]
*  It's not fair to the other states. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=218.48s)]
*  You know what their argument is. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=219.48s)]
*  Their argument is that they pay more to the federal government. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=220.48s)]
*  And do you know that the threshold is 400,000. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=223.48s)]
*  You're not going to get anything off unless it's 400,000. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=228.04s)]
*  They want to give a 40,000. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=230.64s)]
*  The policy would lift the 10,000 cap, which is zero, to 30,000, subjected to higher deduction [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=234.16s)]
*  for new income restrictions on taxpayers who make 400,000. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=239.92s)]
*  So if you make 400,000 or less, you can write it off. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=243.36s)]
*  If you don't, you're not. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  So that is going to allow, that was a big cut. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=248.24s)]
*  There was a pay for in 2017. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=252.68s)]
*  Now that's virtually gone. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=255.88000000000002s)]
*  So what are you going to do? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=257.88s)]
*  It's going to add to the spending. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=258.88s)]
*  So that's what Chip Roy and others are saying. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=261.0s)]
*  It adds to the spending. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=263.08000000000004s)]
*  Why are we leaving so much of the New Green Deal in? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=264.52000000000004s)]
*  So here's where the rubber hits the road. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=267.32s)]
*  And I'm not rationalizing it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=269.04s)]
*  What they say, in New York, you got the wind project. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=270.92s)]
*  So the wind project is supposed to be 100,000 jobs and supposed to power for 500,000 people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=274.48s)]
*  Let's get rid of it because it's the New Green Deal. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=280.52000000000004s)]
*  But a lot of Republicans in New York say, wait a second, we need that for jobs. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  And you have people lobbying on that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=287.76s)]
*  If you're an older person, no tax on Social Security. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  If you work in Vegas, if you work in a restaurant, no tax on overtime or on tips. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  It's advantageous for a lot of Americans. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  So quickly, as I was talking about that I'm against the saw deduction, one of the counter [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=297.8s)]
*  arguments that is also being made, to your point, Brian, is that they say that those [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  districts are competitive for Republicans. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=306.64s)]
*  And this is one thing that they could get that could keep that a Republican seat. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=309.88s)]
*  So I do see both sides on it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  But the Medicaid is the thing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=316.68s)]
*  It's reform, not reduced. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=318.36s)]
*  Reform to what its original mandate was for the children and the disabled. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=320.56s)]
*  Obama expanded to the point where it's unaffordable and the federal government's on the hook [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=325.52s)]
*  for 95% of it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=329.48s)]
*  That's what blew up the budget. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=331.64s)]
*  And on the left side of your screen, there he is, just entering the Capitol. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=333.44s)]
*  Now let's see if he makes any remarks. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=337.64s)]
*  Well, it's not a question of holdups. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=339.12s)]
*  We have a tremendously unified party. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=340.4s)]
*  I don't think we've ever had a party like this. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=342.36s)]
*  There are some people that want a couple of things that maybe I don't like or that they're [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=344.2s)]
*  not going to get. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=348.84s)]
*  But I think we're going to have tremendous, not luck, we have tremendous talent. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=350.4s)]
*  The President has done an incredible job as Speaker. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=355.36s)]
*  You know, we had a majority of one. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  We were one heart attack away from losing the House. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=360.32s)]
*  Okay? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=362.92s)]
*  Now we have seven. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=363.92s)]
*  That's a big because we won some elections, as you probably noticed, and we're going [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=364.92s)]
*  to win a lot of elections. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=368.52000000000004s)]
*  We have an economy that's roaring. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=369.68s)]
*  We took out 5.1 billion. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=372.48s)]
*  If you take a look, 5.1 trillion with a T, not a B. 5.1 trillion out of the Middle East. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=374.04s)]
*  They're investing more than that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=381.12s)]
*  It's going to be ultimately more than that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  We've got 180 white body Boeing aircraft. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  They're spending money at levels that nobody's ever seen. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=389.48s)]
*  Usually a President goes for a trip and he loses money. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=392.64s)]
*  In other words, he gives money. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=394.92s)]
*  We went for a trip, but we took out 5.1 trillion dollars. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=396.64s)]
*  Nobody has ever seen anything like it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=401.16s)]
*  And that's just the beginning. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=403.16s)]
*  So I think we're going to, I think we're a very unified party. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=404.16s)]
*  The Senate's doing great. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=407.64s)]
*  John Thune is doing fantastic. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=408.64s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=409.64s)]
*  And we're going to have a bill, the one big, beautiful bill I think it's going to be. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  It's the biggest bill ever passed. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  And we've got to get it done. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=417.15999999999997s)]
*  Tremendous tax cuts for people, tremendous incentives, tremendous regulation cuts, all [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  these regulations that are so horrible. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  And now you found that and find out what happened because Biden, look, it's a very sad thing [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=427.15999999999997s)]
*  what happened, but I really, we're going to start looking into this whole thing with [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=432.44s)]
*  who signed this legislation. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  Who signed legislation opening our border? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=438.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't think he knew. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=440.44s)]
*  I said, there's nobody that didn't want an open border. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=441.44s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=444.44s)]
*  And now I find out that it wasn't him. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=445.44s)]
*  He auto-pended. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=447.44s)]
*  Who was operating the auto-pend? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=448.44s)]
*  This is a very serious thing. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=450.44s)]
*  We had a president that didn't sign anything. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=452.44s)]
*  He auto-ped almost everything. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=454.44s)]
*  He opened the borders of the United States of America. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=456.44s)]
*  And I kept saying, who would do such a thing allowing criminals to border in from all over [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=459.44s)]
*  the world, not just South America, all over the world. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=465.44s)]
*  They came in from Africa. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=467.44s)]
*  They came in from Asia. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=468.44s)]
*  They came from the Congo. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=470.44s)]
*  The prisons in the Congo in Africa, these are rough people. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=472.44s)]
*  The prisons from the Congo are empty. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=476.44s)]
*  You know where they are? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=479.44s)]
*  They're in this country. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=480.44s)]
*  Who would sign this? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=481.44s)]
*  Nobody would sign it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=483.44s)]
*  No sane person would sign it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=484.44s)]
*  You know who signed it? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=486.44s)]
*  Radical F. Lunatics that were running our country and the auto-pend signed it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=487.44s)]
*  And they didn't want him and they were disappointed in getting him because they wanted Bernie [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=491.44s)]
*  Sanders. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=495.44s)]
*  And then after about two weeks, they said, wait a minute, this is a gift. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=496.44s)]
*  He'll do anything. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=500.44s)]
*  We're going to use the auto-pend. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=502.44s)]
*  And they used the auto-pend and everything. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=504.44s)]
*  He didn't approve this stuff because when Joe Biden was with it, he would never have [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=506.44s)]
*  approved it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=511.44s)]
*  You take a look. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=512.44s)]
*  He would have never approved open borders. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=513.44s)]
*  Go ahead, another president. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=514.44s)]
*  Are Republicans still grandstanding in your view? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=515.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah, sure. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=517.44s)]
*  You have a couple that will grandstand, but I think even the grandstanders should. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=518.44s)]
*  Look, the alternative is a 68 percent tax increase. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=522.44s)]
*  And you can blame the Democrats for that and one or two grandstanders. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=525.44s)]
*  We only have one or two, but we have tremendous support. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=529.44s)]
*  But you'll have a 68 percent tax increase or you'll get a massive tax decrease. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=533.44s)]
*  You'll get a tax cut the likes of which we've never had before. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=541.44s)]
*  This is bigger than any Ronald Reagan tax cut. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=544.44s)]
*  It's even bigger than the tax cut that I gave because, as you know, that's being extended [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=547.44s)]
*  and increased. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=552.44s)]
*  So this is the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=554.44s)]
*  Or you'll get a 68 percent tax increase. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=557.44s)]
*  And if that happens, I mean, what Republican could vote for that to happen? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=561.44s)]
*  Because there wouldn't be a Republican much longer. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=565.44s)]
*  They would get, they would be knocked out so fast. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=567.44s)]
*  But we're going up to details. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=570.44s)]
*  This is a, I'm a cheerleader for this party and I'm a cheerleader for the country, much [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=571.44s)]
*  more importantly for the country. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=577.44s)]
*  But I'm a cheerleader for the party. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=579.44s)]
*  And we're going to go up and I think we're going to have a very good discussion. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=581.44s)]
*  There are one or two points that some people feel strongly about, but maybe not so soon. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=585.44s)]
*  We're going to look, we are looking at one thing. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=597.44s)]
*  We're not doing any cutting of anything meaningful. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=599.44s)]
*  The only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=602.44s)]
*  With Medicaid, waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=606.44s)]
*  There's tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=609.44s)]
*  There's incompetent things putting. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=611.44s)]
*  We have illegal aliens that are multiple killers with multiple murder records getting Medicaid. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=613.44s)]
*  I don't think anybody minds that we cut that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=619.44s)]
*  The Democrats, on the other hand, are going to destroy it because they're going to leave these people on. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=622.44s)]
*  We're cutting three things, waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=626.44s)]
*  We're not changing Medicaid and we're not changing Medicare and we're not changing Social Security. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=630.44s)]
*  And if I wanted to do those things, I would have done it during my four years that we were here. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=636.44s)]
*  Mr. President, what's your message to your fellow New Yorker Republicans who are hung up on the SALT issue? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=640.44s)]
*  Well, SALT is a very interesting thing because the governors of New York and Illinois, you know, the big J.B. who's going nowhere. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=647.44s)]
*  Probably right now he couldn't be the worst governor in the country. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=656.44s)]
*  But Illinois and Gavin Newsom, those are the people that want this. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=660.44s)]
*  And they're Democrat states. They're all Democrat states. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=667.44s)]
*  You know, Ronald Reagan tried very hard to get this passed, was unable to do it the way we have it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=670.44s)]
*  Where basically everybody's treated equally. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=677.44s)]
*  He tried it so hard and he never got it done. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=680.44s)]
*  He was always disappointed. He never got it done. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=682.44s)]
*  We got it done. Now people want to change it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=684.44s)]
*  So we're going to be talking about that. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=687.44s)]
*  But the biggest beneficiary, if we do that, are governors from New York, Illinois and California. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=689.44s)]
*  And those governors are the ones that blew it because they weren't able to get it. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=696.44s)]
*  So I think we're going to be explaining that. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=700.44s)]
*  These are all very blue states that I don't really believe. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=703.44s)]
*  We had honest elections. I don't actually believe. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=707.44s)]
*  I think I would have won California. I would have won New York. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=709.44s)]
*  I even think I would have won Illinois. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=712.44s)]
*  I think if they, we have to, you know, we're going to start this after. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=714.44s)]
*  I was talking to Mike and again, I'm his biggest fan. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=717.44s)]
*  I love this guy. He's the only guy who could have walked in with a one. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=721.44s)]
*  Think of it. You can't be a guy like me and have a one majority. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=725.44s)]
*  You have to be a guy like him, a nice person. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=729.44s)]
*  He's very religious. He prays. He's a man of God. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=732.44s)]
*  And so am I, but he's really to a new level. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=736.44s)]
*  I will tell you, he is a great guy. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=739.44s)]
*  They love him in Louisiana and they love him in, that's the only kind of guy. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=741.44s)]
*  Somebody said, Oh, well, we want somebody that if you put a certain personality in there, you would have never looked at the look at what he got passed. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=745.44s)]
*  What he's gotten past. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=752.44s)]
*  And just so you understand, he's gotten this past too. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=754.44s)]
*  And I don't think there's anybody I could give you guys that is so tough. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=757.44s)]
*  You guys would run if you ever looked at him. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=761.44s)]
*  If you ever saw some of these guys, you would not ask him questions. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=763.44s)]
*  You'd be afraid to. This guy did something that I don't think there's anybody that's more well suited to be speaker of the house, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=766.44s)]
*  especially in a case like this. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=774.44s)]
*  Remember, we had a majority of one or six months and it was a very frightening thing because the Democrats have really hurt our country. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=776.44s)]
*  And we are going to go into very much. I remember when I said the auto pay. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=786.44s)]
*  This government was illegally run for four years. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=790.44s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=793.44s)]
*  Charging member of Congress. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=795.44s)]
*  We're sure we would get comments, but we got quite a bit right there. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=797.44s)]
*  It's not a question of holdout, says the president. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=802.44s)]
*  There are some, however, within the Republican caucus that won bigger cuts in Medicaid. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=805.44s)]
*  That seems to be a sticking point. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=811.44s)]
*  Overall, it is a big bill and we'll see how beautiful it is in the end. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=813.44s)]
*  More than 1100 pages. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=817.44s)]
*  Your main provisions here are the extension of the tax cuts for individuals and businesses going back to 2017. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=819.44s)]
*  There's other requirements in here for parents and older Americans for work requirements for food assistance. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=828.44s)]
*  There's new work requirements for Medicaid. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=834.44s)]
*  There's no money for Planned Parenthood, something Republicans wanted. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=837.44s)]
*  There's this new provision for a thousand dollar savings accounts for what's called MAGA Kids, which stands for money accounts for growth and advancements. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=840.44s)]
*  There's funding for a mass deportation operation, which is a big deal. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=849.44s)]
*  And I don't think a lot of people have really dived into this enough just yet. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=854.44s)]
*  They want to hire 10,000 new ICE agents. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=859.44s)]
*  They want to finish the border wall. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=862.44s)]
*  All that money is appropriated in the bill that they're trying to negotiate and pass right now. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=864.44s)]
*  And they want a lot of spending cuts. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=868.44s)]
*  And that is why we are here at this moment, because Speaker Johnson can only lose three Republicans. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=870.44s)]
*  And right now he does not have the votes. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=877.44s)]
*  There are three holdouts and the president is hoping to change their minds this morning. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=880.44s)]
*  He's headed over to a closed door conference right now. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=885.44s)]
*  Just some color from inside the room as those Republicans are waiting for his arrival. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=888.44s)]
*  Some are texting me right now from inside that room saying that there was a lot of tension ahead of this, but there is high energy in this room. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=892.44s)]
*  A lot of electricity. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=901.44s)]
*  And another just texted me. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=902.44s)]
*  Nothing generates buzz like Trump in the Capitol. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=903.44s)]
*  So they're looking forward to hearing what he has to say. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=906.44s)]
*  Just pointing out there, Bill, he was holding on to a folder which is very unlike President Trump. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=909.44s)]
*  So perhaps he is there to get into the weeds of what the issues are and perhaps negotiates with these holdouts. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=914.44s)]
*  So let's go live now to Chad program. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=922.44s)]
*  He is just standing outside the room where the president will enter any moment now. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=924.44s)]
*  Chad, what's the latest down there? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=929.44s)]
*  Good morning, Ayesha and Bill. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=934.44s)]
*  When you talk about generating a buzz here, what he needs to generate are votes. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=935.44s)]
*  I talked to Thomas Massey, the Republican from Kentucky, who said he's an absolute no. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=940.44s)]
*  I talked a few minutes ago to Ralph Norman. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=944.44s)]
*  He is a Republican from South Carolina who eventually voted present to get that measure out of the Budget Committee on Sunday night. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=946.44s)]
*  He says, I have to go back and read through the bill. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=953.44s)]
*  I have to see potential changes that Mike Johnson is going to drop into this probably in the dead of night sometime in the next 24 hours. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=956.44s)]
*  He said that takes some time to process. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=963.44s)]
*  So this is far from a done deal. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=965.44s)]
*  This is probably the highest stakes poker that President Trump has played on domestic policy during his second term because he has to get this bill through. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=968.44s)]
*  He talks about the art of the deal. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=977.44s)]
*  He needs to get the votes. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=979.44s)]
*  And as I always say, it's about the math. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=981.44s)]
*  If they were to put this bill on the floor right now, it would not pass. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=983.44s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, we might get a few comments here from the president as he walks by being escorted by Bill McFarland, the sergeant at arms. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=988.44s)]
*  Let's listen for a second. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=995.44s)]
*  And he kept it together and we actually passed this. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1017.44s)]
*  Nobody else did it. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1021.44s)]
*  He's done a fantastic job. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1022.44s)]
*  We have a very, very unified party. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1024.44s)]
*  Remember, we had one and now we have seven. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1027.44s)]
*  We won elections. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1029.44s)]
*  We won elections. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1030.44s)]
*  And we don't win a lot of elections. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1031.44s)]
*  The economy is good. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1033.44s)]
*  I just had my highest poll numbers ever. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1034.44s)]
*  Ever. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1037.44s)]
*  And we had a big trip to the Middle East. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1038.44s)]
*  We took in five point one trillion dollars. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1040.44s)]
*  We brought it back to our country. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1042.44s)]
*  One hundred and eighty Boeing aircraft were being built now because of that trip and many other things. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1044.44s)]
*  That's the least of it. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1049.44s)]
*  The economy is doing great. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1051.44s)]
*  The stock market is higher now than when I came to office. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1053.44s)]
*  And we've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff money. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1055.44s)]
*  And we've had no inflation. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1059.44s)]
*  You know, they kept saying inflation. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1060.44s)]
*  There's no inflation. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1062.44s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1064.44s)]
*  Gasoline is way down. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1066.44s)]
*  Way down. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1068.44s)]
*  Everything is down. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1069.44s)]
*  All energy costs are down. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1070.44s)]
*  The con...I'll tell you, to me, maybe the most respected thing. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1072.44s)]
*  You saw the way they respected me between Qatar and Saudi Arabia and UAE. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1076.44s)]
*  Probably the richest, certainly the richest of their type nation. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1081.44s)]
*  Great place. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1085.44s)]
*  Unbelievable amounts of money. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1086.44s)]
*  They respect our country again. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1088.44s)]
*  They were going to go to China. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1090.44s)]
*  China was going to take over those countries. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1091.44s)]
*  One hundred percent they were dealing with China because they weren't treated right by the last administration. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1093.44s)]
*  And they have tremendous economic power. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1098.44s)]
*  They have more money than anybody. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1100.44s)]
*  We probably have more money, but we have other things. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1102.44s)]
*  They're very, very...they're very cash rich, to put it mildly. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1105.44s)]
*  And they're spending 5.1 trillion, probably it's going to be 7 trillion by the time we sell. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1110.44s)]
*  And, you know, somebody said every other president goes and leaves and spends money, gives other countries money. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1116.44s)]
*  I'm the only one that goes and takes money back. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1122.44s)]
*  You know, when you think of it, I said, that's an interesting statement. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1126.44s)]
*  I never thought of it that way. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1129.44s)]
*  But we have a...this is really just a pep talk. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1131.44s)]
*  We have a very unified House and we have a very unified Senate. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1134.44s)]
*  And Mike is doing a phenomenal job as Speaker. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1139.44s)]
*  He's going to be there a long time. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1142.44s)]
*  And we have a man in the Senate, our leader Thun. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1143.44s)]
*  Mr. Thun is doing a great job. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1148.44s)]
*  I've gotten to like him a lot and he's doing a fantastic job. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1150.44s)]
*  Between the two guys, very different personalities actually in certain ways, but they are doing a fantastic job. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1153.44s)]
*  I don't think the Republican Party has ever been so unified. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1162.44s)]
*  It's become a much bigger party. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1166.44s)]
*  You know, we're winning the labor vote. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1167.44s)]
*  We're winning...we won the Teamsters. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1169.44s)]
*  We won votes at no...look how well we did with the automakers. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1171.44s)]
*  And by the way, the president of the automakers is now my biggest fan. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1174.44s)]
*  He said, you take tariffs. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1179.44s)]
*  You don't have any auto plants that are being built now in this country because of the tariffs? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1181.44s)]
*  Three just announced yesterday that they're building...there's a revolution going on. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1185.44s)]
*  A positive one in our country and I love it. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1191.44s)]
*  And we're doing really well. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1194.44s)]
*  And we're also talking negotiations to stop the president. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1196.44s)]
*  We want the negotiations to be over now. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1199.44s)]
*  Which negotiation? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1201.44s)]
*  Over this bill. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1202.44s)]
*  Oh yeah, well it's going to be. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1203.44s)]
*  We're going to be putting it in soon and I think we're going to have great support. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1204.44s)]
*  We're going to make a couple of tweaks. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1208.44s)]
*  I mean, we don't want to benefit Democrat governors. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1210.44s)]
*  Although I would do that if it made it better, but they don't know what they're doing. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1214.44s)]
*  We don't want to do any damage to a state. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1217.44s)]
*  We want to help all the states. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1222.44s)]
*  But we have governors that are from the Democrat Party. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1224.44s)]
*  Let's say New York, Illinois, big ones. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1227.44s)]
*  And let's say Gavin Newsom, who's done a horrible job in California. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1230.44s)]
*  We want to benefit the... [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1234.44s)]
*  We want to benefit Republicans because they are the ones that are going to make America great again. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1236.44s)]
*  The Democrats are destroying our country. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1241.44s)]
*  And you see that with the passing administration, with an open borders policy that allowed 21 million people into our country. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1243.44s)]
*  And many of those people are stone cold murderous killers and trouble. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1250.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1255.44s)]
*  I have a fiscal hock that we want to build. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1256.44s)]
*  Say it. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1259.44s)]
*  What are you planning to tell the fiscal hocks that you want to build? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1260.44s)]
*  I'm a fiscal hock. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1262.44s)]
*  They don't think there's enough spending. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1263.44s)]
*  I'm a bigger fiscal hock. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1265.44s)]
*  There's nobody like me as a fiscal hock. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1266.44s)]
*  Thomas Massey said it's added more deficit than Biden did, and this is this bill kind of thing. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1268.44s)]
*  Because we have to fix the country. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1272.44s)]
*  Do you think that Thomas Massey is correct in saying that this is adding Biden-level spending? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1273.44s)]
*  No, I don't think Thomas Massey understands government. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1277.44s)]
*  I think he's a grandstander, frankly. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1280.44s)]
*  He'll probably vote. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1283.44s)]
*  We don't even talk to him much. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1284.44s)]
*  I think he should be voted out of office. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1285.44s)]
*  And I just don't think he understands government. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1287.44s)]
*  If you ask him a couple of questions, he never gives you an answer. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1289.44s)]
*  He just says, I'm a no. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1292.44s)]
*  He thinks he's going to get publicity. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1293.44s)]
*  And you have that. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1295.44s)]
*  You have that. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1296.44s)]
*  They've got some, too. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1297.44s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1298.44s)]
*  Mr. President, on Medicaid, do you want work requirements based in next year? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1299.44s)]
*  Do you think that's possible? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1302.44s)]
*  Here's what I want on Medicaid. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1303.44s)]
*  We're not touching anything. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1305.44s)]
*  All I want is one thing. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1306.44s)]
*  Three words. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1308.44s)]
*  We don't want any waste, fraud, or abuse. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1309.44s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1311.44s)]
*  Waste, fraud, abuse. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1312.44s)]
*  Other than that, we're leaving it. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1314.44s)]
*  Medicare, we're leaving it. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1316.44s)]
*  All we're after, and this is for the good of it, is a lot of waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1318.44s)]
*  That's all we're doing. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1323.44s)]
*  We're not touching it. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1324.44s)]
*  The Democrats are going to destroy it. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1325.44s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1327.44s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think you'll be able to convince Chip Roy and Ralph Norman to vote [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1328.44s)]
*  for this bill? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1332.44s)]
*  We're not touching Medicaid. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1333.44s)]
*  We are conservative businessmen who want to go murder. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1335.44s)]
*  Waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1338.44s)]
*  That's all the cuts we're doing. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1340.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TkzvQ4z0tg&t=1341.44s)]
