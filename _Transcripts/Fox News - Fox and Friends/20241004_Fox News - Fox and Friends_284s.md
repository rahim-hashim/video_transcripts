# UFC star: Young men will turn out for Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ)
*  Meanwhile, 15 minutes now after the hour, a bit of a surprise, but it shouldn't have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=0.0s)]
*  been. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  If you ever go to a UFC event, you could see the groundswell of support of like-minded [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=4.8s)]
*  people that seem to be supporting Donald Trump, especially Jorge Masfidel, who I think has [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=8.32s)]
*  a book out now, too, talking about his remarkable journey to success in the octagon. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=13.88s)]
*  And he was, I guess, doing an interview, and I think people were surprised by his explanation [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=20.52s)]
*  about who he supports. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=25.8s)]
*  This is what he said. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=26.8s)]
*  Do you think that there is something about the way they talk about issues that for other [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=29.52s)]
*  young men who are in the place you were, that is going to make them actually turn out? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=35.72s)]
*  100%. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=43.6s)]
*  What's different this year? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=45.6s)]
*  What's different this year is that hardworking men like myself, you know, there's a lot of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=47.64s)]
*  us, there's a lot of men that are just, we're wired for that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=53.0s)]
*  We're going to wake up early and we're going to get to work. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=55.4s)]
*  We're going to find a job. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=58.4s)]
*  We're going to provide for our families, for our families back home. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=59.4s)]
*  Whatever it is, we're going to provide for them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=63.32s)]
*  And now we have this, you know, we're going to work 12-hour, 14-hour shifts every day. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=65.12s)]
*  You know, and then at the end of the week, we're going to count up, see how much money [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=69.96s)]
*  I got. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=72.08s)]
*  It doesn't take a rocket scientist. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=73.08s)]
*  These same hardworking dogs are going to be like, no matter how many hours I put in now, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=74.92s)]
*  I'm still coming up considerably short. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=79.28s)]
*  You know, Ainsley, this is not shocking to me. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=82.4s)]
*  And I hear when I go to barbershops across the country, there's two issues that my generation [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=85.08s)]
*  as well as men at large are talking about. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  It's the economy because we want to be able to provide for our families. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  Not all men are dead beasts. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  We want to take care of our children. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=96.92s)]
*  We want to take care of our family. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=98.12s)]
*  And the next issue is what's happening in schools. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=100.10000000000001s)]
*  They don't like all this, you know, wokeness that's being taught. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=102.68s)]
*  A lot of the stuff, they're going to love their children no matter what, but they want [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=106.76s)]
*  to be able to make their decisions with their family. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  They don't like what's being taught in the classroom. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=111.44s)]
*  I'm interested to know is what us young people are talking about as young men are talking [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=113.44s)]
*  about, are you hearing that from women as well? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=117.64s)]
*  Well, you know, I've asked you, is it do you believe the stats? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=119.6s)]
*  Do you think more black men are supporting Donald Trump? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=122.76s)]
*  And you say yes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=125.48s)]
*  And when we were talking about this clip, you brought up a good point. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=126.88s)]
*  Men want to provide for their families. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=129.98s)]
*  And that's just that's innate. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=131.76s)]
*  That's how that's how you are. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=133.4s)]
*  That's how God created you to be. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=135.16s)]
*  That's what my dad did. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=136.82s)]
*  That's what you do for your family. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=137.88s)]
*  That's what you will do for you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=139.2s)]
*  You already do a lot for your family. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=140.44s)]
*  When you have a wife one day and I'm a traditionalist, I think that's important. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  I like a man to work hard. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=146.28s)]
*  I grew up in a household where that happened. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=147.68s)]
*  So I agree with him. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=149.32s)]
*  I understand that men do want to provide for their families and and not, you know, take [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=150.92s)]
*  money, have to take money from the government unless it's, you know, unless it's essential. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  So you as a government, as a president, you can't give people a raise, but you can make [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=159.76s)]
*  sure the best you can to keep inflation down so people can afford what they're buying. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  So if you make if you're saying to yourself, I'll get another job and another job and another [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=167.92s)]
*  job, but the prices go up, the taxes are high, you're taking home less and you and you have [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=171.39999999999998s)]
*  to have more to go spend. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  He is a working class guy who has a remarkable biography. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=177.76s)]
*  He was one of these guys who took the microphone, saw Donald Trump in the cell in the audience [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=181.92s)]
*  and said, I'm going to support you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=186.88s)]
*  You have my back. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=188.44s)]
*  And he shook his hand. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=189.44s)]
*  I think the video is available maybe next hour. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=190.6s)]
*  But he wrote a book. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think that people are surprised when they're talking to him that he supports Donald [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  Trump and they're trying to intimidate him into not. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=197.96s)]
*  And he's like, are you kidding me? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=202.16s)]
*  I think they're so enclosed in their echo chamber that they don't realize there's there's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=203.16s)]
*  mass support from different groups of people. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=206.72s)]
*  And I think the second issue that they're undermining, that they're not really paying [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=210.0s)]
*  attention is the amount of funds that they're giving to legals coming across the border [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=213.72s)]
*  for people that work hard and pay taxes and try to provide for the family. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  They're struggling. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=222.24s)]
*  You got a whole relief disaster in North Carolina and Georgia with a slow of resources and they [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=224.24s)]
*  don't have the resources right now, but we're passing it out on debit cards and housing [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  to legals in the country. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=236.96s)]
*  That ticks people off. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=237.96s)]
*  We're hearing FEMA's running out of money that we can't afford another hurricane this [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=238.96s)]
*  hurricane season, yet we're giving millions and millions and millions to legal immigrants. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=241.8s)]
*  What's this clown doing? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=246.12s)]
*  I'm head of Homeland Security Secretary in the middle of hurricane season. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=247.12s)]
*  And by the way, I'm out of money. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=249.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=251.16000000000003s)]
*  I think that should have been the link. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=252.16000000000003s)]
*  You're out of money. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  You let Congress go home. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  We just gave you $20 million. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=256.08s)]
*  Remember Speaker Johnson said we just gave them $20 million because they thought it would [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=257.08s)]
*  be a good thing to do? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=260.4s)]
*  Then he sits there just because, yeah, I don't have the money. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=261.4s)]
*  Yeah, but under FEMA, under Homeland Security. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=264.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=266.44s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=267.44s)]
*  So they have about $220 billion, but that might be their budget. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=268.44s)]
*  But they just added $20 million. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k20abApfQQ&t=272.0s)]
