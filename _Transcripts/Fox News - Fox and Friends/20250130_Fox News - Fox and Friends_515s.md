# Plane crash a ‘shock to the system’ in DC amid frantic search and rescue efforts
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8)
*  Let's bring in John Roberts now. He's on the scene getting set to host America [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=0.0s)]
*  reports, but helping us out this morning. He knows the area, knows the routine, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=4.48s)]
*  knows aviation. Uh, so, so John, there are some reports that they even [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  overnight they're able to, they were pulling out some bodies. Have you been [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=13.0s)]
*  able to confirm anything like that? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=16.72s)]
*  I we have not heard reports from police where where I am yet. I mean, that's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=20.12s)]
*  probably what the situation is. The emergency services launching to action [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=24.36s)]
*  so quickly when something like this happens. Remember a week ago, a little [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  more than a week ago, there was a car accident on the Arlington Memorial [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  Bridge. Pickup truck went off the bridge and into the Potomac River and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=36.68s)]
*  divers were on the scene within a number of minutes. So when something [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=40.48s)]
*  like this happens, they're always prepared for the worst and to respond [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=43.28s)]
*  to it. There are so many police agencies around here. The Coast Guard is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  just a little bit up the way. We see the Coast Guard helicopters flying here [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=51.16s)]
*  all the time. So they are well equipped to respond to an emergency like this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=54.919999999999995s)]
*  But it's just it's still such a shock to the system here in Washington D. C. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=59.64s)]
*  that something like this happens. It was it was back in 1982, the last time [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=64.0s)]
*  that a plane went down in the Potomac River. You'll remember the air [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=68.72s)]
*  florida flight and so much going on today in D. C. As well with confirmation [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=71.96s)]
*  hearings for the FBI director nominee cash Patel Tulsi Gabbard as well for [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=76.16s)]
*  O. D. And I those hearings, as we understand, are going to go ahead today [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  because as Tom Cotton was saying, Sean Duffy was saying, it really drives home [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=86.44s)]
*  the importance of the president's having the president having his national [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=91.48s)]
*  security team and all of his support staff and advisors in place. Because [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=95.16s)]
*  when we've got to respond to something like this, you want to make sure that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  you've got your team in place. Now, as for how this happened, you heard Lucas [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=104.12s)]
*  Tomlinson talking about it a little bit earlier. These planes come in [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  and out of Reagan all day. They do share airspace, very crowded airspace with a [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=111.48s)]
*  lot of official helicopters. Well, as well, whether they be army park police [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=116.28s)]
*  helicopter came over us just a little while ago. Again, the Coast Guard is [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=120.24s)]
*  flying here. We always see the president's Marine one helicopters [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=123.4s)]
*  training out of joint baseballing. It is very, very crowded airspace. Clearly [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=128.64s)]
*  there's no civilian aircraft that are flying in the area because of severe [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=132.88s)]
*  flight restrictions. But you do get a lot of official aircraft and commercial [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=137.12s)]
*  aircraft coming in and out of here. And every time you fly in, because [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  particularly if you come from the north with that meandering river route for [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=145.48s)]
*  security and noise abatement reasons, you wonder is something going to go [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=149.04s)]
*  wrong? Could something go wrong here? Because it is a very tenuous approach [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=153.2s)]
*  from the south. It's a lot easier. But but no, I mean, whoever would have [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=156.72s)]
*  thought that there would be a collision between two aircraft because it's just [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  so tightly regulated here, Brian, that that something like this. So I've never [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  known anything like this to happen in this area. So for it to happen here is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=170.16s)]
*  really a shock. So John, who takes the lead here? Okay, so obviously you got a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=173.4s)]
*  commercial aircraft, so you got the FAA involved with that. But you also have a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=177.56s)]
*  military aircraft with that black hawk helicopter. So that's D. O. D. Who's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=181.6s)]
*  going to lead this investigation in this case? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=186.68s)]
*  Well, typically in any kind of incident involving an aircraft, it's the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=190.84s)]
*  National Transportation Safety Board that takes the lead. But the fact that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=194.12s)]
*  there is a military aircraft that's involved here probably would involve the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  Pentagon as well. We'll probably hear from the Secretary of Defense Pete [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=201.6s)]
*  Hegseth at some point today about how this investigation is going to proceed. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=207.16s)]
*  But right now, search and rescue is the order of the day. And you have got [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=211.11999999999998s)]
*  literally every agency out here that's got assets in the water, in the air as [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=216.16s)]
*  well, trying to see if there could possibly be some survivors. But as Lucas [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=222.56s)]
*  was saying, the water here, while the ice went out just in the last couple of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=226.8s)]
*  days because of warmer temperatures, the water is still very, very cold. So for [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=231.36s)]
*  anybody to be in there for longer than a few minutes probably has a very low [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  chance of survival. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=239.52s)]
*  Indeed. John, stand by. We are just now getting a statement from the federal [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=240.56s)]
*  government. This is from Ron McClendon, Deputy Director over at the Pentagon. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=244.36s)]
*  And the quote goes like this. While performing a training mission, a United [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  States Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter from Bravo Company, 12th Aviation [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=255.92s)]
*  Battalion, Davidson Army Airfield, Fort Belvoir, collided in midair with an [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=261.04s)]
*  American Airlines Bombardier CRJ 700 regional jet flight 5342 last night at [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=266.76s)]
*  Ronald Reagan Washington Airport. The FAA, NTSB and the U.S. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=274.44s)]
*  Army will investigate. The NTSB will lead the investigation. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=279.6s)]
*  That answers your question right there, Lawrence. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  We are working with local officials and will provide any additional information [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=285.8s)]
*  once it becomes available. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=290.48s)]
*  John, as somebody who has been on that river a lot, we're looking at some of the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=292.48s)]
*  small boats that are patrolling the area looking for stuff. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=297.24s)]
*  And right in the middle, it looks like debris. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=300.88000000000005s)]
*  We see a couple of different patches of stuff that looks like it could actually [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=304.52000000000004s)]
*  be part of the plane or part of the chopper. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=309.64000000000004s)]
*  How deep is the water there? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=313.08s)]
*  Well, here's what I can tell you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=316.52s)]
*  That there's a big sort of alluvial fan area that comes off of the eastern side [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=317.76s)]
*  of the airport and the water there is anywhere between three and 12 feet deep. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=324.68s)]
*  There's a ship channel on the far eastern side that's 31 feet deep, but it's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=330.0s)]
*  very, very shallow water in there and it's very muddy as well. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=333.88s)]
*  And as we saw when when value jet went down in the Florida Everglades, most of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=337.8s)]
*  the plane went into the mud in the Everglades and it was very, very difficult [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=342.76s)]
*  to find any piece of the aircraft. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=347.44s)]
*  Anything that came down hard and this this plane was three or four hundred feet [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=349.6s)]
*  in the air, so it would have come down hard, may have gone actually through the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=353.72s)]
*  shallow water and into the mud and is stuck there. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=357.04s)]
*  So I can't say whether that's debris from the aircraft. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=360.44s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff that floats down this river, particularly as the ice [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  breaks up, you know, there are logs and and leaves and other detritus that are [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=367.52s)]
*  floating by all the time. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=372.68s)]
*  This does look like something that's more of a structural aspect to it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=373.8s)]
*  And could that be a part of the plane? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=379.44s)]
*  Could that be a part of the helicopter? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=380.92s)]
*  Can't tell from this far out, but it's likely that there's obviously going to be [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=383.08s)]
*  a lot of debris in the water, particularly with the water being shallow. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=388.0s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if if the plane is just below the surface. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=391.52s)]
*  Yeah, John, when it comes to the recovery efforts last night when I was going to bed, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=394.64s)]
*  I wanted to know how many survivors are there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=399.28s)]
*  And I had that same question this morning. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=401.52s)]
*  We really don't have any answers at seven thirty. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=403.68s)]
*  We're going to find out more with this press conference. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=406.32s)]
*  But what is that water like? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=409.08s)]
*  Because if this were the ocean, you have the currents that you have to worry about. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=410.64s)]
*  As far as recovery efforts are concerned and trying to find passengers in the water, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  I know it's really cold. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=420.04s)]
*  It's 35 degrees that water. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=421.32s)]
*  What are the currents like? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  Are they having to deal with that? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=425.6s)]
*  Would they be easier to find bodies in in this water? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, it's very murky water. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=433.24s)]
*  This this time of year, it tends to be a little bit clearer because there's not as [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=435.48s)]
*  much organic material in the water as there is during the summer where the algae [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=438.56s)]
*  really gets going. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  So the water is probably a little bit clearer than it is in the summertime, but [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=443.56s)]
*  it's still very murky, particularly in this area where there's so much mud in the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=446.84000000000003s)]
*  bottom of it. In terms of the current, the current really varies here on the Potomac [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=451.88s)]
*  River. Sometimes you get a half decent flow with the water coming down from the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=456.44s)]
*  the upper part of Maryland. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=462.52s)]
*  But don't forget, it's also it's a little bit it's a tidal area as well because the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=465.12s)]
*  tide start to come up the Chesapeake. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=469.2s)]
*  It slows down the flow, at least on the surface. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=471.04s)]
*  So sometimes you get a pretty good flow down to the south into the Chesapeake. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=474.24s)]
*  And then other times there's hardly a flow at all. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=477.24s)]
*  I remember being out of my boat a couple of summers ago. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=480.16s)]
*  We were up the Potomac just north of Georgetown University and we were basically [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=484.04s)]
*  just sitting there in the middle of a river without having to throw out an anchor [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=488.44s)]
*  because of the way that the flow is coming back up in the river, counted the flow [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=492.56s)]
*  coming down from from the north and nothing was moving at all. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=495.56s)]
*  So, you know, there hasn't been a lot of current here. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=499.92s)]
*  It has cleared out the ice some and we'll see things floating by. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=503.36s)]
*  But the current is very slow. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=506.68s)]
*  So anything that's in the river probably would be moving very slowly. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=507.92s)]
*  All right, John Roberts, we appreciate it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w2JLGeCcJ8&t=512.36s)]
