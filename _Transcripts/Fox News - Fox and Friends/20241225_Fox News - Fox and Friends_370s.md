# Rabbi shares moving story of a menorah that escaped the Holocaust
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac)
*  For the first time in almost 20 years Hanukkah and Christmas will be celebrated on the same day [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=0.0s)]
*  Bringing interfaith families together while highlighting America's religious heritage [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=5.88s)]
*  Theologian Jonathan Morris and Rabbi Chaim Steinmetz join us now with their message. Good morning to you both. Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=10.6s)]
*  I love saying both of them in the same sentence [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=18.34s)]
*  And you know seeing you together reminds me of the great and beautiful unity between [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=20.52s)]
*  Christians and Jews so rabbi with that in mind. What is your message for us this morning? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=26.1s)]
*  The message is really very very simple, which is one that embraces everyone which is it is important to have hope [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=30.1s)]
*  It is important to have resilience [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=37.16s)]
*  Really the lesson of the Hanukkah candle which was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=40.04s)]
*  Encapsulated by a great rabbi the Baal Shem Tov is that a little bit of light [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=44.24s)]
*  Pushes away an enormous amount of darkness and that's the message of Hanukkah [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=49.7s)]
*  That a small group can overcome the odds against them and fight for their religion [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=55.34s)]
*  That just one jar of oil can last for eight days when it's supposed to last for one [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=60.78s)]
*  You should never lose hope and isn't it interesting father that that's the message of Christmas, too [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=67.94s)]
*  It is the book of Galatians [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=75.28s)]
*  Talks about in the fullness of time God sent his son and the fullness of time [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=77.92s)]
*  Means when the right time had come and it's interesting the way in which the right time according to God [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=83.56s)]
*  Seems to be prepared for by human action [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=90.28s)]
*  In other words when we do our part it gets ready for God's grace to enter into our lives [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=93.44s)]
*  And that's the story of Christmas in the fullness of time God sent his son in the form of a baby according to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=98.84s)]
*  belief in the form of a baby [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=105.0s)]
*  You know someone that we can accept and love no matter our weakness and no matter our difficulties [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=107.76s)]
*  Who cannot hug and kiss a baby? Yes. In fact, I have some cookies that my three-year-old made for you [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=114.38s)]
*  He washes his hands every once in a while [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=121.0s)]
*  I'll leave them here, but children are so [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=124.28s)]
*  Yeah, we find God in them the most innocent form of humanity placed on earth to save us all [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=127.88s)]
*  And rabbi you brought a very special menorah onto the set with you this morning [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=133.78s)]
*  And I'd love for you to share the story [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=140.38s)]
*  so so this actually belongs to my colleague Rachel Krauss and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=142.38s)]
*  It was given to her by her late grandfather Walter Krug now [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=146.92s)]
*  Walter grew up in Frankfurt, Germany and as a teen in 1938 was actually interred in a Nazi labor camp [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=152.26s)]
*  He managed to escape [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=160.89999999999998s)]
*  Comes back to his mother. His mother says you better get out of here. They're going to be searching for you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=163.02s)]
*  He goes to Poland goes all the way across the Soviet Union [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  Comes to Shanghai someone there says why don't you join the Flying Tigers? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=173.18s)]
*  And he ultimately begins flying through the American Air Force [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=177.9s)]
*  1945 he goes back to Frankfurt and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=183.38s)]
*  Actually [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=186.94s)]
*  The family heirlooms had been hidden by a neighbor a woman named Lydia who wasn't Jewish and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=188.46s)]
*  It was Lydia who watched over them and as as many people have pointed out. This was a great [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  Great danger to herself and it shows you how people can come together [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=202.38s)]
*  despite being parts of different faiths and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=207.3s)]
*  So he comes his mother unfortunately is gone his mother had been murdered by the Nazis [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=210.18s)]
*  But he comes he takes this menorah [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=216.56s)]
*  moves to the United States and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=219.16s)]
*  Four generations of family have been lighting this menorah [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=221.72s)]
*  I mean, I just love that story so much that a woman of non-jewish face risked her life to hide that menorah from [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=226.04s)]
*  Nazi German officials and it also speaks to you being on the same stage together [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=234.68s)]
*  You know people of all different faiths coming together because it's just the right thing to do and in that story [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=241.6s)]
*  I'm also reminded Jonathan of st. Maximilian [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=247.82s)]
*  it's one of the saints that is featured on on the Fox Nation show Saints because he was a Polish priest who [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=251.08s)]
*  Gave up his life for in place of a Jewish man [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=257.4s)]
*  He died at Auschwitz because the man had children. So he said take me instead of him. Yeah in the end [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=261.48s)]
*  There's one God as the Jewish belief in Christian faith [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=268.88s)]
*  Of all of us and what we're on this earth [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=274.48s)]
*  We might call ourselves one thing or another but in the end we are children of God and that's the way he sees us [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=277.2s)]
*  I believe and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=284.28s)]
*  Christmas and Hanukkah being celebrated together. What a great reminder to us. I don't is it just me. I feel very hopeful right now [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  It's not only that I mean there's this powerful connection [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=293.92s)]
*  Between Christians and Jews which we neglected for so long [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=297.24s)]
*  We really neglected for far too long and there's a recognition we share our Tanakh is shared as Christian scripture [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=301.36s)]
*  And when we talk about the story of Christmas, I mean you're you know [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=309.06s)]
*  You're using Jesus and Joseph and Mary and I'm in my mind thinking the Hebrew names [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=313.7s)]
*  Yehoshua and Yosef and Miriam [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  Because there is this incredible connection [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=321.84s)]
*  Jesus was a Jew and Jesus was born in the Jewish homeland [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=324.68s)]
*  That's right [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=329.48s)]
*  And that there that's this enormous connection of history that we have with each other that we're finally rediscovering right now in America [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=329.88s)]
*  Yes, that's a wonderful connection and a bond that can ever be broken [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=338.2s)]
*  Jonathan Merry Christmas [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=343.04s)]
*  Rabbi happy Hanukkah. Thank you for bringing that special menorah in the story with you [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=345.04s)]
*  We love you both and thank you for the cookies. Oh, that was [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=348.82s)]
*  My son Andy and Timmy who are up waiting for me to get back to open their gifts and it's talented Baker [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPf9WxoRQac&t=351.68s)]
