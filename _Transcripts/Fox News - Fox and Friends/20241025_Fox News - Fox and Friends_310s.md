# 'Fox & Friends': Hillary Clinton ripped for channeling 'old playbook'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM)
*  Yeah, so Hillary was on another network yesterday, and you know, she said the basket of deplorables. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=0.0s)]
*  A lot of Republicans did not like that, the smelly Walmart shoppers, then they embraced [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=7.96s)]
*  it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=11.92s)]
*  And now she is saying, this is such a stretch. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=12.92s)]
*  Keep in mind, she has a book out right now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=15.16s)]
*  She wants you to buy it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=16.94s)]
*  She's probably opening up the book and saying, what can I talk about in this interview from [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=17.94s)]
*  my book so I can plug my book, which is exactly what she did. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=23.64s)]
*  So Donald Trump is going to MSG this week and he has a big rally at Madison Square Garden. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=27.12s)]
*  And now she's saying because of that, it's emblematic of this Nazi rally that took place [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=32.0s)]
*  in 1939. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=36.44s)]
*  In New York. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=37.44s)]
*  Listen to this, in New York, right. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=38.44s)]
*  One other thing that you'll see next week, Caitlin, is Trump actually reenacting the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=41.72s)]
*  Madison Square Garden rally in 1939. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=50.88s)]
*  I write about this in my book. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=55.0s)]
*  President Franklin Roosevelt was appalled that neo-Nazis, fascists in America were lining [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=57.72s)]
*  up to essentially pledge their support for the kind of government that they were seeing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=65.2s)]
*  in Germany. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=72.56s)]
*  So I don't think we can ignore it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=74.08s)]
*  Now, it may be a leap for some people and a lot of others may think, I don't want to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=76.4s)]
*  go there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=81.16s)]
*  I don't want to say that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=82.16s)]
*  But please open your eyes to the danger that this man poses to our country because I think [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=83.58000000000001s)]
*  it is clear and present for anybody paying attention. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=90.9s)]
*  She has no responsibility for her loss in 2016. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  She then blames James Comey. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=98.5s)]
*  Doesn't blame the fact that she took home emails and then her assistant took it to Anthony [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=99.82000000000001s)]
*  Weiner's laptop and Comey had no choice but to go public and say, I have to reopen this [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=103.62s)]
*  investigation into how more classified emails ended up in New York City. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=107.94s)]
*  It was the perfect storm. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=113.89999999999999s)]
*  But she never takes any responsibility. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=115.58s)]
*  She blamed the Russians, called Donald Trump an illegitimate president. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=117.1s)]
*  But if she does it now, it's a problem because you've been criticizing President Trump for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=120.38s)]
*  saying that election was illegitimate. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=124.28s)]
*  Now we don't want to go back and have Hillary Clinton say it, so she's just attacking. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=127.18s)]
*  But James Carville said it first, saying President Trump's choice to go to Madison Square Garden [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=131.66s)]
*  reminds him of the 1939 Nazi rally. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=136.29999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=139.29999999999998s)]
*  Anyone who performs at Madison Square Garden, are they going to remind us of a reenactment? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=140.29999999999998s)]
*  No, what they're going to say- [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=143.82s)]
*  And there was no candidate there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=144.82s)]
*  They're going to, on Sunday night here, it's sold out, there's going to be a sea of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=145.82s)]
*  MAGA hats. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=150.17999999999998s)]
*  And we've heard over the last number of years, you know, the MAGA hat is a symbol of racism, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=151.17999999999998s)]
*  anything bad, people have said that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=156.94s)]
*  So they're linking what John Kelly said about Trump being a fascist with that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=158.73999999999998s)]
*  And it all details perfectly into their final argument. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=164.38s)]
*  Oh, John Kelly said this and now Hillary's talking about that Nazi rally. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=168.1s)]
*  But here's also the problem. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=172.01999999999998s)]
*  I know the point was to attack Donald Trump, but are you saying the people that decided [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=173.01999999999998s)]
*  to get a ticket, that sold out in three hours, that all these people that are lining up in [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=177.34s)]
*  New York City, now I'm not from here, I'm from Texas. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=182.66s)]
*  So are you saying that all these, the people that elected you Hillary Clinton to be a senator [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=184.92s)]
*  all of these people that are going to Madison Square Garden supports a Nazi? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=190.84s)]
*  I mean, that's what they're losing right here, is they're not talking about the issues, they're [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=196.0s)]
*  not talking about people's paychecks, they're not talking about grocery store price, they [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=200.72s)]
*  just want to demonize half of the country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=204.0s)]
*  Fifty percent of the country, you're right. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=207.96s)]
*  But you're demonizing New Yorkers. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=208.96s)]
*  Okay, these are your people. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=210.68s)]
*  These are normal Democrats. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=212.88s)]
*  And remember when you said at the beginning of the show, you said this is the playbook, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=214.32s)]
*  this is what they've been doing for 60 years. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=218.1s)]
*  There's an article out now talking about this, that how they're known for playing the Nazi [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=219.98s)]
*  card. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=224.38s)]
*  They did it with Goldwater, they did it with Nixon, they did it with Gerald Ford, they [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=225.38s)]
*  did it with Ronald Reagan. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  This article. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=231.26s)]
*  They did it with Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=232.26s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=233.26s)]
*  Recently. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=234.26s)]
*  Yeah, so Hillary Clinton also said in that interview, she said there's just too much [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=235.26s)]
*  evidence about what he wants to do. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  What about the evidence of what she wants to do? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=240.66s)]
*  What she's done at our border? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=242.76s)]
*  What she's done when it comes to crime? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=244.54s)]
*  What she's done at the grocery stores? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  She and Joe Biden, the prices are through the roof now. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  And that is what matters, Ainsley. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=251.14s)]
*  But this is an attempt to shame voters, to say that you cannot vote for Donald Trump, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=252.89999999999998s)]
*  that you can't vote on the issues that matter to you because it's embarrassing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=257.5s)]
*  You would be supporting the second coming of Hitler. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=261.9s)]
*  I think voters are going to reject that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=264.38s)]
*  We lived through four years with him. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=266.06s)]
*  He was not a Hitler. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=267.58s)]
*  Ultimately, I think it drives them crazy to know that in the heart of the bluest big city [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=268.58s)]
*  in America, there are 20,000 people standing up wearing MAGA hats loving Donald Trump. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=274.42s)]
*  Well, and that's what the policy name was. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=280.42s)]
*  It was 16,000 and there was 5,000 on the outside. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=281.42s)]
*  Republicans in New York are probably relieved that they can finally have a safe space to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=284.38s)]
*  wear some of those hats. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=288.18s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=289.3s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what, I think that the MAGA hat is not nearly as a lightning rod [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=290.3s)]
*  as it has been. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=294.3s)]
*  I see it way more now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=295.3s)]
*  I watch people around or walking around in hats. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=296.3s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=299.3s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEG0AaOZKuM&t=300.3s)]
