# 'Unexpected development': Israel raids Gaza hospital, targets Hamas leaders
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8)
*  Fox News alert right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli defense forces say they arrested dozens of terrorists during an overnight raid at [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=2.88s)]
*  Shefa Hospital over in Gaza. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=8.0s)]
*  Trey Yanks is in Israel with more. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=10.76s)]
*  Trey. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=12.8s)]
*  Yeah, hey, Brian. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=13.8s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  An unexpected development overnight as Israeli forces once again enter Gaza's largest hospital, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=16.28s)]
*  the Al-Shifa complex in the heart of Gaza City. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=22.2s)]
*  You can see in this drone video here, firefights erupting as Israeli forces enter the complex. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=25.16s)]
*  The compound now rear Admiral Daniel Higari, the top spokesman for the Israeli military, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=29.96s)]
*  said Israel is acting on intelligence that senior Hamas militants are sheltering in the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=34.88s)]
*  hospital. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=39.68s)]
*  He said this overnight. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=40.68s)]
*  We call upon all Hamas terrorists hiding in hospital. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=42.84s)]
*  Surrender immediately. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=48.24s)]
*  Medical facilities should never be exploited for terror. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Our understanding is that Israeli soldiers are still operating in Shefa at this hour. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=54.92s)]
*  Hamas did release a statement condemning the incursion and the Israelis releasing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=59.76s)]
*  a new statement this hour saying they took out the internal security operator for Hamas [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=63.68s)]
*  during this operation. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  Now, I spoke last week with a doctor working at Shefa Hospital. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  He said the conditions there are difficult and that doctors have resorted to giving their [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=73.28s)]
*  own blood to treat patients. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=77.08s)]
*  While some food, water and supplies are reaching the facility, this doctor says it's not enough. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=79.0s)]
*  As for the extent of Hamas operations in the hospital, it's not clear how many militants [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=84.08s)]
*  the military believes are hiding in the compound. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=88.38s)]
*  We have reported extensively from Shefa and seen a tunnel network underneath the facility. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=91.38s)]
*  In addition to some weapons that were recovered from this area, we have not seen a compound [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=95.97999999999999s)]
*  and control center as the Israelis have claimed is there. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=100.66s)]
*  The question now is how this operation plays out today and whether or not Hamas will try [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=104.14s)]
*  to use this Israeli incursion into Shefa in their negotiations as leverage. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  Brian. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=113.86s)]
*  Trey, I know there sadly is civilian casualties since operations began 160 plus days ago. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=115.1s)]
*  But are we to believe that 30,000 and 70% of which are women and children? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=123.46s)]
*  We never hear about Hamas deaths or wounded. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=128.74s)]
*  We only get those numbers and they all come from Hamas's communication wing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=131.92s)]
*  Have you gotten anything more substantial than that? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=136.54s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=142.14s)]
*  I posed this question to everyone from the Defense Minister in Israel down to top military [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=143.22s)]
*  spokespeople and I've gotten an interesting response. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  They actually agree with the 30,000 number, but they say the Hamas-run Palestinian Health [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=150.94s)]
*  Ministry is not taking into account Hamas gunmen and fighters and other organizations [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=155.73999999999998s)]
*  like Islamic Jihad who lost militants in this war. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=161.14s)]
*  And they say there are more than 11,000 of them that are among those casualties. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=165.0s)]
*  So they do agree anywhere from one to two or one to one depending on who you ask at [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=169.74s)]
*  the civilian to militant ratio for those killed during this conflict. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  But they say that the numbers we're receiving from Gaza do not take into account the militants [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=178.86s)]
*  that have been killed. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=183.58s)]
*  Brian. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=184.58s)]
*  Trey Yanks, thanks so much for getting up for us. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=185.58s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJEP75HPS8&t=186.98000000000002s)]
