# Outrage over McIver charges: ‘Missed his calling as a comedian’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw)
*  So this morning a Democratic congresswoman is facing federal charges [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=0.0s)]
*  Lamonica McIver [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=4.44s)]
*  Accused of assaulting a police officer during the storming of a New Jersey ice facility [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=6.24s)]
*  It's the first time President Trump's DOJ has criminally charged a sitting lawmaker during his term [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=11.56s)]
*  Pointing to this video. They say shows are shoving past DHS ages earlier this month [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett joins us now [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=23.16s)]
*  Greg thanks so much for joining the program. Good morning [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=26.88s)]
*  I want to take her being a congresswoman off the table and just the laws that were broken here and what they're saying that they're [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=29.08s)]
*  Going to charge it with it is 18 us code [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=36.08s)]
*  111 a1 assaulting resistant impeding certain officers employees. That's forcibly assault [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=40.08s)]
*  Resist opposes impede intimidates or interferes with does she meet that? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=45.96s)]
*  Well the fed say [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  It does [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=55.32s)]
*  The body cam footage that they have that others haven't seen [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=56.68s)]
*  They say shows representative McIver committing assault under the statute and we've all seen some of the other video [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=60.88s)]
*  There's a lot of shoving going on but Lawrence understand that assault doesn't exclusively require [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=67.64s)]
*  physical contact it can include [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=75.04s)]
*  Intimidation or threats that create a reasonable apprehension of harm to a law enforcement [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=78.36s)]
*  Officer so, you know her words are equally as important as her physical acts and of course, she's presumed [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=84.92s)]
*  Innocent she'll get her day in court [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=92.92s)]
*  But if her defense is as she now claims that oh, I was just exercising legislative oversight [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=94.4s)]
*  That's not gonna work because lofty status as a member of Congress [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=102.52s)]
*  Confers no special exemption for criminal acts [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=107.36s)]
*  You know, she and her fellow Democrats could have made an appointment to inspect the detention facility [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=110.64s)]
*  That's the normal orderly process [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=116.76s)]
*  But instead Homeland Security says they stormed through a gate try to get past security [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=119.56s)]
*  That's when the melee occurred as officers. So stop them [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  Democrats spent the last four years telling us Lawrence that nobody's above the law. Well [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=130.84s)]
*  Representative MacGyver [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=137.44s)]
*  May find out that they were right about that. So let's say let's get her statement and this is this is her defense [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=138.88s)]
*  She says the charges against me are purely political [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  They mischaracterize and distort my actions and are meant to criminalize and deter legislative oversight [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=149.16s)]
*  This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=156.12s)]
*  Here's the problem either you're gonna be a member of Congress and provide oversight or you're gonna be an activist [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=162.34s)]
*  That is trying to shove your way in I think that's the part [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=168.1s)]
*  That is complicated here. Well, it's not really complicated, but this is what took so long for the administration to charge her [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=172.82s)]
*  I think she crossed the line here. What do you think? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=179.56s)]
*  Well, they had to interview witnesses [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=183.57999999999998s)]
*  They had to take a look at other footage that they had gathered and then make a judgment that takes time [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=185.7s)]
*  And you know, it's not just her [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=192.22s)]
*  Faux defense that you just put on the screen, but it's Hakeem Jeffries. You got a laugh at that guy [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=194.94s)]
*  He missed his calling as a comedian because he said oh these charges are extreme and morally bankrupt [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, they didn't say that about the criminal charges that were brought against [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=208.06s)]
*  President Trump and what I find so curious here is MacGyver had a chance to resolve this without any criminal charges at [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=212.74s)]
*  All she refused [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=220.5s)]
*  Yeah, which invites the question Lawrence did she want to be charged so she could continue her indignant [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=223.5s)]
*  television appearances where she fully embraces the mantle of victimhood and I also find it curious how [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=230.58s)]
*  Democrats rarely have ever complained about ICE detentions and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=238.42000000000002s)]
*  Deportations during the Biden administration. There were a lot of them and suddenly under Trump [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=242.82s)]
*  They're apoplectic that illegals with violent criminal records are being arrested and deported [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=247.42s)]
*  Well see that's the real issue there. They're defending the wrong people though [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=254.29999999999998s)]
*  The criminals behind those bars not people start in search of a better life [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=257.42s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining the program Greg. We appreciate it. I'm Steve juicy [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7RiN1Arhw&t=263.21999999999997s)]
