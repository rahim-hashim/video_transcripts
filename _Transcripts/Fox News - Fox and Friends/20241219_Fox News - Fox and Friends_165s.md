# Thousands of Amazon workers strike ahead of Christmas
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8)
*  If you have ordered a man bag, there's a possibility it may be delivered late because we got a Fox News alert just moments ago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=0.0s)]
*  The Teamsters Union has kicked off an historic strike against Amazon. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=7.76s)]
*  Workers at seven facilities across four states are walking off the job at this hour. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=12.32s)]
*  Yep. The rank and file are going to be walking the picket lines at hundreds of Amazon fulfillment centers nationwide. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=18.72s)]
*  This will allow warehouse workers and drivers without collective bargaining agreements to join in. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=25.44s)]
*  I didn't know they were unionized. So here we go. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=31.96s)]
*  If you're waiting on gift deliveries, they could cause big problems. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=35.56s)]
*  Six days until Christmas. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=39.36s)]
*  So the Teamsters Union represents around 10,000 workers at 10 Amazon facilities. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=40.96s)]
*  They say they're fighting for better benefits and safer working conditions at work. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  That's right. And those are live pictures right now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=51.32s)]
*  They are walking the line. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=53.4s)]
*  Fox five here in New York taking these images in Math Path, Maths Path, New York. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=55.44s)]
*  Amazon says there will be no impact to your holiday deliveries. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=63.32s)]
*  But keep in mind, it's at the Amazons in San Francisco, portions of Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta and Chicago. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=69.0s)]
*  And the union says if your package is delayed, something you wanted for Christmas and it doesn't show up, the union says blame Amazon's greed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=77.39999999999999s)]
*  Because what they're trying to do is they're trying to get a settlement before Christmas. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=87.8s)]
*  They want more money. They want to get paid more. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=91.96s)]
*  Teamsters organization, though, they're only 10,000 people that are affected. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=93.72s)]
*  And when you compare that to how many people work at Amazon, it's a small portion, because 1.5 million people work at Amazon. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=97.36s)]
*  So hopefully it's not going to affect your packages. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  But just be aware if you have your shopping, there could be a delay. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=107.72s)]
*  Well, they're definitely using this as a negotiation for they are fully aware that is the holiday season and people want their packages and they're using it to put some pressure on Amazon. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=111.52s)]
*  I'm not sure it's really going to work, though, considering the amount of people that are protesting. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=121.6s)]
*  I just say, you know, how president likes to be hands on. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=126.08s)]
*  Jeff Bezos having dinner with us last night and the Teamsters union president has already been down to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=128.12s)]
*  Have a great relationship. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he did not endorse Trump, but he didn't endorse a Democrat. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=134.6s)]
*  And they do get along. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=137.72s)]
*  So I think he could probably do a did you still do party lines or FaceTime? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=139.23999999999998s)]
*  You could FaceTime with two people or you could Zoom call. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=144.0s)]
*  You could. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  President Trump could end this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=146.6s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  I think President Trump needs to work on what we're about to talk about. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=148.88s)]
*  That's a transition. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elmmJ3Fpq8&t=152.95999999999998s)]
