# Iran looks at Biden and sees ‘complete and total weakness’: Expert
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY)
*  We're back with the Fox News alert right now Israeli airspace is back open while schools and large [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=0.0s)]
*  Gatherings remain canceled as Israel weighs its response to Iran's massive drone and missile attack [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=6.16s)]
*  Aryeh Lightstone served as a senior advisor to the former US ambassador to Israel joins us live from Israel with a firsthand look [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Aryeh, thanks. Thanks for joining us this morning. What was it like? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=19.52s)]
*  I'm being a part of that the anticipation of it and then the actual event itself [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=23.64s)]
*  Well, the anticipation was rather terrifying and the most terrifying part of it is explaining to your kids that they're going to be shot at again [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=27.84s)]
*  We have four kids all under the age of 15 and the prospect of spending yet another night in the bomb shelter was not anything that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  We were looking forward to but we spent most of the night watching the US and Israel and Jordan even in the UK [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=42.32s)]
*  Shoot down this horrendous attack from Iran and felt an enormous amount of pride [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=50.24s)]
*  And felt an enormous amount of pride about what Israel and the United States are able to do when they put their mind to it [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=54.32s)]
*  How much time did you spend in a bunker meaning like what was the exact or basic amount of time that the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=60.24s)]
*  Attack unfolded for someone that was in Israel [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=67.28s)]
*  Yeah, so we got reports at 11 15 p.m. Last night that drones had left Iran [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=70.8s)]
*  Which is a funny thing to watch in real time on X [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=75.48s)]
*  You know the country that you're staying in actually being attacked and it said it's gonna take anywhere between three and six hours for that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=78.72s)]
*  To come but don't worry [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  Simultaneous with that happening there will be cruise missiles launched from Iran that will get there faster and surface-to-surface missiles and expect [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=86.28s)]
*  Lebanon and Yemen to jump in as well as well as Syria [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=93.44s)]
*  And in general throughout the night there were reports that were happening [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=97.0s)]
*  You've got this red alert app which tells you where missiles can be hitting and when you need to go down to the shelter [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=100.68s)]
*  With four kids thought it was just more important to have everybody there in advance and not to wake them up in the middle of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=106.0s)]
*  And I was on sort of news watch throughout the night trying to figure out what was going on speaking to leadership in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=111.28s)]
*  Washington on the Republican side obviously and various other people who were concerned about [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  Friends and family in the in the area so it was an all-night event [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=122.2s)]
*  What's your sense? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=126.28s)]
*  We're trying to get a sense of whether or not Iran would have would have believed that this was a performative attack [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=127.28s)]
*  Meaning hey we have to do this [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=133.4s)]
*  But we don't really want to escalate or was your sense that the barrage was was so large and the different assets so [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=135.4s)]
*  Variant that they would have had to believe that it would have had some level of success [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=143.0s)]
*  I'd like to say that I think that point is well important. It's purely academic [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=149.16s)]
*  Iran looks at the Biden administration and sees complete and total weakness [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=154.08s)]
*  So they believe that when Biden says don't just look how Iran thumbed their nose at [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=158.2s)]
*  President Biden and they proceeded with this whether it was performative or whether it was deliberate over 300 [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=164.12s)]
*  Attack objects headed from Iran into Israel in the middle of the night by the way leaving a Saturday night leaving the staff [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=170.72s)]
*  preparing into Passover so much for the like the troops during the holidays and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  That action happening was testing whether Biden's don't was to Iran or whether it was to Israel and they put a bet [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=182.52s)]
*  That when Biden says don't he's talking to Israel just like all of the don'ts in the last six weeks have been about Israel [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=189.88s)]
*  And not about Hamas interesting. What do you think happens next? Are you what do you think? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=196.16s)]
*  What's the calculation of the Israeli government? Is there a response to this? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  It is an opportunity to advance and finish the job in in Gaza. What's next do you think? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=205.44s)]
*  Well, the lesson from October 7th is when somebody says they're going to kill you don't let them and what you had leading up to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=212.36s)]
*  October 7th literally a decade-plus of Israel receiving missiles day and night [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=218.76s)]
*  From Hamas and Gaza and being told limit your response [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  You've got this awesome air defense Israel continues to have an awesome air defense and was able with the United States of America and other allies [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  To shoot down Iran's missile barrage. That does not mean that is permitted to shoot at a sovereign country [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=235.14s)]
*  Israel will choose its time and place to be able to hit back and I would expect that hit to be rather explosive [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=241.11999999999998s)]
*  Because Biden's administration has been weak on this I don't expect it to be immediate but I expect it to be meaningful [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=246.76s)]
*  So you don't expect it to be a meaning immediate but you think it will be eventually a meaning [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  There will be a response to this interesting. Are you a lightstone? I'm glad you're glad your family's okay [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=258.96s)]
*  I'm sure it was a long night. We appreciate you joining us this morning. Thank you. God bless. Thank you [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwIIkMqWSY&t=263.36s)]
