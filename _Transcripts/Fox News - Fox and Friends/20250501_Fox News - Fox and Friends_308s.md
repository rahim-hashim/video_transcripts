# Released pro-Palestinian protester sends message to Trump: 'Not afraid of you'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE)
*  Meanwhile, let's talk about the poison, poison ivy and what's happened at these college campuses. We know about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=0.0s)]
*  About two weeks ago. They scooped up a guy who's by the name of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=6.44s)]
*  Ocean motion mud Dwari and they said okay. He thought he was going for a green card interview [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=12.16s)]
*  They pulled him out because he's one of the co-founders of this Palestinian student organization [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=18.8s)]
*  That helped organize all the unrest over the last two plus years and who knows what they were doing in our lower profile on the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=23.0s)]
*  Columbia College campus and they looked at and said as one of the founders of the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=29.6s)]
*  Palestinian Student Union we've seen your role and we're gonna try to deport you and the ice they went into a nice facility [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=34.36s)]
*  Yesterday a judge heard his case and said he is not a threat [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  So while we evaluate his immigration status, he got out and he didn't go out humbly [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  He came out defiantly and so I chose to call out [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=51.36s)]
*  President Trump listen [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  And I am saying it [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=58.4s)]
*  Clear and loud. Yes [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  To President Trump and his cabinet. Yes. I am NOT afraid of you never give up [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=64.8s)]
*  on the idea that justice will prevail and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=72.76s)]
*  That we have to come together to bring our voices and our hearts and raise them [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=77.24s)]
*  Not only for America not only for this system of democracy [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=84.84s)]
*  That has tricks and balances and this court is part of it [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=91.04s)]
*  But also for our humanity we have to restore and reform the international order and abide by [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=94.36s)]
*  International law as a first step towards justice. I don't care about international [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=101.76s)]
*  I care about the laws that govern this country and I think we're setting the dangerous precedent [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=106.72s)]
*  That we have the courts involved with the visa process [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=111.32s)]
*  So now every time someone doesn't like that their visa got denied or rejected. We have essentially said now that's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  Up to the courts of the side show me any statue that talks about the visa process [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  Sure, there's laws that govern our immigration process [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=126.94s)]
*  But when it comes to the visa process the Secretary of State has wide discretion and now we have a guy that's beating his chest [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=130.0s)]
*  He has anti-american views [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=137.28s)]
*  He's trying to destroy a lot of the things that we hold true to our country [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=139.68s)]
*  He stands with Hamas and a lot of the pro-palestinian [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=143.48s)]
*  Causes that are there that we don't support and now we're letting him celebrate it outside of the courtroom [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=147.56s)]
*  Not a good look well and after the judge ordered him released the government immediately said, okay judge do us a favor [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=153.6s)]
*  Keep him in [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=161.24s)]
*  Detainment for seven days and the judge said let me think about it. No, and so that's why [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=163.04s)]
*  Immediately. Well, he was trying to get citizenship. He was almost there and that's when he was arrested [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=169.32s)]
*  So the Trump administration says they're gonna fight to make sure he is not getting citizenship [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=173.6s)]
*  And keep in mind he co-founded the Palestinian Student Union after October 7th with [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=178.56s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil the other guy who has been detained they did this together. They caused chaos [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=184.24s)]
*  They caused riots on Columbia's University. We saw all the footage kids couldn't go to class. They disrupted everything [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=188.56s)]
*  That's right [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=194.84s)]
*  Come to our country and disrupt everything if you're gonna come to our country [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=195.56s)]
*  You need to love our country and not try to do this [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  This is what it looked like these two guys organized all of this incredible go to another country if you want to do that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=201.92s)]
*  It's not welcome here in America. Hopefully the next time we hear from him [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  He'll be making that speech in the West Bank or in Gaza [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=209.64s)]
*  Here's what the DHS said says when you advocate for violence [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=212.44s)]
*  Glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans and harassed Jews that privilege should be revoked and you [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=217.12s)]
*  Should not be in this country. We have the law facts and common sense on our side [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=223.72s)]
*  No judge not this one or another is going to stop the Trump administration from restoring the rule of law to our immigration system [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=227.48s)]
*  So I don't know if we have to do with all these 300 plus it [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=233.92s)]
*  Marco Rubio says that he's pulled off into these campuses [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=238.16s)]
*  But they're definitely haven't there's definitely a pushback by these left-wing judges to slow this process [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=241.76s)]
*  We need the Supreme Court to weigh in immediately and to establish the rule of law [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=247.6s)]
*  Which is the Secretary of State has wide discretion over this that way these judges can stop getting involved [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=252.0s)]
*  We need a stance a firm stance. So hopefully it'll come soon. We need to set a precedent [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=257.2s)]
*  You can't come to our country and do that's right [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=262.04s)]
*  I mean if we went to another country and did this we would be we would never we would never right and so it comes [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=263.76s)]
*  Down to your point about we need some clarity from the judicial system [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=269.08s)]
*  yeah, when it comes to the president using the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=272.84s)]
*  Aliens and enemies act can he do it because if they say yes, he can do it then that's just gonna send them all [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  What this is I don't know if this is I see that's what I was gonna say [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=283.32s)]
*  And I know we got to move on but this is just with not even when it comes to the aliens internet [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=286.64s)]
*  It is that the Secretary of State has wide discretion when it comes to approving visas [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=291.24s)]
*  All right, because they're guests in our country. I'm Steve juicy [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yC70RZjLyE&t=295.59999999999997s)]
