# RFK Jr. facing major fight in battle to change American food system
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM)
*  Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary nominee, R.F.K. Jr., promises to take on ultra-processed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=0.0s)]
*  foods and has pledged to make America healthy again. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=6.88s)]
*  We have a generation of kids that are swimming around in a toxic soup right now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=10.96s)]
*  They're letting these industries corrupt our agencies and mass poison them. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  It will be no small task. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=20.8s)]
*  A study from Northeastern University shows these foods make up 73 percent of our country's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=22.56s)]
*  food supply. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=29.4s)]
*  Here to discuss is Fox News Senior Medical Analyst, Dr. Mark Siegel. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=30.4s)]
*  Dr. Siegel, that is scary. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=33.68s)]
*  73 percent of our food supply ultra-processed. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=35.24s)]
*  Yeah, let me break this down this way. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=37.44s)]
*  Let's start with dyes. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  Food coloring is a problem. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=42.16s)]
*  Red dye number three has been banned in Europe. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=43.92s)]
*  They're banning it in California. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=46.44s)]
*  It's been associated with cancer in animals, but all of the food dyes have been associated [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=48.0s)]
*  with hyperactivity in children. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  So why is it legal? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=55.28s)]
*  We have too much hyperactivity in children. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=56.28s)]
*  Why is it legal here in America? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=57.28s)]
*  Why don't we just say ban? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=58.28s)]
*  Well, traditionally the Democrats have said ban. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=60.4s)]
*  Now R.F.K. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=63.96s)]
*  Jr. is saying this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  But of course the food industry fights back. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  The food lobbies fight back. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=68.28s)]
*  Traditionally, President Trump has not been a regulator. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=70.12s)]
*  So if there's a concern here that if this ends up with more regulations, that will drive [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=73.56s)]
*  prices up. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=78.04s)]
*  And food grocery store prices are already a problem. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=79.04s)]
*  Now let's look at ultra-processed food, Ainsley. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=82.04s)]
*  That also is a mess. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=84.92s)]
*  He says we're swimming in a toxic soup. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=86.06s)]
*  He's not kidding. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=88.14s)]
*  MSG causes you to eat more. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=89.14s)]
*  High fructose corn syrup? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=92.3s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=93.98s)]
*  That causes directly obesity. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=94.98s)]
*  And our ultra-processed foods are loaded with that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=97.42s)]
*  Nitrates, nitrites in our ultra-processed foods. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=100.18s)]
*  Again, cancer in animals. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=103.58s)]
*  Sugar, salt. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=105.9s)]
*  People just get drawn in to eat and eat and eat and they gain weight. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=107.48s)]
*  When they gain weight, they get high blood pressure. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=111.36s)]
*  They get diabetes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=112.98s)]
*  They get heart disease and they have a risk for cancer. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=114.3s)]
*  So he's on the right track. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=116.3s)]
*  Whether he can accomplish this is a different story. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=118.02s)]
*  How hard is it going to be when he has to fight big pharma, when he has to fight the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=120.02s)]
*  food industry? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=123.86s)]
*  I like how vocal he's being about it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=124.86s)]
*  He's putting a spotlight on it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=126.5s)]
*  Now the question is, what about the FDA? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  Because I don't really think, the FDA is part of the problem with cronyism, but the other [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=131.14s)]
*  issue here is, you already said it, it's the pressure being put on the FDA by the food [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=136.06s)]
*  industry, by the pharmaceutical industry, by the lobby groups in Congress. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=141.7s)]
*  They have so much power, they pretty much dwarf the FDA. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=145.1s)]
*  So he's on the right track. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=148.1s)]
*  Can he accomplish it? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=149.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=150.74s)]
*  And provide much of the budget of the FDA. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=151.74s)]
*  75% of their budget comes from these pharmaceutical companies. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=153.5s)]
*  Yeah, no, exactly. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=156.74s)]
*  And by the way, I also want to say, pharmaceutical companies are doing great things. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=158.3s)]
*  We're coming up with tremendous new treatments and biotechnologies soaring and artificial [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=161.9s)]
*  intelligence and personalized solutions. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=166.98s)]
*  So we don't want to squash Big Pharma and also startup companies look to Big Pharma [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=169.22s)]
*  and then bring them to the finish line. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=174.74s)]
*  All this is really important. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=176.34s)]
*  Where do they make most of the money? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=177.34s)]
*  Is it when you get sick, then you have to rely on their medicines? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=178.78s)]
*  Or is it whatever they're putting, these chemicals, these carcinogens they're putting in our foods, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=182.62s)]
*  they're making a lot of money there? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=187.26s)]
*  This is why I love coming on with you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=188.5s)]
*  Interesting, it's a form of addiction, isn't it? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=190.34s)]
*  It's a sick care system, what I talk about. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=192.34s)]
*  They should give tax incentives for going on the treadmill or taking a walk in the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=194.82s)]
*  morning or eating farm to table food or having more produce. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=198.1s)]
*  I want to see more produce in the schools. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=201.54s)]
*  R.F.K. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=203.3s)]
*  Jr. says that too. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=204.3s)]
*  We've got to go back to a healthier lifestyle and then we'll have less money spent on being [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=205.3s)]
*  ultra sick. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=209.98s)]
*  Yeah, I don't mind if people have choices. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=210.98s)]
*  You know, you talked about regulations and mandating this, but whatever's in my Coca-Cola, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=212.9s)]
*  I just want it to be safe. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=218.18s)]
*  I want to have that choice to have a Diet Coke or Coca-Cola or Cherry Coke or whatever, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=220.14000000000001s)]
*  but it's what's in it that worries Americans. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=224.9s)]
*  That leads to transparency, like we're talking about today. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=227.5s)]
*  The president, the future president coming January is drinking a lot of Diet Coke. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=230.22s)]
*  I'm going to tell you, President Trump, stop the Diet Coke, please. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=235.22s)]
*  Thank you so much, Dr. Segal, for coming on. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLpQlZiBAUM&t=239.18s)]
