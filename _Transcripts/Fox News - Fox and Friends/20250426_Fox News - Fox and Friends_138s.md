# Dem senator testing a ‘war plan’ to beat Trump, urges party to ‘ditch wokeness’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk)
*  Her strategy also, this is Slotkin's, focuses on language and tone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=0.0s)]
*  She said Democrats should stop using the term oligarchy, a phrase she said doesn't resonate [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=4.36s)]
*  beyond coastal institutions, and just say that the party opposes kings, and to beat [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=9.64s)]
*  their weak and woke rap, Democrats should channel the no BS energy of the lions' camel, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=15.34s)]
*  she said, a wonderfully sappy guy with his players, but who also is smart and tough and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  lovable. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  And you know, I don't know that the cussing is going to be like the thing that puts Democrats [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=29.8s)]
*  over it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=35.6s)]
*  They've been doing that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=36.6s)]
*  They've been doing that, by the way. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=37.6s)]
*  And Alyssa Slotkin is really leaning into it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=38.6s)]
*  It seems like maybe you're learning, that's maybe a lesson you learn from Trump, but I [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=40.88s)]
*  think it might be the wrong lesson to learn from Trump. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=45.52s)]
*  Yeah, listen, I think she's right. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=48.32s)]
*  Oligarchy is not like a rust belt, you know, call for, you know, she's right about that, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=50.44s)]
*  feels very East Coast, very, you know, elite college, kind of a conversation that you would [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=57.04s)]
*  have on the coast. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=63.68s)]
*  So she's right about that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=64.96s)]
*  But again, Slotkin, like all the Democrats, this is all when they when they try to put [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=66.24s)]
*  on the Trumpian mantle, when they try to put on the working class, you know, language, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=71.04s)]
*  and they, you know, they all got camo hats, remember during, and they thought they just [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=75.36s)]
*  put on a camo hat that meant they were for the Second Amendment, or people would at least [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=79.4s)]
*  believe it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=83.2s)]
*  It's all cosplay. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=84.2s)]
*  It's all fake. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=85.2s)]
*  None of their policies are actually for the working class. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=86.2s)]
*  And the best evidence of it is that Elise Slotkin, who's trying to say that she represents [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  Michigan is against this terraform. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=93.68s)]
*  Now, you can if you are a working class Michigan, Michigander, you like what Donald Trump is [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=95.84s)]
*  doing, you understand exactly why he's doing it, because this is a response to the gutting [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=102.0s)]
*  of these towns and these industries and these, you know, working class towns. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=108.08s)]
*  And so she's out of step and she'll say don't say oligarchy, say kings, because I don't [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=114.36s)]
*  know, she thinks her constituents, you know, can't handle that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=118.96s)]
*  But it's all fake. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=122.36s)]
*  Truly. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=123.36s)]
*  They've got big problems. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=124.36s)]
*  So we'll be having much more to come on Fox and Friends. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1DzSQTdKAk&t=125.36s)]
