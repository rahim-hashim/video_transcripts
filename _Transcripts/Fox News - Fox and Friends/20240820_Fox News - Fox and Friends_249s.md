# Hannity: This is not going to fly
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8)
*  I wish my mother and Kamala's mother could see us. They would say, keep going. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=0.0s)]
*  If you are a working parent trying to afford rent and childcare, Kamala is for you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=7.36s)]
*  If you are a senior who had to go back to work because your retirement didn't stretch far enough, Kamala is for you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=15.72s)]
*  Yep, it's too bad that she's been working for three and a half years and doesn't seem to be for them. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=25.0s)]
*  And so much for inflation, border crisis, Democrats wasting no time rewriting history last night, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=30.0s)]
*  hailing Kamala Harris while ignoring her role in the administration, which according to reports, she's still the vice president. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=36.0s)]
*  Sean Hannity joins us now. Sean, you had a chance to listen and work to a lot of these speeches. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=44.0s)]
*  Your thoughts about the short-term memory loss of people. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=49.0s)]
*  Brian, you raise a great point. First of all, my first observation, starting with jacked up Joe, we saw the return last night of jacked up Joe. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=55.0s)]
*  It was great to see. Perhaps if they gave him a little more Monster Energy drink or Red Bull in the months leading up to the coup, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=62.0s)]
*  he might still be the nominee, but apparently they didn't get the memo in terms of the DNC platform. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=72.0s)]
*  Look, I'm not sure why there was so much screaming last night. I mean, starting with Joe and then being in the hall. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=79.0s)]
*  Look, conventions are what they are. Every second is choreographed. Every line is approved. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=86.0s)]
*  Everything is predictable. But you raise a great point, and that is they're acting as though they've had nothing to do with the carnage [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=94.0s)]
*  and the damage that this country has been suffering through for the last three and a half years. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=104.0s)]
*  They cannot run on the economy because the economy for 66 percent of Americans is a disaster. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=108.0s)]
*  You know, all of us have put up on the screen and we've told people and people feel it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=115.0s)]
*  Every store that they go to, everything they buy, they're paying 20 plus percent more than they were paying under Donald Trump. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=120.0s)]
*  They are gulping water in the words of the American people. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=127.0s)]
*  So they're suffering there. We see now that they can't run on, Kamala can't run on her record. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=131.0s)]
*  She can't run on her own words. She can't run on the fact that she co-sponsored Medicare for All with Bernie Sanders, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=138.0s)]
*  universal health care, the elimination of private insurance. That's not going to fly with the American people. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=145.0s)]
*  They're not going to run on the Green New Deal that she also co-sponsored in the U.S. Senate with Bernie Sanders. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=152.0s)]
*  So they're in the middle of this Hollywood choreographed makeover. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=160.0s)]
*  Everybody in the hall is going to buy it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=165.0s)]
*  And the challenge for the Trump administration or the Trump campaign at this point is that they have got to make sure that America is fully informed [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=168.0s)]
*  as to how radical, extreme and how dangerous her policies are. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=178.0s)]
*  They're not going to run on, we're going to ban fracking and drilling. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=182.0s)]
*  They're not going to run on, yeah, well, those crazy protesters that don't understand murder and rape and torture and kidnapping and beheading. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=186.0s)]
*  Yeah, we can understand why they're protesting because I have a hard time understanding it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=195.0s)]
*  Try and inform the American people that live through 9-11-01 that radical Islamic terrorism is a word that we should no longer use [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=200.0s)]
*  or 11 million unvetted, illegal, you know, Harris-Biden immigrants that they want to decriminalize. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=208.0s)]
*  They want to give her amnesty to and give free health care and housing and education to. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=215.0s)]
*  They're not going to run on any of that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=220.0s)]
*  So this is show week and after the show is over and the games begin, but the challenge is to make sure that every American knows who they really are. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=222.0s)]
*  If they ran on what Kamala believes and what she has said she believes, I don't believe the American people will vote for her. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=231.0s)]
*  We'll catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DusH4Gun8&t=245.0s)]
