# Dems demand proof of life for detained MS-13 gang suspect
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg)
*  Four House Democrats visiting El Salvador, I know, as the party ramps up its efforts to return [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=0.0s)]
*  alleged MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia back to the United States. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=5.68s)]
*  We're not the first here. We're not going to be the last members of Congress fighting and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  demanding the return of Abrego Garcia. We have written a letter just as of 30 minutes ago to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=15.36s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio demanding daily proof of life for Mr. Abrego Garcia. He is a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=20.16s)]
*  father. He is a husband. He's a union member. I am a mother. The idea that Kilmar was detained [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=26.16s)]
*  from the front of his five-year-old son is heartbreaking to me. This is on Donald Trump. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=35.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard when you're a human trafficker and you beat your wife. Sometimes you might [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=41.76s)]
*  end up with law enforcement as a problem in front of your family. It comes after Maryland [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=45.68s)]
*  Senator Chris Van Hollen admitted to using taxpayer funds to visit the suspected gang member last [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=49.92s)]
*  week. Maryland State Delegate Kathy Shalegha joins us now. Congressman, thanks so much. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=55.28s)]
*  Is this where Maryland reps should be? Is this should be the focus of your state? Are all your [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=60.64s)]
*  other problems solved? Absolutely not. And look, Brian, I am very concerned that Senator Chris [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=64.8s)]
*  Van Hollen is making Maryland a magnet for criminal illegal immigrants. This man, Mr. Garcia, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  is not a Marylander despite the news continually calling him a Marylander. He is a Salvadoran [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=81.04s)]
*  national who was illegally living in Maryland. And I wish Senator Chris Van Hollen had as much [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=88.4s)]
*  concern for the victims of crime as he has for a man that's not an American. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=96.64s)]
*  Here's what Congressman Maxwell Frost said yesterday. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=103.84s)]
*  I'm not here to litigate even a very specific person. I'm here to talk about the fact that he [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=107.28s)]
*  represents a very big problem with this administration, that they have no problem scooping somebody up [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=114.56s)]
*  based on tattoos and vibes and sending them to a foreign country's prison. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=121.04s)]
*  I mean, how could he even say that? Did you look at the police report? He was at a home depot with [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=126.48s)]
*  known MS-13 operators. He has a rank within that organization. He's got the tattoos, the paraphernalia, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=131.12s)]
*  and an informant trusted said this guy's MS-13, let alone beating his wife, let alone being [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=137.36s)]
*  caught with seven other people trafficking them from Texas to Maryland. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=143.84s)]
*  You know, as the story unfolds, Brian, it gets worse and worse. But let's start from the very [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=149.6s)]
*  beginning. Mr. Garcia is an illegal immigrant. He came into this country illegally. He did not [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=155.92s)]
*  have permission. He was not vetted. And, you know, let's start there. He isn't afforded the rights of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=163.6s)]
*  an American citizen because he is not a citizen. And then as the story unfolds, we learn more and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=170.48s)]
*  Maryland has a problem with illegal immigrants that are criminals. Maryland's ICE is amazing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=179.2s)]
*  We lead the nation in sex offender apprehensions. The director of Maryland ICE is very focused [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  on the worst go first. And a tiny state like Maryland of six million people, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  we lead the nation in sex offender apprehensions by ICE and we're second in gang member [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=201.28s)]
*  apprehensions. So, you know, what Chris Van Hollen is doing, making a poster child of an illegal [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=208.32s)]
*  immigrant who has a rap sheet is not going to be good for the state of Maryland. Right. And by the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  way, Senator Van Hollen says he's got a track record of fighting against MS-13. I don't see any [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=221.68s)]
*  proof of that. Do you? Well, I think in 2006, you know, just a couple years ago, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=227.44s)]
*  he might have been on a work group about that. But that actually, Brian, I think makes it worse [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  because he understands how dangerous MS-13 is. And he should be calling on all of the local jails [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=239.04s)]
*  in Maryland and law enforcement to cooperate with ICE, follow the law. I don't know what his end [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=246.88s)]
*  game is. Mr. Garcia should not be welcome back to this country. He can be adjudicated [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=252.72s)]
*  from his own country. Thanks for speaking up, Congresswoman. Appreciate it. People of Maryland [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=259.2s)]
*  need people like you. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley Earhart. And click here [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGwCojpncLg&t=263.44s)]
