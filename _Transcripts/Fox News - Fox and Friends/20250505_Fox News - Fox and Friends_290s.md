# Book reveals shocking claims surrounding Biden's advisors
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es)
*  So, Ainsley, more stuff is coming about out about Joe Biden. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes, there's another book. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=3.0s)]
*  There's another book that's been written about the election 2024. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=4.0s)]
*  These three reporters, one from New York Times, one from Washington Post, and one from Wall [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=7.2s)]
*  Street Journal, they wrote this book. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=10.88s)]
*  It's called 2024, How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, set [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  to be released in July. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=16.52s)]
*  And they talk about, Brian, the, they debated, his advisers debated whether or not he would [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=18.12s)]
*  have a cognitive test back in February. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=23.14s)]
*  He said, yes, Biden's aides were confident that he would pass a test, a cognitive test, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=25.76s)]
*  according to the book, but they worried that the mere fact of him taking it would raise [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=31.28s)]
*  new questions about his mental abilities. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=35.72s)]
*  At the same time, Biden's longtime doctor, Kevin O'Connor, had also told aides he would [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=37.92s)]
*  not take the 81-year-old's president's political standing into consideration when treating [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=42.68000000000001s)]
*  him, which, by the way, you know, all doctors do that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=47.08s)]
*  Yeah, all doctors do. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  But put it this way, he wouldn't have passed the test. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  No way. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=51.8s)]
*  And the thing is, they knew it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=52.8s)]
*  So again, it makes me not want to read this book because of not being candid. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=54.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=57.68s)]
*  And the thing is, all these people, outside Alex Thompson evidently wrote about it earlier. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=58.68000000000001s)]
*  I haven't looked back and double-checked that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=63.6s)]
*  He wrote a book for Axios, and he writes it with Jake Tapper, now talking about all his [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=65.8s)]
*  failings, how he wasn't there, he was the president's, the president auto pen. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=70.6s)]
*  Well, and I think you hit it right there, Brian, when you said they're still not being [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=74.56s)]
*  honest about this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=79.12s)]
*  They're still lying about what they knew. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=80.12s)]
*  He's doing a few today. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=82.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=83.12s)]
*  I don't think any of them are going to ask the question about his mental acuity and what [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=85.04s)]
*  the conversations were like behind the scenes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=90.04s)]
*  I watched this live. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=93.36s)]
*  This was Jen Psaki talking about what happened on the debate stage. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  She says that she said, remember, she's a skilled communicator, but watch the stumble [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=99.44s)]
*  here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  Let's watch it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  I hadn't seen him in person during that period of time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  I never saw that person, not a single time, and I was in the Oval Office every day, that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=109.52s)]
*  was on that debate stage. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  I'm not a doctor. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=117.08s)]
*  Aging happens quite quickly. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=118.28s)]
*  Were things that people saw during that period of time that were similar to that, or would [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  have been in a category of that? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=124.16s)]
*  I don't know, possibly, right? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=125.64s)]
*  And all these books are going to tell us. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  Cover-up is a very loaded term, I think. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=128.48s)]
*  Well, it means you knew that it was really bad and you're pretending otherwise versus [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=131.0s)]
*  you're deluding yourself, which I think is what people do a lot. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=134.42s)]
*  Well, I understand, but I still think it's like cover-up is often like a crime, right? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=136.88000000000002s)]
*  I think it's a bit of a dangerous term. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=141.52s)]
*  Well, if they didn't know it, in February, we saw the debate four months later in June. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=144.0s)]
*  Did he age that quickly? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  They had to have known. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  They did know. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  And if you're behind the scenes, you're saying, let's don't give him a cognitive test, because [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  then if he fails, that information might come out. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=158.84s)]
*  So we're safe if we don't. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=161.66000000000003s)]
*  That is the same month in February, the same month that the Her Report came out. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=163.12s)]
*  And remember what the Her Report said? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=167.44s)]
*  And remember, these were findings from months before. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=169.4s)]
*  The Her Report said he was a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=176.84s)]
*  I read the whole report and he looked terrible in it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=177.84s)]
*  He couldn't hold the thought. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  He kept regressing back to his high school football days. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=181.44s)]
*  And he's like, and then they would say, sir, I understand. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  And at one point, we should talk about that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=187.88s)]
*  It was so polite. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=190.8s)]
*  It was so courteous, so deferential. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=192.6s)]
*  But they were relentless, saying, I need answers to these questions. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=194.94s)]
*  You know, what about even the decision to do it on October 7th, the day of the Israeli [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=197.68s)]
*  attacks? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  Any president would say, no, I've got to stay on the phone. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  We might have a Middle East war. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=205.8s)]
*  I might have to put my guys in motion. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=207.16s)]
*  No, I'm going to sit down with Robert Herr and talk about my past. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=208.72s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=211.84s)]
*  And by the way, if you don't believe it, when the B-roll of a story is indicting of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=212.84s)]
*  the person speaking, he freezes. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=219.04s)]
*  King Abdullah has no idea what direction he's heading behind him. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  He goes out on the lawn. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=226.16s)]
*  He can't walk across a small thing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=227.44s)]
*  Then, of course, you go see him go over the sandbag. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=229.44s)]
*  I mean, we see this in real life. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=231.56s)]
*  And if they felt any differently, they would have put him out there to do interviews. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  They wouldn't even let him do the Super Bowl interview. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=238.2s)]
*  Can we just go back to what Jen Psaki says? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  OK, I don't want to say cover up, because that would imply criminal activity. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=241.92s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  There are questions about what they did and if it's criminal. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  Who was using the auto pen? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  Were different military strikes and things like that approved by the president or not? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=255.76s)]
*  Did he actually sign some of the legislation and some of the executive orders? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=260.91999999999996s)]
*  Who decided that they were going to do all the pardons when the president was standing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=264.94s)]
*  on the stage with the next president of the United States? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=267.91999999999996s)]
*  All of those are legal questions. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=271.68s)]
*  And I'm sorry, it was a cover up. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=273.76s)]
*  And they're still not being honest about it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=275.64s)]
*  They're going to border and let millions of people come in. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1TYD2q1es&t=277.4s)]
