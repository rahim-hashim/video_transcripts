# Law enforcement at UCLA move in on anti-Israel encampment
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw)
*  You're looking now at what has generally been considered the front of the encampment, where [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=0.0s)]
*  they put up that big barrier of plywood boards, metal fences, and that seemed to be the last [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=4.96s)]
*  point the police were trying to get into. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=11.6s)]
*  But now they have made a move in the sort of right-hand corner of that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=13.56s)]
*  You can see them sort of towards the top of your screen there. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=18.48s)]
*  Now some of those protesters seem to be putting their hands up and walking out. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=21.92s)]
*  They'll be taken to the, at least I would say, eight or so buses that have lined up [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=27.04s)]
*  just off campus there, ready to take away those hundreds who will ultimately have to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=32.44s)]
*  be arrested here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=38.72s)]
*  So some of them are giving up. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=40.64s)]
*  Some though are clearly not willing to do so quite so easily. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=42.16s)]
*  They are among the ones who are shining those strobe lights into the eyes of the police [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=46.16s)]
*  officers as they stand ready to move in there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  As William was saying, we don't know for sure what kind of weaponry some of those protesters [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=55.36s)]
*  have. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=62.12s)]
*  We know that there are baseball bats in there. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=63.12s)]
*  We know that they are armed with pepper spray and mace, one of them, as you mentioned, Steve, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=65.24s)]
*  thank you for remembering, sprayed my wife the other day, a reporter with our local affiliate, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=71.2s)]
*  KTTV. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=75.68s)]
*  So we know they have those things. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=76.68s)]
*  We don't know how many of them are prepared to use them when faced with the kind of force [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  that these members of the California Highway Patrol are about to bring. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=84.48s)]
*  And they're probing the sides again now. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=89.68s)]
*  Yes, can we just think about this? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=91.84s)]
*  What is the goal here? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  Is the goal to make massive arrests or is the goal to take apart this encampment? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=95.64s)]
*  And do you get arrested only if you resist? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=101.2s)]
*  If you are just there, refuse to leave? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=104.84s)]
*  Are you going to be put on those prison buses? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=107.28s)]
*  So the goal for they just want to take apart this encampment and then deal with whoever [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=109.92s)]
*  wants to push back? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  They want to take apart the encampment and they will take they have declared this, remember, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=116.68s)]
*  an unlawful assembly. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=122.12s)]
*  They have issued a dispersal order. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=123.9s)]
*  So anybody not adhering to that dispersal order has been subject to being detained for the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=125.6s)]
*  last nine hours or so since that dispersal order was issued. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=134.84s)]
*  So pretty much every one of those people there that are there are going to be put on those [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=139.08s)]
*  buses. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=144.28s)]
*  Yeah, and you see them throwing items now towards the officers who are not going to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=145.28s)]
*  be bothered by those kind of items being thrown at them as they move in now very distinctly [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=149.6s)]
*  to begin trying to dismantle that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=154.04s)]
*  But as William was rightly saying, they have had a week now to build up this barrier and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=156.2s)]
*  they have done so very effectively. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=162.2s)]
*  And to that point, the cops are starting to take it apart right now with the bike racks. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  They're taking off the zip ties and anything that are keeping the bike racks together. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=170.28s)]
*  But the main fortification are those hundreds of pieces of plywood. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  How the hell did those get there? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  Did Home Depot make a couple of truckload stops over at UCLA right in the middle of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=183.0s)]
*  the quad? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they've been bringing them in over the week or so since they set up this encampment. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, there was no law enforcement to stop them and the UCLA administration didn't try [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  to stop anybody doing anything. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=202.4s)]
*  They allowed this encampment to be set up, did not declare it unlawful until about 24 [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=204.44s)]
*  hours ago. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=209.72s)]
*  Yeah, and Jonathan, after a riot broke out on the UCLA campus, they allowed the encampment [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=210.72s)]
*  to stay and then they announced that police were going to come in. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=216.96s)]
*  So, you know, people came out of the woodwork, they knew that this was going to happen. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  They had the 1,000 people, as William was reporting, to support the people inside the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  encampment. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  They brought in the plywood, they brought in the nail guns, they brought in the gas [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  masks, all in preparation, making this law enforcement work even more difficult to take [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  down this encampment. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=243.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  This has been set up since last Thursday, so a week now, and a week in which they could [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=246.24s)]
*  fortify everything, they could decide how they needed to make it as difficult as possible [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=252.24s)]
*  for law enforcement. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=257.68s)]
*  UCLA did not ask law enforcement to come onto the scene until after... [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  They're now trying to push and get in. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=264.84s)]
*  Yeah, they're pushing pretty effectively now. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=266.76s)]
*  William, I should ask... [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  That barrier won't last that long as they move in here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  What they're trying to do now is get eyes in. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=273.16s)]
*  They can't go in until they know what they're working with. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=274.16s)]
*  So they're trying to dismantle all of these bike racks that is connected to this plywood. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=278.16s)]
*  It's the structure. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=283.16s)]
*  William, I should ask, is on the scene. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=284.16s)]
*  William, things have gotten a little crazier in the last five minutes. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=286.16s)]
*  Yeah, they definitely are. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=289.16s)]
*  It looks like, I see an arrest right in front of me, but here the police are now trying [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=292.16s)]
*  to remove the plywood. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=296.56s)]
*  I can tell you some of those barriers are a pallet, and then they have three-quarter [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=297.96s)]
*  inch plywood attached to both sides. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=303.12s)]
*  But yeah, definitely police are now trying to make their entry at this point here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=305.47999999999996s)]
*  The crowd you can see over on the opposite side, they're trying to get in as well. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=309.47999999999996s)]
*  They've got a police line trying to hold them back. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=314.24s)]
*  Hey, William, you know what I'm wondering... [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=316.47999999999996s)]
*  Okay, they're now pulling out some of the pallets. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=317.96s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=319.96s)]
*  I'm wondering, is there a risk for the cops being surrounded? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=320.96s)]
*  I worry about their back end. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm sure they drill this all the time, but if they're outnumbered, even though they've [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=325.6s)]
*  got the equipment, could they be surrounded right now? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, technically we are surrounded, right? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=333.6s)]
*  So we're surrounded by buildings, and the buildings have alleyways, and each one of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  those alleyways is clogged with sympathizers, other students. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=340.24s)]
*  So technically we are. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=344.48s)]
*  But like I said, on the backside of where I am right now, there's another police line [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=345.48s)]
*  If you will, that crowd, which now looks in several hundred, maybe 500 people, they've [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=350.56s)]
*  got to keep them at bay. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=356.4s)]
*  Okay, it looks like we have a special entry team coming on my backside right now. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=357.4s)]
*  They're very heavily armed. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=362.08s)]
*  Officers trying to make an entry point here, and they're backed up by two LAPD lines. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=364.48s)]
*  They've got their tear gas ready, and their clubs and their face masks are down. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=371.2s)]
*  So they're going to make an entry point there, and it's really, go ahead. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=376.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, there was a plan in place, and the plan was released by law enforcement sources, because [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=381.0s)]
*  there are different law enforcement agencies all working together to get this whole thing [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  sorted out. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=389.56s)]
*  Los Angeles Police Department will secure the perimeter. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=390.56s)]
*  California Highway Patrol will enter the encampment, and the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department will [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=393.64000000000004s)]
*  be responsible for crowd control. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=398.72s)]
*  So the protesters have had time to fortify, to get the gas masks, to get those flashing [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=401.88s)]
*  lights to blind the police officers. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=406.44s)]
*  Police also have a plan in place as well. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=409.08s)]
*  Hey Mike. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=411.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure they do, but things have been changing pretty dramatically in terms that [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  they've got to look at what's happening on the ground and where the soft point is. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=418.2s)]
*  Now they're going in literally through the front door. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=423.08s)]
*  Well, it looks like every time the police takes down a barrier, there's another one, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=427.12s)]
*  and they're finally making their way in right now. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=432.2s)]
*  And it looks like there are either hundreds inside the encampment, William, or else they [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=434.8s)]
*  have just come up to get in the grill of the cops. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=440.04s)]
*  Okay, they're bringing out their riot batons right now. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=444.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=448.48s)]
*  And they're throwing stuff at the police right there. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr5XkjkwdHw&t=449.48s)]
