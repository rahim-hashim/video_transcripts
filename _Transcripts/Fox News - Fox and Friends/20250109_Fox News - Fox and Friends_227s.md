# Louisiana plans to sue Biden admin over offshore drilling ban: 'One last kick in the gut'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs)
*  Well, the state of Louisiana is planning to sue the Biden administration over its last-minute offshore drilling ban. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=0.0s)]
*  And while it doesn't extend to their shores, it could have major implications for [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=6.36s)]
*  Louisiana's economy. Because that is one of the top states in crude oil reserves and productions, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=12.06s)]
*  and home to half the storage sites for our strategic petroleum reserves. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=17.7s)]
*  So it's very important. Here to discuss this pending lawsuit is Louisiana Attorney General, Liz Merle. Liz, good morning to you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=22.46s)]
*  Good morning. How are you this morning? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=30.12s)]
*  I'm doing okay, but you know, I'm sure and we heard from President Trump a couple of days ago on the way out [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=32.0s)]
*  Joe Biden's trying to stab him in the back when it comes to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=38.24s)]
*  His plan to on day one drill baby drill now with Joe Biden. It's kind of like yeah, you got to go to court first [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=41.64s)]
*  Well, it's kind of one last kick in the gut before he walks out the door and we've been fighting these policies from the day [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  He took office and started this assault on the oil and gas industry and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=56.699999999999996s)]
*  You know Louisiana certainly has been a leader in that in that that fight and I'll continue to do that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=61.66s)]
*  We we just you know, can't let this kind of action stand [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  Right and it you know, Donald Trump has said that as soon as he takes office [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=72.38s)]
*  He will you know get rid of it, but it's not that easy [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=76.82s)]
*  Because the way the Biden people put it in it's pretty much law [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=80.62s)]
*  That's why you're filing the lawsuit [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=84.94s)]
*  So the you know, the lawsuit comes out, let's say next week the Biden administration would defend their position in court [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=86.74s)]
*  But then when Donald Trump takes over suddenly you got the Trump people at the DOJ [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=94.3s)]
*  That's probably gonna be a different a different outcome you would think [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=98.22s)]
*  Well, you know it is kind of interesting [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=103.3s)]
*  I think there there could be an interesting delegation problem with the way that Congress has handed this power over to the president [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=105.3s)]
*  Where would she can exercise purely by executive order and then not have it challenged any other way? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=113.5s)]
*  We certainly will ask and hope that Congress acts quickly to undo this [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=119.58s)]
*  But we will litigate those issues and and make sure that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=125.62s)]
*  We're not just standing idly by waiting to see if Congress can do something, right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  Louisiana as you know has been in the news. It was just a week or so ago that there was a terrible [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=135.01999999999998s)]
*  Bourbon Street massacre and I know you're calling for an investigation into what went wrong because had those security barriers been up [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=140.89999999999998s)]
*  It would have been completely different. What's the status of this? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  Well, my review is just starting and and that's gonna be a [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=153.17999999999998s)]
*  methodical process of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  Collecting documents and interviews and looking at other studies that have been done in that area to kind of get a better understanding [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=159.42s)]
*  Of how we got here kind of inside the political and legal and and and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=166.45999999999998s)]
*  Cultural structure in New Orleans and I think that you know, what we want to do is kind of walk through it [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=173.54s)]
*  Carefully and see all of the different [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=180.17999999999998s)]
*  Influences that kind of led us to the place that we are at today [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=183.66s)]
*  And I can tell you that there's substantial changes that have been put in place leading into the Super Bowl [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=187.06s)]
*  But we want to make sure that we're making some permanent changes when all those federal resources are gone [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=192.82s)]
*  Absolutely because that one of those fixed barriers was broken for a very long time [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=198.22s)]
*  Everybody knew it wasn't working and that is the vulnerability that the driver took advantage of Liz Merle the Attorney General for the great [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=203.54s)]
*  State of Louisiana Liz. Thank you very much [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=211.29999999999998s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me you bet. I'm Steve juicy [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwEIAlO9NHs&t=214.54s)]
