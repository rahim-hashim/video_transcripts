# ‘PAYBACK TIME’: Biden seems to ‘undermine’ Harris campaign, Gingrich suspects
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4)
*  Playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=0.0s)]
*  These are the height of emergency situations. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=4.8s)]
*  It's just utterly irresponsible and it is selfish. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  The governor of Florida has been cooperative. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=11.28s)]
*  He said he's gotten all that he needs. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  I talked to him again yesterday and I said, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=15.88s)]
*  whoever, I said, no, you're doing a great job. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=19.2s)]
*  It's all being done well. We thank you for it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=21.76s)]
*  President Biden debunking his vice presidents [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=26.12s)]
*  claim that Florida Governor DeSantis is politicizing the hurricane response. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=28.48s)]
*  Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich thinks it's just one way Joe and Jill Biden [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=33.68s)]
*  are trying to undermine Kamala Harris in the final weeks of the race. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=38.04s)]
*  He joins us now to explain. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=42.24s)]
*  Speaker, it's so great to have you on. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  And I guess great minds think alike because I've been saying the same thing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=46.64s)]
*  I'm like, this is Jill's revenge. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=50.56s)]
*  Explain why you think Joe Biden is, you know, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  interfering with with the Kamala campaign, with what he's saying. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=57.44s)]
*  And also you're you're you've been saying that you think this is a sign of a collapse of this campaign. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=62.08s)]
*  Well, I think the combination of President Obama's anger directed a young black man [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  and Joe Biden directly contradicting Kamala Harris, not just in the clip you had, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=76.08s)]
*  but remember earlier for the first time in four years, he came into the briefing room [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=82.8s)]
*  and he said a whole series of things that undermined Kamala Harris's campaign. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=88.16s)]
*  And I think part of the reason that on the view and in other sightings, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=95.44s)]
*  she can't tell you anything different that she would do from Biden, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=99.92s)]
*  is she's afraid that if she makes him mad enough that he'll go all out to defeat her. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  My personal hunch is that that Jill and Joe have decided that their place in history will look [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  bigger if he's the only person ever to defeat Trump. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  And I suspect also there's a certain resentment that people said he couldn't campaign. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  And look how badly she's campaigning. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  And I think it's sort of like payback time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's so fascinating. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=130.64s)]
*  And the person holding the bag, if Kamala doesn't win, is going to be Barack Obama, correct? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=131.92s)]
*  Well, I think certainly we'll see what happens in neighborhoods that he's attacking. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=136.8s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing. Candidates shouldn't go out and attack their own base. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  And he was pretty angry and pretty blunt. And I'm not sure that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=149.68s)]
*  a lot of black males, when they go to the grocery store or they go to fill up their car, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=154.16000000000003s)]
*  I'm not sure they want to be lectured by Barack Obama from his mansion in Nantucket, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  telling them what they can and can't do. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=164.48s)]
*  So I thought it was goofy on his part. But let me, if I could for a second, Rachel. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=166.48s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=171.84s)]
*  My greatest threat, my greatest concern right now [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=172.48s)]
*  is that there are public acknowledgments that the Iranian dictatorship is trying to kill [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=175.76s)]
*  President Trump. And we need to recognize there's a huge difference from a 20-year-old [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=181.2s)]
*  with a rifle in Butler, Pennsylvania, and a kill team sent by the Iranians. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=186.0s)]
*  And I think it's unconscionable that President Biden, who said publicly [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=190.96s)]
*  President Trump can have whatever he needs. They haven't gotten the military aircraft. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=196.24s)]
*  They haven't gotten the military support against a potential drone attack. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=200.4s)]
*  President Trump is very vulnerable, in my judgment, if the Iranians are allowed to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=204.72s)]
*  continue. And we frankly should say openly and clearly, any Iranian dictatorship against a major [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  American political leader will be considered an act of war, and we would retaliate accordingly [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=216.56s)]
*  in a very massive way. You cannot have a dictatorship thinking that it can send [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=222.48s)]
*  assassins into your country to kill your political leaders. This isn't about Trump. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=228.32s)]
*  This is about the very viability of the American system and whether or not we're going to tolerate [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=232.72s)]
*  a foreign dictator trying to kill one of our leaders. And the Biden administration is being [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=237.84s)]
*  very slow and not doing what they need to do. I'm genuinely worried about this. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=242.88s)]
*  Well, I'm genuinely worried for the president's safety as well. But the last two people tried to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  assassinate him were Democrats. So I'm not sure where I stand about that. But [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=253.44s)]
*  he should get everything he needs. It's very, very clear. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=260.56s)]
*  And Biden did say that he would approve that. It should be happening right now, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=263.68s)]
*  though, and your point is well taken. Very quick before you go, what do you expect to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=268.08s)]
*  happen in the next three weeks? Because it feels like so volatile right now. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=271.92s)]
*  I think, look, I think she'll panic. I think it'll be clearer and clearer that she's losing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think Democrats running for the Senate and the House will panic and start saying, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=282.24s)]
*  you need to elect me to balance off President Trump when he wins. When that starts to happen, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=286.8s)]
*  you know that it's over. But you can see, by the way, in early voting patterns, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=292.24s)]
*  the Democrats are way behind where they were in 2020. And I think it's because nobody's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  inspired to go out and vote for Kamala Harris. Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=301.04s)]
*  Momentum does seem to be building up for Donald Trump. We'll see what happens. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=305.92s)]
*  Always great to get your thoughts, Speaker Gingrich. Great to have you on today. Thank [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuoey6Fwxw4&t=310.40000000000003s)]
