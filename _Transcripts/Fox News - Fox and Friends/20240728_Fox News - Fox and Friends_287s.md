# Israel is ‘paying the steep price’ for America’s loss of deterrence: Mark Dubowitz
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8)
*  A Fox News alert. Israeli forces announcing their first retaliatory strikes on Hezbollah [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=0.0s)]
*  targets in Lebanon after rockets struck an Israeli playground, killing 12 children and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=7.04s)]
*  teenagers in the deadliest attack since October 7th. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=13.38s)]
*  issuing a stark warning, vowing the terror group will pay a heavy price for the horrific [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=19.04s)]
*  attack. Here with more is CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Mark Dubowitz. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=24.6s)]
*  Mark, this is a national tragedy for the state of Israel, the deadliest day since October [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=30.92s)]
*  7th, when children thought that they were safe enough to play soccer outside in the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=35.56s)]
*  park. And now 12 families, possibly more, are in mourning. Before we get to next steps [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=40.92s)]
*  and what this could spark, how is Israel responding to this tragedy? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=47.0s)]
*  Well, it's a day of great grief and obviously funerals for these kids and the Israeli people [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=52.36s)]
*  who are just furious. I mean, Hezbollah has fired 7,000 missiles and drones and rockets [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=62.56s)]
*  at Israel since October 8th. There have been 40 Israelis killed, including these children, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=67.52s)]
*  and 60,000 Israelis have been driven from their homes in the north. So Israelis are [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=72.24s)]
*  furious and they're calling on their government to respond. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=76.52s)]
*  Israel has already responded. They struck deep into Lebanon, which is the headline, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=80.27999999999999s)]
*  but they hit Hezbollah military depots and infrastructure. Is it safe to say that Israel [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=86.16s)]
*  is not done responding? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  The prime minister is meeting with his cabinet today and considering options, but I think [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=93.72s)]
*  Israel is certainly not done responding. And the real question is, is Israel going to strike [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=100.0s)]
*  deep into Lebanon, deep into Beirut? Are they going to go after Hezbollah strongholds in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  Beirut, kill senior commanders? Are they going to go after Hezbollah's terror chief Hassan [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=109.6s)]
*  Nasrallah, who is ultimately responsible for all this blood? And if they do so, are they [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=113.8s)]
*  prepared for what is going to be a massive war and a massive retaliation striking central [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=119.32s)]
*  Israel, including Tel Aviv, where I am today? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=124.83999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Well, here's a quote from a U.S. official given to Axios. What happened today could [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=126.88s)]
*  be the trigger we have been worried about and tried to avoid for 10 months. Is Israel [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=131.1s)]
*  capable of fighting a two-front war? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's actually a seven-front war for Israel right now with Lebanon and Syria, the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=139.16s)]
*  West Bank, Gaza, the Houthis attacking them from Yemen, Iraqi Shiite militias from Iraq [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=145.16s)]
*  and Iran itself, which attacked them directly on April 13th. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=152.16s)]
*  So the problem is that the Biden-Harris administration's policy has completely failed. I mean, the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=155.24s)]
*  policy is to ask Israel to stand down. They've put immense pressure on Israel. They're not [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=159.8s)]
*  providing Israel with the munitions that Israel needs to fight a seven-front war. And they [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=164.26s)]
*  followed a strategy of maximum concessions to Tehran, and it's really been a collapse [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=168.36s)]
*  in American power, a deterrence, and Israel is now paying the steep price for this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=173.62s)]
*  So yesterday, Israel delivered an updated hostage and ceasefire negotiation. Apparently, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=178.36s)]
*  Netanyahu has added some new demands that include maintaining control of the Gaza-Egypt [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=183.28s)]
*  border to prevent the flow of weapons and militants. And that sounds like it could prolong [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  things. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=196.36s)]
*  Well, Israel has been proposing numerous deals for months. Hamas has been rejecting them. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=199.36s)]
*  And again, I mean, unfortunately, the Biden-Harris administration has been putting immense pressure [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=205.72000000000003s)]
*  on Israel to concede and not on Hamas and their Qatari sponsors in Doha. So this may [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  prolong things. Israel needs to retain some sense of control over that essential crossing. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=215.24s)]
*  Otherwise, after this war, Hamas will merely replenish its weapons, its terrorists, and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  Israel will face, God forbid, another October 7th all over again. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=225.88s)]
*  And finally, Mark, if Trump does become the next president, how would you like to see [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=229.2s)]
*  him handle this situation? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=232.2s)]
*  Well, if Trump becomes the next president, I think Trump needs to restore American power [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=233.44s)]
*  and deterrence. He needs to set a clear message to Tehran and to Iran's supreme leader, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  Ali Khamenei, that the United States will use not only instruments of American power [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=243.16s)]
*  against Iran, but will provide Israel with everything it needs to fight this war against [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  Iran. I think that Trump sends a message that, you know, there's, Trump has, I think Israelis [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=252.2s)]
*  would say speaks Arabic and Farsi, not in the literal sense, but in the notional sense [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=257.48s)]
*  that he understands this region and he understands that power and American deterrence is essential [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=262.0s)]
*  for preventing a regional war. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=269.0s)]
*  Mark, we are all with you in mourning the loss of these 12 children. Mark Dubowicz, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=270.48s)]
*  Life for Us in Tel Aviv. Thank you, Mark. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceR7A0nw6T8&t=274.68s)]
