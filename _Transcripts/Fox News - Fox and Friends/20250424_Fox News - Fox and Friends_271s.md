# New details reveal deported man's alleged links to human smuggler
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A)
*  All right, we are learning new shocking details about the suspected MS-13 gang member Kilmar [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=0.0s)]
*  Albrego Garcia, who was deported to El Salvador famously. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=7.44s)]
*  Griff Jenkins joins us right now from Washington with the latest details. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=12.44s)]
*  Griff, we've heard, you know, he was never charged with anything. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=15.52s)]
*  He was never, you know, there's a lot we don't know, but we're piecing it together slowly. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=19.0s)]
*  Well, that's right, Steve. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  Ainsley Bryan, good morning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  We're learning more about the Maryland man. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=28.12s)]
*  Remember that Democrats are rallying around. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=29.92s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=31.8s)]
*  DHS sources confirming to Fox Digital that suspected MS-13 gang member Kilmar Albrego [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  Garcia was driving an SUV belonging to a confessed human smuggler when he was pulled over in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=37.24s)]
*  Tennessee in 2022. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=43.52s)]
*  He was stopped for speeding, but according to the trooper, he allegedly, quote, pretended [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=45.34s)]
*  to speak less English than he was capable of and attempted to put encountering officer [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  responding to questions with questions. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=57.12s)]
*  Brego Garcia, though, was ultimately released with a warning for driving with an expired [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=60.44s)]
*  license. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=64.44s)]
*  It comes as a battle is waging over his deportation to El Salvador last month with legal questions [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=65.44s)]
*  over his due process, which drug czar Tom Homan is vigorously defending. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=70.72s)]
*  Two federal judges issued an order removal. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=76.64s)]
*  He has an order removal. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=79.6s)]
*  He has home. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=80.84s)]
*  We removed the gang member terrorist whitebeater from this country because the court ordered [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=81.88s)]
*  him deported. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=86.44s)]
*  So I keep saying this regard the worst. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  The best can happen for him, Sean, is he does come back to United States. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  We detain him immediately and we immediately remove him. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=94.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, out in New Mexico, Judge Joel Cano resigned last month without explanation [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=97.88s)]
*  after a suspected trend, a Ragu√°, TDA gang member who had allegedly been living on the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  judge's property was arrested. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=108.82s)]
*  Now, according to court documents, this guy, Christian Ortega Lopez, had been doing odd [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  jobs for Cano's wife before being offered lodging in the couple's casita following [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=115.6s)]
*  his eviction from an El Paso apartment. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, during his stay, he apparently became acquainted with the judge's daughter, who [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  allegedly allowed him to handle her firearms. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=128.68s)]
*  And finally, speaking of TDA, the Justice Department announced yesterday they have indicted [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=132.32s)]
*  a high ranking TDA gang member in custody in Colombia in the first case of charging [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=137.28s)]
*  a TDA gang member with terrorism related crimes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=142.72s)]
*  Attorney General Bondi says it's an inflection point in just how serious this administration [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=146.32s)]
*  is after going after that foreign terrorist organization. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=150.76s)]
*  Brian Ainsley and Steve? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  So Griff, they're looking at the TDA and now they're saying that Maduro sent them here [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  to create havoc and to hunt down other Venezuelans that were disloyal to Maduro. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=160.0s)]
*  Is there proof of that type of organization? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=165.0s)]
*  That's a great question, Brian, because for the first time we heard FBI Director Cash [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=168.6s)]
*  Patel say publicly that he believes TDA is the, quote, violent arm of the Maduro regime. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=173.04s)]
*  Now, we don't know exactly what connection the two have and we don't have people down [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=180.08s)]
*  in Venezuela that's working on that, but clearly this administration has been looking into [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=185.9s)]
*  it and hopefully we'll learn a little bit more about that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=191.28s)]
*  That would be quite a significant alliance. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=193.98s)]
*  Yeah, and backing up to a little bit about you were talking about the TDA member was [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=196.26s)]
*  living essentially on the property of that judge. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=201.7s)]
*  It's shocking because you would think that the judge would do a background check. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=204.45999999999998s)]
*  Did the judge know he was a gang member or just thought, okay, he's very handy and I [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=209.06s)]
*  need somebody? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=214.06s)]
*  We simply don't know that, Steve, and you know, it appears in all we have to look at, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=215.82s)]
*  we don't know why the judge resigned last month, but clearly it could possibly be the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=222.48s)]
*  case that he was dealing with the arrest of this TDA gang member, but it appears that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=227.5s)]
*  he ended up doing these odd jobs for the judge's wife. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=233.64s)]
*  The judge seemed to bring him in and put him in this casita, a little house on the property, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=236.72s)]
*  but ultimately the authorities realized that this guy was illegally in the country, came, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=242.72s)]
*  and apparently was in possession of some firearms, unclear whose firearms he was in [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=249.48s)]
*  possession of. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=255.23999999999998s)]
*  He thought it was Cato Kaelin. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=256.24s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=258.24s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=259.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-INwt9yH_A&t=260.24s)]
