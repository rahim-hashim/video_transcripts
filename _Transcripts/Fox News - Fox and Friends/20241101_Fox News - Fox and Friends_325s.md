# Kayleigh McEnany: This is a HUGE scandal
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY)
*  So the Harris campaign, Syria, gets Mark Cuban dishing out this insult. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, you never see him around strong, intelligent women, ever. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=7.28s)]
*  It's just that simple. They're intimidating to him. He doesn't like to be challenged by them. And [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=12.4s)]
*  you know, Nikki Haley will call him on his nonsense with reproductive rights and how he sees and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  treats and talks about women. I mean, he just can't have her around. It wouldn't work. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=24.0s)]
*  Now, prominent Republican women in Trump's orbit are putting Mark Cuban back in its place. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=29.2s)]
*  The mainstream media covers for Kamala Harris, and they don't hold her to the same standard [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=35.68s)]
*  that they hold Donald Trump. She should take it upon herself. Go to a microphone today, Kamala [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  Harris, and condemn this disgusting insult on more than half of the females in this country [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=44.72s)]
*  who want to support Donald Trump. What they stand for and what they believe is not where America is [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=49.44s)]
*  today. So when he came out, you know, they're in full panic mode, I think, on the other side. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=55.52s)]
*  And I think that from calling our side Nazis to garbage to now calling women [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=60.64s)]
*  dumb and unintelligent and weak around Donald Trump, almost as the last straw for 100 million [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=65.68s)]
*  women in this country. If you are a school teacher, if you are a U.S. military member, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  and you are a woman and a Trump supporter, then to Mark Cuban, you are stupid and weak. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=76.88s)]
*  It's a disgrace and Kamala Harris stays silent. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  Cuban's words are mean, sad, and misogynistic. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  And just a hunch, but I bet on election day, strong, smart women will remember. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=91.36s)]
*  I'm proud to join the millions of smart, intelligent women who will stand with [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump this Tuesday. So our next guest is one of them, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=101.92s)]
*  Kayleigh McEnany. Look at her resume right there. Harvard Law grad, law school, a former [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=105.92s)]
*  White House press secretary, best-selling author. And now she's a Fox News host and a mother of two, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=111.6s)]
*  and she joins us right now. So that's just a resume. Kayleigh, I think you're an accomplished [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=117.04s)]
*  woman. What did he mean by that? You know, that was very kind introduction there. I will say, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=122.72s)]
*  I can't interpret his words. They were crazy. If he wants to test his theory that Donald Trump [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=128.08s)]
*  doesn't surround himself with intelligent and strong women, I'm happy to do that if he wants to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=133.04s)]
*  have a Lincoln-Douglas-style debate about the issues of our time. I can test his hypothesis, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=136.48s)]
*  and I can prove his hypothesis wrong. But it's not about me. It's not about the other amazing, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=141.12s)]
*  accomplished women who are on the cover of the New York Post. It's about you. It's about the viewer. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=145.68s)]
*  It's about the women I met at rallies, the mothers, the hard workers, the accomplished [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=149.84s)]
*  professionals, those who are working in all different types of industries, smart, innovative. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=154.64s)]
*  That is what this is about. He insulted them, and there is no place for that in this country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=159.68s)]
*  And look, he gave an apology. I guess that's better than an apostrophe, which is what Joe [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=164.8s)]
*  Biden gave us. But I have cause to question the apology when he doubled down on his statement. He [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=168.56s)]
*  said, ever. And then he said, that is the truth. Or he made some kind of intuition there, a double [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  down, an underscore of his statement. There wasn't this aha moment after he said it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=180.32s)]
*  So real quickly, in the final stretch, I mean, you take these comments, you take the garbage [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=184.08s)]
*  comments, I mean, all of them together. This can't be good for the final stretch, right? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=189.68s)]
*  Not at all. Look, voters are used to this. If you support conservatism, if you support [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump, if you are half of the country, you have been called deplorable, irredeemable, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  garbage, unintelligent. We can't find countries on a map if you watch CNN's Don Lemon. Like, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=204.72000000000003s)]
*  that is what we have been told. People talk about get out the vote operation. And yes, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=211.04s)]
*  that matters going out knocking on doors. This might be the single biggest get out the vote [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=215.04s)]
*  operation. Thank you, Joe Biden and Mark Cuban. There's another controversy in the White House, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=219.28s)]
*  right? The stenographer's office, they're upset about what's happening. These are career officials, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  they're not partisans. I got to be honest, I had never heard of this office before this, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  but they're pushing back on the White House changing the record. Yes. So I mentioned that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=233.84s)]
*  apostrophe. The White House immediately pointed to a transcript because there was an apostrophe [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=238.88s)]
*  there. They said Joe Biden wasn't insulting supporters. And I immediately thought, okay, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  well, the transcript is created by career government officials. So not Kareen Jean-Pierre, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=247.12s)]
*  there's a stenographer who's in the room who takes notes and has a transcript. But the transcript is [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=251.2s)]
*  not meant to amplify your message. It's meant to verify the truth. I remember one time a reporter, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=256.48s)]
*  we thought, shouted a really crass word at me. We went to the stenographer not to change a [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=262.4s)]
*  transcript, but to verify what was said. The White House changed the transcript. And you have career [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=266.32s)]
*  government officials saying, we gave a transcript to the National Archives that is different from [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=272.32s)]
*  what the White House edited. This is a huge scandal. This is literally changing the truth. And every [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=277.04s)]
*  reporter should be very angry at this breach of trust. You know, I just think about if you were, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump's administration, you were the press secretary, and this happened in your press shot, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=287.84s)]
*  what would the response be? And it wouldn't be as kind as we see right now. I would have been [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  cannibalized and eaten alive quite literally by Gemma Costa, Kaitlyn Collins and John Carl. I [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=298.8s)]
*  wouldn't have made it out of the room if I had done this. Let's see what happens to Kareen Jean-Pierre [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=303.76s)]
*  today. Nothing. Thank you so much. If you want more of Kayla, you should check her out on Outnumbered [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=307.44s)]
*  today at noon. Thank you so much, Kayla. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  And most compelling analysis. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm3WCuyQUoY&t=322.08s)]
