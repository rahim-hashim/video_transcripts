# FOX Weather reporter rescues woman from car as floodwaters rise
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA)
*  We were with Bob just a little while ago, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=0.0s)]
*  and he said, hold on, I'm gonna go help that lady [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=2.2s)]
*  in that car, and he joins us right now [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=5.2s)]
*  from one of the areas around Atlanta. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=8.28s)]
*  Bob, tell us, when we saw you last, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=11.88s)]
*  there was a lady in that white car behind you, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=16.48s)]
*  and we could hear her screaming, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=19.32s)]
*  screaming her head off during your live shot, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=20.8s)]
*  and eventually you said, I've called 911, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=23.28s)]
*  but the water was rising, and you had to do something, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=27.04s)]
*  so pick up the story. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  Steve, I know that we're swamped here [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=33.28s)]
*  with all the 911 calls, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=35.76s)]
*  because there's so many high water rescues [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=37.32s)]
*  that we've already documented so far, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=38.96s)]
*  and called 911, and it was five minutes, 10 minutes, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=40.8s)]
*  and you could hear her screaming, right? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=43.7s)]
*  You could hear it during my live shot, real loud, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  and that's her car right there, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=47.72s)]
*  windshield wipers are still on. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=48.8s)]
*  So I just said, you know what, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=50.36s)]
*  I realize I'm with you guys, I'm on the air, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=51.28s)]
*  but I can't let it go. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=53.16s)]
*  So I just, I dropped everything, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=54.88s)]
*  and I took my wallet out of my pants, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  and I went in there, waited in, about chest deep. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=59.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=63.32s)]
*  That's the type of guy Bob Van Dillon is. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=64.16s)]
*  I've known Bob for probably 15 years. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=65.92s)]
*  So don't be humble, my friend. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=68.94s)]
*  I was not surprised at all when you took off your gear, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=71.16s)]
*  and on live television said, I've gotta go do something. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  Janice, you know how it is, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=79.68s)]
*  and I was concerned at one, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=80.64s)]
*  maybe there was a nice, swift current, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=82.72s)]
*  but the current really wasn't that bad. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=84.38s)]
*  But the water temperature I was afraid with too, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=86.74s)]
*  the water temperature's probably about 80. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=88.46s)]
*  So all those things were working pretty nicely. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=89.97999999999999s)]
*  Now that being said, the water came up to about my chest, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=92.38s)]
*  and she was in there, and she was still strapped [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=94.89999999999999s)]
*  into her car, and the water was actually rising [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=96.94s)]
*  and getting up into the car itself. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=99.02s)]
*  So she was about, you know, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=100.86s)]
*  almost neck deep submerged in her own car. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=102.74s)]
*  If you hadn't done that, if you hadn't gone. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=104.58s)]
*  And she's on her phone with her husband. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=105.41999999999999s)]
*  What would have happened had you not gone in there? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=107.1s)]
*  I mean, she would have drowned. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=110.46s)]
*  Well, it looks like it hasn't gotten that much. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=111.3s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=114.22s)]
*  I told her, okay, undo your seatbelt. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=115.22s)]
*  She undid her seatbelt, and I said, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=117.66000000000001s)]
*  let me have your phone, let me have your bags, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=119.14s)]
*  and then put on my back, and then we walked in. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=120.86s)]
*  So she's short, she's probably about this tall. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  So I put her on my back and just brought in. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  It was, she's fine, she was in shock. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=127.22s)]
*  She was cold, shivering, so I gave her one of my shirts, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=129.58s)]
*  and she was in our car, just warming up. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=132.18s)]
*  About 10 minutes later, the fire department came, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=134.86s)]
*  saw that we were okay, and they went on to the next rescue [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=137.02s)]
*  wherever they were going. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=139.26s)]
*  Me or the first responder? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=140.18s)]
*  But her husband just picked her up about five minutes ago. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=141.02s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=142.74s)]
*  You're amazing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=143.58s)]
*  Yeah, there they are. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=144.4s)]
*  Bob, heroic act, but you know you're never supposed [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=145.24s)]
*  to do any of that stuff. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=149.62s)]
*  Is your wife watching you right now on TV [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=151.10000000000002s)]
*  because you've got a lot of explaining to do? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=153.74s)]
*  You know what, I texted her, I said, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=157.94s)]
*  let's just keep this under wraps. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=159.3s)]
*  She doesn't know what happened or anything. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=160.3s)]
*  I'm gonna text her right now. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  Don't tell her. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=162.94s)]
*  Ali. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=163.78s)]
*  No, Janice, come on, you know it, don't tell him. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=164.62s)]
*  I'm gonna tell him. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=166.46s)]
*  That's good. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=167.3s)]
*  Everyone now knows. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=168.12s)]
*  When I go home, she's eventually, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=169.06s)]
*  she's gonna lose her shoe in my butt when she finds out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=170.62s)]
*  We love you so much, Bob. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=173.94000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for doing such great work. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=175.34s)]
*  That's right, and thanks for actually saving that lady [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  and crossing that police tape that is behind you [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  that means don't cross, but you did it anywhere, anyway, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=182.82000000000002s)]
*  and it was a good deed for the day. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=185.94s)]
*  Thank you, Bob. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=189.46s)]
*  We love you. That's it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  All right, you guys, all right, see you guys later. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=191.78s)]
*  The great Bob Van Dillon. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=194.06s)]
*  He's the best. To the rescue. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=195.78s)]
*  I'm not surprised. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=196.86s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNd-RbzunLA&t=197.86s)]
