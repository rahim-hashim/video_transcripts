# Musk, Zuckerberg, Altman to attend US-Saudi investment forum
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA)
*  Looks like the Saudi crown prince is launching a new AI company Kurt the cyber guy joins us now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=0.0s)]
*  So Kurt a big announcement this morning. What can you tell us about it? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=6.0600000000000005s)]
*  Yeah hours before the president's arrival and good morning to you Lawrence [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=11.06s)]
*  It's called humane AI and a bit of an ironic name for MBS and the Saudi [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=14.48s)]
*  Government this is going to be an AI fund that is being established largely funded out of the existing [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=21.48s)]
*  PIF fund in Saudi and you know Cheryl hit on it. Who's in the room right now? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=27.68s)]
*  You've got metas which is Facebook and Instagram's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=33.32s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg is there and it says a lot who's in these images that we're seeing on the screen [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=37.12s)]
*  Who's in that room another one open AI Sam Altman as you know him from chat GPT [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=42.56s)]
*  He is there and also here mark Zuckerberg's friend Elon Musk Elon Musk in the room of course [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  A lot going on with AI discussions at this forum that's coming up now. What do they want? Why are they there? Well? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=57.08s)]
*  960 billion reasons because the crown prince has one of the largest investment funds on the planet and this investment [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=64.88s)]
*  Fund is ready to go with technology investments from you know AI processing farms to you name it [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=72.84s)]
*  Development in this category is exploding globally and they really want to get their hands into it and they're trying to get their hands on [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=81.26s)]
*  That money and deals made at this conference [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=88.94s)]
*  Thanks to largely the Trump administration putting a focus on [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=92.06s)]
*  Technology and the growth of technology back to the US at this point in time [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=96.9s)]
*  How would that work Kurt they wouldn't be competitors if he has if MBS has started humane this AI company [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=101.38s)]
*  Wouldn't whoever's running chat GPT be a competitor. How would that how would that work? How would our American exactly? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=107.7s)]
*  Investors how would they get access to PIF which is which is the crown prince's company? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=115.30000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I brought the ideal would be that we as Americans and our in our technology American players in the room [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  Ideally would cultivate that investment back to the US so how do we grow in the United States through AI? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=130.26s)]
*  We spend money and we spend money here on our own soil or an ownership of AI elsewhere [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=137.62s)]
*  And then it grows the American economy and it grows us as a keeping us on the forefront of AI [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=144.44s)]
*  While really China is biting at the heels right now to try to advance beyond us [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=150.58s)]
*  Thankfully right now without a lot of regulation. We're able to advance very quickly [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  But the bottom line here is it's about making deals with that sort of you're either gonna be my friend or my enemy [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=160.22s)]
*  You're my competitor or you're going to be you know, no matter what we're gonna dance [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=166.92s)]
*  So do you bring that dance back to the US do you try to carve out? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  What our nation can get out of the growth in AI with the one of the world's largest funds of nine hundred sixty billion dollars [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=174.92s)]
*  You do you get there? So are you are you suggesting that this would be more of a partnership? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=182.92s)]
*  Versus when you look at China [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=189.6s)]
*  We're concerned that they're stealing all the intellectual property when it comes to AI essentially just lifting it and then they say they're making it better [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=191.6s)]
*  Yeah, they are they are exactly doing that China has been famous for stealing a lot of corporate America's intelligence including AI [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=201.42s)]
*  Including a lot of technology advances [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  We had a story we're tracking right now about other communist governments that are coming into the US [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  To just simply steal from us and go develop it on their own [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=216.01999999999998s)]
*  Trying to do it for less money and in this case this really is about [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=219.22s)]
*  What kind of deal can we put together with one of the world's largest investors? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=223.94s)]
*  This is about talking to money bags. So you got money bags and you're in the room [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=229.82000000000002s)]
*  You're going after it to try to cultivate that funding back to America back to our US funds and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=234.46s)]
*  Back to growing technology, which is the forefront of those three major players there [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=241.98000000000002s)]
*  And those are just scratching the surface of the technology players that are there at this conference [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=246.66s)]
*  And if you look back, I mean they weren't there before this was not something that was at the forefront [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=251.26s)]
*  You've got a leader of this country right now going I see something here with technology [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=256.86s)]
*  Let's play ball and that's why you got the party going on that you're looking at on your screen [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=262.06s)]
*  Right quick thing. I think it's important to bring up [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=266.62s)]
*  We need regulation with AI massively quickly and I think believe it or not word is that China also wants it [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=269.24s)]
*  They are concerned about AI getting so powerful their people begin to throw, you know, they could overthrow their government [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=275.58s)]
*  There's all types of things that are unknown that Elon Musk and Sam Altman have warned us about [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=282.26s)]
*  But they're saying now almost like they're doing in college sports. I need the government to come in with some regulation [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=287.82s)]
*  They've introduced some last week. It didn't go over Tristan Harris has talked about that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=293.9s)]
*  But David Sachs is in charge of that. We have an AI czar now. He is there [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=298.46s)]
*  And he is extremely well respected and unbelievably successful [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=303.09999999999997s)]
*  Out in Silicon Valley and just a side note to Saudi Arabia's security [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=306.65999999999997s)]
*  Keeping on Musk and Sam Altman away from each other. They hate each other and they might take swings [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=311.34s)]
*  You're right, but you know what you want to look for here is that I'm sorry go ahead you go ahead [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=320.09999999999997s)]
*  What do we want to look for? I was just gonna say that what we're looking for here is [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=324.65999999999997s)]
*  When you put up a lot of regulation and yeah, you're right Brian we need that we need some kind of [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=329.17999999999995s)]
*  Guardrails on this because yes, the machines will come after us and they'll get us they'll outsmart us [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=334.14s)]
*  They're already outsmarting us now [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=339.97999999999996s)]
*  They just don't have the weapons or the ability physically to get to us just yet, but we're right around the corner [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=341.29999999999995s)]
*  So yeah, we need the guardrails but the same time is there's a balance the more guardrails you put on [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=346.64s)]
*  When others are not putting on those [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=352.14s)]
*  The less kind of innovation you're gonna see it it's such an accelerated moment [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  It's one of those things where either win the game or you don't you're either the player or you're not in the game and the more [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=359.5s)]
*  Regulation you pour into the mix the tougher it is to get anything done [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  So how do you get the whole world to agree to one set of guardrails? Good luck with that? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  It's just a real tough play and one of those things where we might have to just clean up the mess after some advancements [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=377.44s)]
*  I hate to say that but it's probably the reality of where we're going which is just get it done [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=384.4s)]
*  Now let's rein it back in before it kills us, right? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=390.28s)]
*  And we'll talk more about that in all the advancements as we try to keep make the world a better place [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZXT0tnLueA&t=393.06s)]
