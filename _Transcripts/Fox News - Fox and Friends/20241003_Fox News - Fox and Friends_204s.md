# Ainsley Earhardt: I could NOT believe Biden said this.
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg)
*  On the hurricane, Mr. President, why weren't you and Vice President Harris here in Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=0.0s)]
*  commanding this this weekend? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=7.2s)]
*  I was commanding. I was on the phone for at least two hours yesterday and the day before [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  as well. I command. It's called a telephone. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=14.32s)]
*  President Biden was at his beach house, and Vice President Harris was hosting political [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=17.68s)]
*  fundraisers on the West Coast. Is there a reason that they could not be here? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=21.52s)]
*  The president did exactly what a president in this moment needs to do, which is directing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=25.76s)]
*  his team to take action. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=30.96s)]
*  The White House trying to defend Biden's beach trips after Helene hit the southeast here [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=34.56s)]
*  with reaction is Fox News contributor Mark Thiessen. Good morning to you, Mark. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=39.28s)]
*  Good morning. Good morning. I understand a president, you know, needs a vacation day, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=44.92s)]
*  needs to go play golf, needs to go to the beach, whatever. But I feel like every picture [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=48.64s)]
*  now is Joe Biden at the beach. And when there are people in our country, state after state [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=51.92s)]
*  after state, four or five states affected and they're losing their houses, they're losing [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=57.6s)]
*  their loved ones, he can't be on the beach. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=62.28s)]
*  Well, he's going to be able to be on the beach as much as he wants in a couple of months. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=67.16s)]
*  So what's what's the urgency of go to the beach right now? He's in his last last months [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=70.0s)]
*  of his presidency. Look, you've got you've got the worst flaw, the worst storm since [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=74.56s)]
*  Hurricane Katrina. You've got Israel is being attacked by Iran. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=79.0s)]
*  It had never been attacked directly by Iran until Joe Biden was president. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  And now we've got hundreds of missiles raining down on Israeli cities. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=87.28s)]
*  You've got the longshoremen on strike and people are hoarding toilet paper again, having [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=90.72s)]
*  PTSD from their covid lockdowns when we couldn't get basic supplies from the supply chain [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=94.24s)]
*  crisis. And Joe Biden is hanging out on the beach. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  He said he said in that clip, I spent at least two hours on the phone. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  He must be really tuckered out after two hours of phone calls. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=106.72s)]
*  I mean, I could not see he's got multiple crises he's got to be managing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=109.28s)]
*  I could not believe he said that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God came out of his mouth. It was stunning. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=114.52s)]
*  But right. You've got we talked to. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=116.64s)]
*  Yeah, we talked to a couple that he held onto the tree for seven hours and he ended [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=119.52s)]
*  up losing his life. Another couple yesterday was trapped in a drain ditch all day long. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=124.32s)]
*  Oregon's failed, lost his life. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=129.84s)]
*  Houses completely just horrible, eviscerated by mudslides. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=131.92s)]
*  I know. I mean, it's just and I was on the phone for two hours. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=135.48s)]
*  We need more. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  And and not and not just on this, he's got he's got literally where the verge of a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=141.95999999999998s)]
*  massive Israeli Iranian war on the brink of possible war in the Middle East. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  Got wars on two continents on his watch happening. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  And and we've got this strike going on. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  You know, I remember I was in the White House during Hurricane Katrina, and I remember [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  how the left eviscerated President Bush for doing that flyover over over over [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=159.96s)]
*  Hurricane Katrina because he didn't want to divert the first responders. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=165.56s)]
*  So he did a flyover and they used that to show his callousness. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=168.68s)]
*  Can you imagine if they showed a picture of him hanging out on the beach while [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=171.56s)]
*  Hurricane Katrina was happening? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=174.84s)]
*  I mean, the way he would be eviscerated for that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=176.44s)]
*  It's always been that way. You're absolutely right. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=179.0s)]
*  And you know what? Inflation, high prices, you're going to work because you have to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=181.28s)]
*  go to work. We would all love to go to the beach, right? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much. Great to see you, Mark. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=189.76s)]
*  Take care. I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW1FHOgZxg&t=192.51999999999998s)]
