# 'ENCOURAGING NUMBERS': Key swing state's early voting data hints at shocking change
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo)
*  Vice President Harris is heading to Atlanta today for her fifth state visit since announcing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=0.0s)]
*  her candidacy a few months ago. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  This comes ahead of another visit to Georgia with former President Barack Obama next week. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=8.8s)]
*  The swing state is shattering records for early voting turnout. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=14.64s)]
*  There's now well over 800,000 ballots cast after a historic 306,000 were cast on the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=18.76s)]
*  first day of early balloting. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=26.98s)]
*  Here to discuss is former Georgia Congressman Doug Collins. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=29.8s)]
*  Doug, great to see you this morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=33.32s)]
*  So I seem to remember it was just a couple of years ago, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=35.44s)]
*  Democrats were all assuring us that the reforms in Georgia were Jim Crow 2.0. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, it doesn't seem to have worked out that way. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=48.8s)]
*  No, it really hasn't. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=52.64s)]
*  And that's what they've been saying down here for about eight or nine years as we've [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=55.2s)]
*  tightened up our election procedures, going to photo IDs, the things that actually matter. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=58.52s)]
*  And actually what we saw was that the very people they said would not show up were the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=62.32s)]
*  very ones that were showing the increase. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=65.48s)]
*  We saw it in senior adult population. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=66.84s)]
*  We saw it in minority population. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=68.68s)]
*  And by the way, we're now over a million early votes in the first week alone. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=69.68s)]
*  That's almost 20% of the total vote in Georgia has come in in the first week. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=74.92s)]
*  And then the breakdown of that vote has been very encouraging for Republicans as well in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=78.84s)]
*  this week. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=83.76s)]
*  So it's been a good week in Georgia. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=84.76s)]
*  So I'm always very skeptical of polls. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=86.64s)]
*  But one of the latest Wall Street Journal polls have them basically neck and neck. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump 45, Harris 46. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=94.8s)]
*  Where do you think the state of play is right now? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=96.96s)]
*  I think Donald Trump is up in the state of Georgia, probably a couple of three points. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=102.11999999999999s)]
*  The momentum is on his side. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=106.28s)]
*  We're seeing that in the early vote turnout. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=108.28s)]
*  Normally early vote turnout in the state of Georgia will favor the Democrats, typically [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=110.8s)]
*  15, even 20 points in that first week. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  And this week, it's almost even. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=117.2s)]
*  I mean, we're actually Republicans are ahead. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  That's something we've not seen before. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  But there's another aspect to that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=122.53999999999999s)]
*  And we're seeing those low propensity voters, those voters that we can't track because we [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=124.64s)]
*  don't register by party here. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=128.04s)]
*  So you have to look at previous how they voted, what primaries they voted in. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  Look at we've got about 10% of that million number that has come in as these low propensity [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=132.76s)]
*  voters. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't see the excitement for Harris in the state of Georgia. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  I do see it for Donald Trump. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=141.68s)]
*  And we saw this in 2016. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=143.4s)]
*  So there's a long way to go, but there's some very encouraging numbers this first week. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=144.96s)]
*  So obviously, the Harris campaign is bringing out the big guns, bringing Barack Obama to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=149.06s)]
*  the state later this week for their first joint campaign appearance. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=153.4s)]
*  Is that going to make a difference? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=158.28s)]
*  It shows me the desperation and what they have. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=161.24s)]
*  It shows that they're trying to actually go to their base and they're not trying to expand [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=163.28s)]
*  at all. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=167.56s)]
*  I mean, we've seen this with they sent Bill Clinton in last week, and that was a troll [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=168.56s)]
*  train wreck in South Georgia, especially when it came to came to immigration. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=171.72s)]
*  I mean, it just basically he just admitted, yep, the Harris administration had opened [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=176.64s)]
*  the border and Lakin Riley down here was was dead because of it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=181.32s)]
*  So I mean, that was bad. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=184.64s)]
*  So the bringing in Barack Obama or these others is simply trying to get their base up because [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=186.02s)]
*  they see their African-American support is slipping, especially African-American males. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=189.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  A scandal is always when a politician accidentally tells the truth. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  Real quick, we got to go. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=199.56s)]
*  Are you concerned at all about, you know, obviously, Northwest Georgia got hit by Hurricane [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=200.96s)]
*  Helene. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=204.68s)]
*  Are you concerned at all about those areas getting out to vote? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=205.68s)]
*  Yeah, no, the hurricane area in Southeast, we're seeing numbers coming in and people [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=209.2s)]
*  are voting down there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=213.8s)]
*  We were always concerned about turnout, but we're right now we're seeing good things. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=214.8s)]
*  The election boards, local election boards and officials have done a good job. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=218.44s)]
*  Brian Kemp on down have helped make sure that happens. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=221.44s)]
*  I'm looking forward to seeing how that vote comes out. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=224.04s)]
*  Great stuff. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=226.24s)]
*  Thank you, Doug Collins. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=227.24s)]
*  Hey, it's always good to be with you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=228.24s)]
*  I'll take care. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlPRpTp0XSo&t=229.48000000000002s)]
