# Doocy: This surprised a lot of people at the White House
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE)
*  It's an event President Trump is calling Liberation Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=0.0s)]
*  His new tariffs are expected to go into effect tomorrow and he's set to announce the details [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=3.34s)]
*  from the White House Rose Garden. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Madeline Rivera is live at the White House with all the details. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=9.68s)]
*  Hey Maddie. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=13.84s)]
*  Hi guys, good morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=14.84s)]
*  Yeah, there are still some key details that we don't know including how many countries [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=15.84s)]
*  will be affected by type of tariffs, will be imposed, will it be a universal tariff [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=19.34s)]
*  or individual tariff rates for each country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=23.72s)]
*  These are details that we are waiting on. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=26.42s)]
*  State administration officials tell Fox that this is all very fluid and that the president [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=28.72s)]
*  might not make a decision until right before April 2nd or the morning of April 2nd. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=32.28s)]
*  The White House says the tariffs will correct unfair trade practices as they accuse other [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=37.72s)]
*  countries of ripping the U.S. off. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=41.8s)]
*  For the first time in decades, probably since I was a college student, we're going to see [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=45.4s)]
*  fair trade and everyone will have the opportunity to lower their tariffs, lower their non-tariff [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=50.84s)]
*  barriers, stop the currency manipulation, stop subsidizing labor, stop subsidizing, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=59.44s)]
*  stop providing cheap loans. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=66.52s)]
*  The president is also betting tariffs will eventually pay off for the American worker [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=70.8s)]
*  because they say companies will be incentivized to build their products in the U.S. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=74.56s)]
*  I call it a lot of different names but it's really, in a sense, it's a rebirth of a country [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=81.2s)]
*  because how we could have afforded to do what we did, we help everybody and they don't help us. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=85.68s)]
*  I really, the term I like best probably is the liberation of America. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=92.8s)]
*  It's the liberation of this country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=96.88s)]
*  And the president is meeting with trade advisors. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=100.56s)]
*  They're supposed to hand him a series of high-level trade reports today which could influence [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=102.88s)]
*  his decision. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=107.6s)]
*  Lauren, Steve Ainsley and Brian. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=108.6s)]
*  All right, Matty, thank you very much. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=110.32s)]
*  It's hard to imagine a pause on all this, on Liberation Day. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  Well, what surprised a lot of people who apparently work at the White House, some of the advisors, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=115.52s)]
*  was yesterday when the president said that he had settled on a plan because it sounded [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  like he had not settled on a plan before and wanted more information. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  Ultimately, we're going to find out what's going on but we do know if it is that reciprocal [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  thing or a universal, those are the two choices that Matty just detailed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=132.76s)]
*  Apparently, according to the Wall Street Journal, a number of nations, different countries, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=138.56s)]
*  have actually called the White House ahead of time and said, hey listen, if it's going [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  to be reciprocal, can we make a deal before you announce out loud what the deal is? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=145.72s)]
*  Think about how great that would look. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=152.88s)]
*  If he says, you know, guys, I have a, when he goes to do his roundup at the end of the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=154.28s)]
*  day, I got a few announcements. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=158.16s)]
*  India called, we're going to drop the tariffs. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, great. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=161.44s)]
*  The EU called, we did this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=162.44s)]
*  That's the whole point. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=163.44s)]
*  We'll come together with Vietnam on certain, so this would be it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=164.44s)]
*  It should be like Jerry Maguire, working the phones, working on all these deals. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=167.16s)]
*  Please don't laugh, Carly, I'm in the middle of talking to you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=172.08s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=174.72s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=175.72s)]
*  This is unbelievable that she interrupt me like that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=176.72s)]
*  And I would love to see, I know the car companies are getting really nervous because a lot of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=179.0s)]
*  their, a lot of these automobile companies, even if they build it here, they don't get [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=183.96s)]
*  all the parts here. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=187.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=188.68s)]
*  So they've got to deal with other countries and if those parts go up, how do you not charge [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=189.68s)]
*  the people and you can't immediately get all these parts done. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  You can't get leather seats, for example. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=196.36s)]
*  If we don't have a place that makes leather seats at a way that's somewhat affordable [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=197.84s)]
*  for an explorer, let's say, then how do you do that on a dime? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=201.88000000000002s)]
*  What you do is you pay more on the tariff and then you've got to turn around and charge [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=206.0s)]
*  the people more and that would be the issue. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=210.52s)]
*  Remember two weeks ago we showed that graph of the most American-made cars. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  The most was Tesla and they do have an affordable one. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=216.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  Solid part of the negotiation. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, ultimately though, there's a lot of uncertainty. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  Today's April 1st. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=225.6s)]
*  We closed out the first quarter since 2022 where the stock market finished down, which [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=227.27999999999997s)]
*  is not a good thing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=235.0s)]
*  I spent the weekend down in Florida. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=236.11999999999998s)]
*  There are a lot of people who are retirees who live on a fixed income and they've got [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=238.11999999999998s)]
*  a nest egg and they've looked at their 401k and it has gone down. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=241.44s)]
*  So they have their fingers crossed that this gigantic experiment is going to work. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  Although we have heard from the president, he said it's going to be a short-term pain. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=250.64s)]
*  Question is, how long is it going to hurt? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=254.08s)]
*  Try and bring manufacturing back to America so we can charge of our own destiny. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U4Du8PK-KE&t=255.52s)]
