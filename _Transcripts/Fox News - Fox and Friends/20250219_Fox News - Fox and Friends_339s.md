# 'THEY'RE GUILTY': Elon Musk fires back at left-wing attacks
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU)
*  President Trump and Elon Musk opening up about their working relationship as Democrats try to turn them against each other. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon called me, he said, you know they're trying to drive us apart. I said absolutely. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=8.0s)]
*  I wanted somebody really smart to work with me in terms of the country. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=12.0s)]
*  When these attacks occur, the thing that they're accusing the administration of is what they are guilty of. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=17.0s)]
*  They're saying that things are being done unconstitutional, but what they are doing is unconstitutional. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=23.0s)]
*  They are guilty of the crime of which they accuse us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=29.0s)]
*  Co-anchor of America's Newsroom and co-host of The Five, Dana Perini joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=33.0s)]
*  Hey Dana, did you watch the interview last night? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=38.0s)]
*  I did. I watched it this morning because my nights are pretty early. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=40.0s)]
*  So I think it's interesting when they've been talking about people trying to get between somebody, right? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=45.0s)]
*  You see this in celebrity relationships, you might even see it in your own relationships. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=50.0s)]
*  You might have seen it in high school because life continues like high school. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=54.0s)]
*  What I saw is that their relationship is genuine and there's tremendous respect between the two of them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=58.0s)]
*  And also I've always said a president needs somebody who's going to be their assassin. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=63.0s)]
*  Now that's not how Elon Musk described it. He said, I am tech support for President Trump's executive orders. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=68.0s)]
*  And I thought, wow, I need tech support from Elon Musk. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=75.0s)]
*  How do you do this on my phone? I can't figure it out. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=77.0s)]
*  I don't think they will be, anybody, the left will be successful in driving a wedge between the two. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=80.0s)]
*  When you have mutual respect with somebody, nothing's going to come between that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=87.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=92.0s)]
*  Only you can screw that up. And that could happen, of course. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=93.0s)]
*  But right now I think that they're a little bit on a roll. People are enjoying it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=96.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean that everything's perfect. And even Elon Musk said, I'm going to make mistakes. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=100.0s)]
*  But President Trump has given him a lot of room to run and get things done. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=104.0s)]
*  And I think Trump respects the fact that there are results. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=108.0s)]
*  I thought it really humanized both of them. I thought they had some fun moments. They were laughing with each other. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=111.0s)]
*  I thought it was very conversational. But they also were exposing the left. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=116.0s)]
*  You know, the left has run on this, cutting out the waste, saving Americans money, and they never do it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=120.0s)]
*  And now Donald Trump's coming in and he's opening up the books. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=125.0s)]
*  And we're seeing exactly how we have our tax dollars. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=129.0s)]
*  The average American makes $66,000. They pay taxes and their money is being wasted. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=132.0s)]
*  Right. I think about what Lee Zeldin, who is now the EPA administrator, found, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=138.0s)]
*  where you had billions of dollars going to so many climate projects and not getting any results. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=142.0s)]
*  And one of them is connected to a free Palestine. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=150.0s)]
*  Now, you might say that's a worthwhile program, but you can't answer the follow-up question. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=153.0s)]
*  Is that something that federal taxpayer dollars should be going for? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=158.0s)]
*  And I think that the American people are saying, obviously no. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=161.0s)]
*  Yep, they get it. You have a new book coming out. And you're in it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=164.0s)]
*  Well, thank you. You interview a lot of people here at Fox asking advice. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=169.0s)]
*  And this is the number one question we always get. So I thought this was genius of you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=173.0s)]
*  Because college kids, adults even, will say to us, tell us what your day's like. What advice do you have? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=177.0s)]
*  Not only that, but they also want to know how do you move from one job to the next? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=183.0s)]
*  Or what if you are working in finance but you think you want to go into politics? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=186.0s)]
*  Or how do you make a perfect work-life balance? A perfect doesn't exist. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=190.0s)]
*  I interviewed a lot of people here and then also my friend Dirk Spentley in Nashville. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=196.0s)]
*  He participated in Mike Rowe, Selena Zito, my college roommate to answer all of these questions. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=200.0s)]
*  And so I feel like it's fresh, convenient, efficient, all of those questions all in one place and not just for young women. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=206.0s)]
*  It's called I Wish Someone Had Told Me. How do you answer that? What do you wish someone had told you? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=212.0s)]
*  Well, that title came from my mom when she read Everything Will Be Okay, which was really about young women and their quarter-life crisis. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=217.0s)]
*  She said, wow, I wish somebody had told me this. Oh, really? Right. So I took that and said, well, maybe we could do that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=223.0s)]
*  And then we have a little game to play. Okay. So I'm going to read a quote. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=229.0s)]
*  All four Fox & Friends anchors participated. Okay. Here's one of the answers. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=233.0s)]
*  You must learn from mistakes because hustle is not enough. You must be good enough to be successful. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=239.0s)]
*  And the game is which one of the four of you said that? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=246.0s)]
*  Hustle is not enough. You must be good enough to be successful. Right. Is it Steve? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=252.0s)]
*  It was Brian Kilmer. Brian. Brian Kilmer. Well, he does hustle. He does hustle. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=256.0s)]
*  He's got a very interesting start to his career. And that's the other thing that I really like about this is that you have the idea of how did you even know what you wanted to do? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=261.0s)]
*  Trey Gowdy is in the book quite a bit and he talks about that decision making process of deciding what you want to do and then also knowing when to leave a job. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=270.0s)]
*  That was also something because when he left Congress, he talks about waking up every day and feeling like this is not my purpose. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=278.0s)]
*  And if you feel that way, then you have to make a plan to leave. And I interview my friend Michelle Chase. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=288.0s)]
*  She's over at Omnicom and she says she's an HR and she talks about how many weeks you need to give a notice. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=293.0s)]
*  Should you leave a job without having a job before? So all of those types of things. Great advice. Great advice. I'm very excited for it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=299.0s)]
*  This comes out in April, but you can pre-order it now. So go on Amazon or wherever you buy your books. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=303.0s)]
*  Yeah, at FoxNewsBooks.com. You can pre-order it there too. Oh, Fox News Books. There you go. Congratulations. Thanks. Thanks so much. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=308.0s)]
*  And look how beautiful you are. Oh, I thank you. She has the best hair of anyone at Fox. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=313.0s)]
*  I know. I'm kind of similar. And then coming up on Newsroom, we have Tim Scott, Trey Gowdy, Ro Khanna, and of course Bill Hammer, everybody's favorite. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=317.0s)]
*  He's in the book too. We'll be watching. Thank you. Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you so much. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=324.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYtijMsGrU&t=329.0s)]
