# Iranian threat rises to 'extreme danger' ahead of Trump admin talks
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ)
*  27 minutes after the hour, let's change gears. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  A shocking new report from the Institute for Science and International Security warns the [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=2.16s)]
*  current threat from Iran has risen to extreme danger. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=6.68s)]
*  And it comes a day before the Trump administration holds direct talks with their adversary for [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=10.0s)]
*  the last 40 years. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=15.76s)]
*  The warning explains, quote, major negative factors include Iran's greater nuclear weapons [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=17.0s)]
*  capabilities. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=21.44s)]
*  It's a shorter timeframe to build nuclear weapons and the growing normalization of internal [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=22.48s)]
*  Iranian discussions favoring building nuclear weapons. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=27.44s)]
*  In fact, in one month they're going to have 10, in two months they're going to have 12 [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=30.92s)]
*  to 13, in three months 15 weapons. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=33.84s)]
*  Let's bring in retired four-star general, Fox News senior strategic analyst, chairman [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  of the Institute for Study of War, General Jack Keane. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  General, does this study change your perspective on the timeframe Iran needs to build their [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=44.0s)]
*  nuclear weapon? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=49.64s)]
*  No, I don't think we're surprised by the study. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=50.64s)]
*  The reality is, and certainly the administration has classified information that certainly [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=56.12s)]
*  would complement that study if not go further with it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=62.64s)]
*  So they have the facts. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=65.16s)]
*  But let's face it, what's happening here? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=66.8s)]
*  Iran has become somewhat defenseless. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=69.52s)]
*  No longer do they have Hezbollah and Hamas to the degree they did. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=72.28s)]
*  They don't have Syria as their strategic platform. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  Their air defense systems have been destroyed by Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=78.6s)]
*  Much of their rockets and missiles destroyed by Israel as well. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=81.5s)]
*  And Iran has been deterred. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=84.96s)]
*  They have not reattacked even though they promised they would. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=86.8s)]
*  So they're in a very difficult situation to say the least. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=90.44s)]
*  And that brings up the way they want to preserve their regime. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  The reason they've always wanted that weapon is for that reason. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=98.6s)]
*  And now they need it more than ever. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=102.56s)]
*  So we shouldn't be surprised that they're moving closer to it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=104.63999999999999s)]
*  But going into these negotiations, Brian, we couldn't be further apart. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=109.6s)]
*  The president has issued an ultimatum to the supreme leader. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=114.3s)]
*  Dis-voluntarily dismaying your program through negotiations. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  Let's do inspections anywhere, anytime to verify that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=122.66s)]
*  And let's do it by a date certain. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=126.02s)]
*  They're not even going to admit in these negotiations that they have a nuclear weapons program. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=128.3s)]
*  And they're going to want to preserve that program as much as possible. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=133.96s)]
*  They're masters at this negotiation stuff. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=138.46s)]
*  Two years prior to that lousy nuclear deal in 2015, they participated in these negotiations. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=141.6s)]
*  One of the objectives the Iranians are going to have here is much like what the Russians [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  are doing over Ukraine, is to delay, delay, delay and stall and buy time for their weapons [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=152.56s)]
*  development program. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=159.92s)]
*  So that's a father complete. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=161.45999999999998s)]
*  They already have the weapons. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=163.45999999999998s)]
*  And then we have to deal with them like we would deal with North Korea. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=165.28s)]
*  General, there's no way that Benjamin Netanyahu rushed over here to worry about a trade deal [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  with the U.S. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=173.6s)]
*  You know all this thing from getting the hostages out to what's happening in Gaza and Iran. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  You know what Israel did to the Iraq in 1980, took it out. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  You know they took out Syria's nuclear program themselves, even though they wanted George [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  W. Bush to do it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=187.89999999999998s)]
*  You know they're not going to sit on the sidelines here. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=189.42s)]
*  So there is a clock. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  There's a clock ticking on Iran this time. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=193.76s)]
*  We should use that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  Steve Witkoff should use that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=197.8s)]
*  Yeah, there's no doubt about it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=201.4s)]
*  We have a huge amount of leverage here because of the position that Iran is in that I just [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  mentioned. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=208.28s)]
*  The only thing that is helping Iran right now is China is going full blast to bail Iran [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=209.28s)]
*  out. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  From February to March, they increased oil purchases from Iran 80 percent. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  So now 90 percent of Iran's oil exports are being bought by China. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=224.36s)]
*  And that is to keep the Iran economy afloat despite the sanctions that the Trump administration [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  is imposing on them. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  That is the one lever that they have and certainly China and the tariff war with the United States [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  is not going to resolve that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  They're going to continue to get Chinese money buying their oil in the future. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=247.88000000000002s)]
*  But nonetheless, we still go into these talks with huge amount of leverage to get what [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=253.08s)]
*  we want out of it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=258.68s)]
*  And you're absolutely right. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=259.68s)]
*  The clock is ticking here. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  And I think not just for Prime Minister Netanyahu, but also for President Trump. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=262.98s)]
*  He has issued an ultimatum. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=267.88s)]
*  He wants it by a date certain. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=269.8s)]
*  He's not going to wait forever. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  That's the reality of it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=273.72s)]
*  And I believe Witkoff and company certainly have to have the ability to look people in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=275.40000000000003s)]
*  the eye and convince them of that reality. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=280.52s)]
*  And we have an aircraft carrier in the region. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=284.35999999999996s)]
*  We have the bombs to go through those bunkers and tear up that nuclear program. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=286.28s)]
*  The question is, do we do it or do they do it? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=291.24s)]
*  And if they give us, if they're not cooperatives on Saturday, that'll make the president's [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  decision a lot a lot easier. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=297.56s)]
*  General, thanks so much. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_if-hhuZUQ&t=299.59999999999997s)]
