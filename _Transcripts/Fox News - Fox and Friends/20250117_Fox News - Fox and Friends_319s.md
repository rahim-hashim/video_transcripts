# Bombshell report details how Schumer pushed Biden out
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM)
*  All right now from Capitol Hill to the White House after Joe Biden gave his final interview as president last night over on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=0.0s)]
*  MSNBC senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey joins us now. Hey Peter [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=8.1s)]
*  Good morning. And the thing that people loved about Joe Biden forever is that he was kind of an open book [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=12.5s)]
*  He always joked that he would get in trouble because he says what he means and he means what he says [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=17.86s)]
*  But he has had nothing to say about Nancy Pelosi's role in squeezing him out a big part of the reason that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=22.22s)]
*  He was removed from the ticket. Of course, it doesn't help when the exit interview on MSNBC last night [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  Doesn't ask him about her [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=35.56s)]
*  But we do have a brand new window in the last hour or so into the way Chuck Schumer [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=37.28s)]
*  Helped get rid of Biden just published in the New York Times about a meeting this summer in Rehoboth, Delaware [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Schumer said if there's a secret ballot in the Senate, mr. President Schumer said my guess is you get at most five [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=48.36s)]
*  Yeses really mr. Biden responded I know my caucus. Mr. Schumer told him, you know [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=55.86s)]
*  I know my caucus and mr [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=61.36s)]
*  Biden nodded despite the fact that Democrats then elevated someone who never got a primary vote to the top of the ticket [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=63.22s)]
*  The president says the real threat to democracy is in the future. I [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=69.6s)]
*  Really am concerned about [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=75.38s)]
*  How fragile democracy is I guess what I'm worried about is that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=79.82s)]
*  The thing that keeps it on track are the guardrails [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=83.48s)]
*  that's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=90.28s)]
*  This there's a Supreme Court that's independent but [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=91.92s)]
*  Not but accountable [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=96.72s)]
*  There was a Congress that you speak your mind, but you held accountable to basic standards [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=99.0s)]
*  There's a presidency that says you have really limited powers. I mean [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  The top dog but you're not you can't [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=110.58s)]
*  Dictate everything and I don't know they seem to just we just seem to be chipping away at all those elements [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=113.86s)]
*  Later on this afternoon. President Biden is gonna deliver remarks to the Conference of Mayors here in Washington that he's got a trip listed to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=121.7s)]
*  Joint pace Andrews, even though he's not flying anywhere. So he is either going to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=129.42s)]
*  Thank the Air Force one and Marine one crews or maybe welcome a special guest we haven't been told yet back to you [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  It's interesting stuff Peter. I've got a quick question for you. You know, that was his last interview [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=139.88000000000002s)]
*  Nobody over the last four years has gotten Joe Biden to say more about stuff [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=144.44s)]
*  He didn't want to say then you did, you know, you were constantly [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=149.24s)]
*  Barking questions at him and most famously you you yelled at him about inflation and he called you a stupid sob [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  Since this is your last Friday at the Biden White House, I [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=160.94s)]
*  Know we can tell the story now [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=164.94s)]
*  He actually called you when you were live on special report with Brett Baer and he told you something that nobody knows [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=167.26s)]
*  He did I feel like I can say this now because it never happened. He called me and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=175.46s)]
*  Initially, he told me it's nothing personal pal [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=182.22s)]
*  But he said a bad word and he also said and this was at the tail end of kovat [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=185.12s)]
*  He said he would have me in for lunch when it was safe. Well, I think [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=190.28s)]
*  His lunch card is probably filled. It never happened. So it was never safe to have lunch with me [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=195.48s)]
*  Yeah, no kid. So and when Jen Psaki left a couple of years ago on the way out when you famously took a picture with her [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=202.76s)]
*  You asked her now he's gonna remember about the lunch, right? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=211.04s)]
*  The lunch never happened [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  I've told many people about the lunch the lunch never happened. I did not pack a lunch today Fridays [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm usually out of leftovers. So we're out here [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=224.16s)]
*  So in other words if somebody from the White House is watching right now, you are available to have lunch with the president. I [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=227.12s)]
*  Don't know how many TVs are still turned on in there [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=233.8s)]
*  It seems like people don't want to watch the coverage of what's happening [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=236.6s)]
*  in fact, I was walking through the press area and a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  Lot of the picture frames are empty now [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=242.7s)]
*  I don't know if this is people from the press who are just taking pictures off the wall or the Biden people are going [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=245.38s)]
*  To take pictures of the president, but there are empty picture frames. I think a lot of turned off TVs inside right now [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=250.14s)]
*  Sorry, thank you for revealing that big secret. He promised you lunch and he never did it and he called us broken [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=255.9s)]
*  What was the pony soldier? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=264.94s)]
*  That was before he was president. He said I was a one-horse pony [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  And you know what? I will always try I don't know [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=271.04s)]
*  I have not covered the Trump White House much but covered him over the last 10 years or so [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=274.0s)]
*  Very interested to see what kind of creative nicknames he could possibly come up [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=280.8s)]
*  Well, if Donald Trump right now, he's got a whole plane ride to think right and Peter if he if Donald Trump invited you to lunch [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=285.58s)]
*  You would have lunch just saying [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=291.16s)]
*  Hey, mr. President, I'll be here on Monday [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=294.52s)]
*  So if Obama and Bush and Clinton are gonna skip your inaugural lunch, I'm I'm free [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=297.08s)]
*  All right. All right. Thanks. Always looking to thank you. I'm Steve. Doocy. I'm Brian kill me [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amclsJ3ocdM&t=305.0s)]
