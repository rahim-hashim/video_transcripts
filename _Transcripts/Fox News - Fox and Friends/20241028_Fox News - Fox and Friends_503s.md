# GOP early voting surpasses Dems in key swing states
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg)
*  And the lineup was first it was Mike Johnson, then it was Vivek, then it was Tulsi, then it was RFK Jr., Hulk, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=0.0s)]
*  Dr. Phil, Dana White, JD Vance, Elon Musk, Melania, and Donald Trump. What a lineup. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=6.4s)]
*  I know. There were people before that. And by the way, Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz, two [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=11.52s)]
*  people that Oprah gave huge breaks to and very successful shows, and both said you can have them, I'm staying here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=18.64s)]
*  I was shocked to see Dr. Phil there. Even though you get the sense, you know where Dr. Phil stands. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  That's a major thing because he starts his own network, interviewed Trump twice. Same thing with [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=29.92s)]
*  Dave Ramsey. Dave Ramsey is usually apolitical, you know where he stands conservatively financially. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=35.2s)]
*  After he interviews Trump, he's like, I am in. So I think that's pretty significant. If we could just go [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=40.24s)]
*  back one second and put up that full screen. And Joe Rogan, how about Joe Rogan? He hasn't endorsed [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  it, right? Didn't Trump say in the interview? No, I don't think he will. And he says, I want to sit down with Kamala Harris, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=48.24s)]
*  but I listened to the whole thing. They really had a great conversation, mutual respect there. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=52.0s)]
*  But he said, Dana White is the reason you're here, and when you got shot, you just sold me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=57.12s)]
*  I thought it was important. He said, I never would have voted for Biden. I was giving her a shot. I'd [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=61.76s)]
*  like to have a conversation with her. That Wall Street Journal list, submissive list, rhetoric aside, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=66.16s)]
*  I think this is important. This is what she stands for, and this is what Andy Cusler wrote about today. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=71.6s)]
*  Forget about your opinion, male, female, Republican or Democrat. No one's talking about that anymore. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=76.08s)]
*  Price controls, she mentioned it. Price gouging, it doesn't exist. The tax rate, you might not like [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=82.08s)]
*  rich people, but they buy a lot of businesses, they grow a lot of businesses. Give them that 2% back, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=88.32s)]
*  that'll give them more money into the system. Heavier regulation, they came cascading down, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=94.16s)]
*  ask anyone in oil and gas. Federal housing controls, the reason why you buy a house, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=98.8s)]
*  there's all these environmental and all these other issues. They stopped building for four years, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  and this is what we get. Now, Trump is not perfect, but you know he's going to go on to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=107.92s)]
*  anti-regulation. He's going to try to get as less tax as possible because he believes the more money [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=112.48s)]
*  you give people to keep, he believes the growth is going to get there. He's going to cut your- [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=117.44s)]
*  The border's K-2. The border's huge crimes, huge energy bills. He's going to decrease them 50% [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=122.56s)]
*  within the first year, he says. And you saw the energy there in the stadium yesterday, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=128.0s)]
*  but that energy is nothing if people don't show up to the polls. Right. And I think the former [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=133.04s)]
*  president, Elon Musk, made it very clear. This is something different from the last time. You [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=137.12s)]
*  got to vote early, you got to make it too big to rig. Here's the former president. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=141.44s)]
*  Early voting is underway in every swing state, and we are setting all-time records. They're [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=147.04s)]
*  voting, I tell you what. I don't want to talk about it, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=152.16s)]
*  but we have to keep it going. You got to get out and vote. We just have to get out. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=159.68s)]
*  And who would have thought this was going to happen? We're leading in every swing state, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=164.0s)]
*  but it doesn't mean a thing. Vote early, vote now. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=186.32s)]
*  Make the margin of victory so big that you-know-what can't happen. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  Massive overwhelming sweep of every swing state, and even some of the states that aren't, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=196.48s)]
*  people don't think they're swing states. Massive crushing victory. Get every swing state to vote [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=205.44s)]
*  early. And we're leading in every swing state, and we're setting all-time records. We got to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=213.68s)]
*  win every swing state. Massive crushing victory. Get everyone, friends, family, people on the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=220.8s)]
*  street. Put the signs up, put the hat on. You guys, Democrats, you did that. By vilifying him [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  when he bought X, by trying to sue him with his space program and take him down when it comes to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=233.84s)]
*  Tesla, leaving him out of all green conversations, you forced him to go to Trump. Going after his [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=238.8s)]
*  kid too. You made a huge mistake because he's got a huge ground game too. Look at that graphic [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  right there. That's unbelievable. We're not surprised by the Democrats because they normally [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=248.48s)]
*  vote early. But look at the Republican number. It's almost up there with the Democrats. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=252.48s)]
*  It's surging. And so let's go ahead and look state by state at how it's breaking down, Ainsley. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=256.24s)]
*  All right. So let's start with Arizona. It looks like 35% are Democrats who have already voted. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=261.68s)]
*  42% Republican. Why is that? Well, what's interesting is that does not-35 and 42 does [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=268.24s)]
*  not add up to 100%. That's because 23% of the people who requested votes are [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=274.48s)]
*  independents or third parties. So while that number is really good for Republicans, keep in mind [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=284.48s)]
*  there's 23% independents who also are out there that could swing the election. When you look at [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  Georgia, it said 2.7 million early votes. You mean Jim Crow 2.0? Are you sure no one passed out from [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=295.36s)]
*  not getting water? I mean, has anyone lost consciousness? I haven't received their report. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=303.84s)]
*  Okay. I'm going to look into that. And in Michigan, it's at 1.6 million as well. So now in Nevada, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=309.67999999999995s)]
*  look at that number. Republicans have returned 40% of the Republicans who requested-of all the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=317.2s)]
*  early votes, 40% are Republican, 35% are Democrat. Why is that? Is that because he was the first to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  say no tax on tips? Well, I don't know. But keep in mind- It's a good question. Keep in mind. I [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=329.84s)]
*  think a lot of people just have heard so many times that 2020 their vote was stolen and so they're [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=335.76s)]
*  trying to get it in, regardless. But you also have to keep in mind that in Nevada, 25% are not-you [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=340.32s)]
*  know, they are not third party essentially. I don't think, Steve, I've ever voted early and I'm going [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=346.23999999999995s)]
*  to vote early. You can start now. I always vote. I tried twice over the weekend. The line was three [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=350.08s)]
*  hours long. One time I started at 8.45 in the morning, I drove by Sunday. Really? I asked the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=354.72s)]
*  guy at the end, he goes, I asked the guys who came out, how long did it take? Three hours. Okay, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=360.16s)]
*  I'll just go Sunday. No one's going to go on Sunday. Wait, do you- Packed again three hours. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  And does it depend on the state? Because I know in some states, you have to call and advance and [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=366.88000000000005s)]
*  find out where you go because it's not where you normally would go. Yeah, it's true. Early voting [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=370.64000000000004s)]
*  is often different than the day of election day. And you look at North Carolina, despite all the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=374.48s)]
*  storms and everything that's there, 33% Democrat, 34% Republican, totaling up to 2.7. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=379.68s)]
*  But that's a huge number. The thing about North Carolina, Lawrence, is there are more independents [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=389.68s)]
*  in North Carolina than Democrats or Republicans. What about Pennsylvania, Steve? What's going on [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=395.44s)]
*  there? Well, in Pennsylvania, 1.4 million third party people in that state. So while Democrats [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=399.52s)]
*  are 60% and Republicans are 30, how is that final 1.4 million going to vote in Pennsylvania? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=406.96s)]
*  Our point is swing state early voting looks really good for Republicans and surging over [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=416.88s)]
*  historical levels. And we don't know exactly why that is. We just know that there are also so many [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=423.44s)]
*  independents in each of these states while they look encouraging in a couple of states. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=429.76s)]
*  Gotta keep in mind, how are the independents voting? I will say the last time, just for my, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=434.32s)]
*  you know, take it with a grain of salt if you want to, when I'm talking with friends and family, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=439.04s)]
*  last election, people were much more relaxed when it came down to vote. Oh yeah, I'm gonna show them. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  Now it seems like it's a massive appeal. Okay, I got my vote in, bringing people to the polls. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=449.76s)]
*  It just seems way different every corner. It's true. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  Drive-through voting? How do we ever accept that? Hi honey, pass your ballots up front. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=460.08s)]
*  That's funny. But it was a global pandemic and people were afraid to be around everybody. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=472.64s)]
*  The pandemic. So many people just dropped it off or mailed it in. And so it looks like this is a [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=478.08s)]
*  new trend for America, which is good because, Brian, that way you don't have to wait in line [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=484.96s)]
*  three hours. That's true. All right, so let's see what happens. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXKW_4zdrIg&t=488.96s)]
