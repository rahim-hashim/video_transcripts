# Trump teases 'very big' announcement: 'As big as it gets'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ)
*  All right, it's three minutes after the top of the hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Top U.S. officials are expected to meet with their Chinese counterparts in Switzerland [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=2.24s)]
*  this weekend. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=6.18s)]
*  This is big news for the first set of trade talks since President Trump's tariffs went [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=7.18s)]
*  into effect. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=11.82s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Peter Deucey joins us with more details. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=12.82s)]
*  Good morning, Peter. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=16.1s)]
*  Hey, Peter. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=17.1s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=18.1s)]
*  And officials here at the White House were able to get their Chinese counterparts to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=19.1s)]
*  the table to talk about these tariffs without relaxing any of them, which was the plan for [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=21.86s)]
*  the last couple of weeks. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=27.1s)]
*  So at least trade-wise, this is going to be the biggest weekend since Liberation Day. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=28.66s)]
*  What we're going to do in Switzerland is we've agreed to talk. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=36.0s)]
*  Then, on Saturday and Sunday, we will agree what we're going to talk about. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=39.620000000000005s)]
*  My sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal, but we've got [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=43.72s)]
*  to de-escalate before we can move forward. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=52.06s)]
*  And the intrigue grows ahead of a Trump trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=55.58s)]
*  Emirates next week, because we know the president wouldn't go all that way without a belief [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=60.98s)]
*  that he could make a big splash on the world stage. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=65.9s)]
*  And he claims that is exactly what is about to happen. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=68.53999999999999s)]
*  We're going to have a very, very big announcement to make. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=73.1s)]
*  Like, as big as it gets, it is really, really positive. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=76.1s)]
*  And that announcement will be made either Thursday or Friday or Monday before we leave. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=81.5s)]
*  But it will be one of the most important announcements that have been made in many years about a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=87.1s)]
*  certain subject. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=92.66s)]
*  So a certain subject. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=94.9s)]
*  It might not have to do with trade. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=96.34s)]
*  We know that Saudi Arabia, the first stop on his trip, was originally where he hoped [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=97.88s)]
*  to talk about the Ukraine war with Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=101.7s)]
*  But that appears to have fizzled out because it's not on any of the schedules that we've [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=104.82s)]
*  seen for next week. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  So a big announcement tomorrow or Friday. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=109.97999999999999s)]
*  Stay tuned. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=113.46s)]
*  It might be something for Brian's birthday. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=114.69999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=116.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=117.5s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=118.5s)]
*  He could be waiting. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=119.5s)]
*  Peter, am I right? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=120.5s)]
*  Did he say Middle East, though? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=121.5s)]
*  Was it something in the Middle East? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=122.66s)]
*  Did I mis- did I interpret that correctly? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=123.66s)]
*  Or could it be anything? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  No, it is classic Trump. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=126.89999999999999s)]
*  He is building suspense. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=129.42s)]
*  So yesterday, just kind of dangle something out there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  We will talk about it all day today now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=134.7s)]
*  And then tomorrow he can do the big reveal. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=137.26s)]
*  And he did rename the Persian Gulf the Gulf of Arabia. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=139.46s)]
*  We don't want to give it to Iran? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=143.7s)]
*  I mean, is taking it from Iran? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=145.1s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=147.94s)]
*  If it is something like that, a renaming, we know that renaming the Gulf of Mexico, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=149.98s)]
*  Gulf of America, is one of his favorite accomplishments of the Persian 100. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=155.06s)]
*  He still keeps the Gulf of America map next to the desk so that the news outlets that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=159.1s)]
*  don't want to say Gulf of America have to include it in all of their video and their [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=163.94s)]
*  photos. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=168.1s)]
*  So it could be. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=169.1s)]
*  What do you think it is? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=170.1s)]
*  Any rumblings that maybe a deal with India, maybe something with Iran? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=171.42s)]
*  I mean, if I was going to if I had a crystal ball because he said that it was one of the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=176.22s)]
*  most important announcements in many years about a certain subject, it would seem like [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=179.94s)]
*  he's talking about something that's been going on for a long time. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=184.74s)]
*  So either Ukraine or the Israel Hamas war. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=187.26s)]
*  But there's just no way to know with him. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  It really could be anything. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=195.74s)]
*  Well, he said the Houthi rebels are tired of fighting. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=198.06s)]
*  So I guess we already announced that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=200.54s)]
*  So I don't know if that counts. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=202.34s)]
*  No, it wouldn't count. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=203.78s)]
*  Always trying to predict the president. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=205.18s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=206.98s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=207.98s)]
*  I do think it's interesting. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=208.98s)]
*  And Brian, you noted this when we were starting that China has caved. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=210.54s)]
*  Looks like the people protesting in China. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=214.9s)]
*  President Trump has to be one of the most lucky individuals. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=219.82s)]
*  He continued to say, hey, just be cool. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=221.62s)]
*  They're going to be forced to come to the negotiating table. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=223.66s)]
*  And it looks like it's about to happen. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=226.78s)]
*  Yeah, well, we are taxing Chinese imports, one hundred and forty five percent, those [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=228.06s)]
*  tariffs, and then China hit us back with one hundred and twenty five percent tariffs. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=232.42s)]
*  Now, this is the first time that we've had an interaction with China since the inauguration. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=237.7s)]
*  Remember, they sent the Chinese vice president to the inauguration. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=242.3s)]
*  This is the first time the two countries have sat down together. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=245.42000000000002s)]
*  So it is big news. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=248.14s)]
*  You heard Scott Bessett say first, they think this will be about de-escalation and global [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=249.18s)]
*  trade experts told the BBC that they expect the negotiations to take several months. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=254.18s)]
*  So Radio Free Asia says that hundreds of employees have taken to the streets in China to demand [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=258.58s)]
*  better pay and challenge the layoffs that they're forced to digest after the shutdown [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=265.38s)]
*  of Chinese factories because of the manufacturing has slowed down to that degree heavily anyway [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=270.9s)]
*  between twenty three and twenty five. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=276.54s)]
*  They also Goldman Sachs of China, an economist said, Goldman Sachs says they estimate that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=278.82s)]
*  sixteen million jobs are involved in producing goods sold to the U.S. and prices will need [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=283.54s)]
*  to fall for domestic and other foreign policy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=288.94s)]
*  So one of the things they're saying is China has to consume more. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=291.9s)]
*  But China's going, we're not consuming more because you're not paying me enough. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=294.86s)]
*  And number two is we have terrible retirement benefits, one hundred and sixty dollars a [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=298.1s)]
*  month. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=301.98s)]
*  So you want us to live on that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=302.98s)]
*  We have to save our money because you're not paying us anything. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=303.98s)]
*  So their Medicare with their version of Medicare is awful. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=307.18s)]
*  So they have low birth rates. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=310.82000000000005s)]
*  They're not getting married and a whole generation is called laying down. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=312.3s)]
*  They are called laying flat. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=318.1s)]
*  The youth from 18 to 34 are deciding to drop out of school and not have a job, lay flat. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=319.94s)]
*  Good luck with that superpower. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=326.74s)]
*  So they got some problems. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=329.94s)]
*  And I think this has forced them to the negotiation table as a result of that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=332.26000000000005s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij_k_3RrWrQ&t=336.26s)]
