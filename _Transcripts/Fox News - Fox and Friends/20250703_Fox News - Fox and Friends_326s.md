# Dems risk DEEP losses with this strategy
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0)
*  The Democrat Party remains at a crossroads as they take from the GOP playbook with Project [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=0.0s)]
*  2029. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=8.76s)]
*  The goal is to mirror the strategy of Project 2025 with a more politically centered team [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=10.24s)]
*  in order to unite Democrats on key policy issues. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=16.1s)]
*  Let's bring in Selena Zito, National Political Reporter for the Washington Examiner. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=19.64s)]
*  Great to see you, Selena. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=24.1s)]
*  So it really is amazing when you sit back right now and you look at the difference between [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=25.1s)]
*  Donald Trump and the MAGA agenda and then the blatant socialism, communism that Democrat [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=30.900000000000002s)]
*  voters are embracing right now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=39.22s)]
*  Yeah, you know, this is the challenge for Democrats. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=41.38s)]
*  They have appeared to be stuck. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=46.42s)]
*  And I believe they started being stuck in the middle of Biden's administration and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=49.9s)]
*  that continued with Harris's candidacy, but has been, you know, still staying there since [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=55.339999999999996s)]
*  the election and since the inauguration. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=62.44s)]
*  They can't seem to get their footing in a way to appeal to the middle of the country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=65.16s)]
*  To win presidential elections, you have to be able to appeal to the working class and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=71.1s)]
*  They're not putting forth those ideals that will bring them over. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=77.38000000000001s)]
*  So Democrats in New York City have lined up between Zoran Mamdani. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=82.42s)]
*  Listen to what some of his, his democratic socialist agenda is. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=86.34s)]
*  Our police force should not be assisting ICE. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=94.26s)]
*  Defund the NYPD and refund all of these different social services. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=97.66000000000001s)]
*  I will create a network of city owned grocery stores. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=101.98s)]
*  It's like a public option for produce. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=104.66s)]
*  I'll freeze the rent for millions of tenants, make buses fast and free and deliver universal [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=106.74s)]
*  childcare. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=111.13999999999999s)]
*  And before you ask, I'll pay for it by taxing the rich. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=112.13999999999999s)]
*  As mayor, New York City would arrest Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=115.1s)]
*  You think voters are scrambling for government run grocery stores? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=119.1s)]
*  That is not going to play out. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=125.78s)]
*  In Erie, Pennsylvania, that is not so. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=126.78s)]
*  So if they're going to put forth candidates and they're going to put forth an agenda that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=129.74s)]
*  mimics what he is saying, they're going to suffer deep losses in the midterms in a midterm [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=134.3s)]
*  or and or next presidential campaign that shouldn't be the one that they win. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=141.54000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=147.74s)]
*  Traditionally, you win a midterm election. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=148.74s)]
*  You're not going to win states like Pennsylvania with if you have to be stand side by side [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=150.78s)]
*  with so Ron and and accept what he's saying in your state. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=157.5s)]
*  Yeah, Selena, let's talk about your book. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=161.78s)]
*  I finished it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=163.38s)]
*  It's excellent. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=164.74s)]
*  I recommend everyone pick it up. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=165.74s)]
*  It's called Butler. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=166.9s)]
*  And who better to write this book? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  You were standing a few feet from Donald Trump when when that all happened on July 13th, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=169.54000000000002s)]
*  two thousand twenty four, you were in the buffer zone with your daughter and your daughter [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=174.98000000000002s)]
*  thought fireworks and you've heard a man yell, excuse me, you heard a man yell, get down, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=179.58s)]
*  get down. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=185.3s)]
*  So tell us what that day was like and why you wrote this book. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=186.34s)]
*  So the day was started out as a normal day as a reporter and and the and the rally started [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  out as a normal Trump rally. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=197.10000000000002s)]
*  People were very excited. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=198.9s)]
*  They're very happy to have him come back to Butler through a series of zigzags. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=200.06s)]
*  I end up in in the buffer waiting. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=207.02s)]
*  I'm supposed to fly with the president, along with my daughter, to Bedminster to interview [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=210.82s)]
*  him. That's why that's the only reason that that I was in such close proximity. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=216.26s)]
*  And he did two things that he's never done before. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=222.85999999999999s)]
*  And that's bring a chart down. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  And I'm thinking, what are you, Ross Perot? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=228.14s)]
*  And but but also he turns away from the rally. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=230.1s)]
*  And in those moments, I hear pop, pop, pop, pop. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=234.26s)]
*  I knew exactly what the what that was. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=237.06s)]
*  It's the conversations after with the president the next day and throughout the election [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  that you find that he has a man that is renewed in faith, that that believes that he has [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=246.1s)]
*  purpose because the hand of God was there and that he is to be a person of consequence. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=252.7s)]
*  Now, that is also something that you see ripple through the people that you I interview [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=259.74s)]
*  throughout the rest of the campaign. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=264.98s)]
*  Faith, purpose and consequence become a theme in the country. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=266.98s)]
*  And it's not it's it's a nuance that people don't don't typically find in a poll. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=272.58s)]
*  But if you were on the ground and listening to people, it was reflected back and forth [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=279.3s)]
*  between President Trump, but also the people that he was galvanizing to to come towards [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=284.26s)]
*  his platform and towards his presidency. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=291.42s)]
*  Truly divine intervention. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=294.62s)]
*  And you write at the end of the book that you went back with him a few months later. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=296.06s)]
*  I think it was three months later. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=299.58s)]
*  You got there 15 hours before so you could be on Fox and Friends. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=300.9s)]
*  So thank you so much, Selena. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=304.65999999999997s)]
*  You're the best and P.A. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=305.9s)]
*  You got us through the election. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=307.3s)]
*  You were you're just knowledgeable about that state when it comes to elections and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=308.53999999999996s)]
*  anything, Donald Trump. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=312.97999999999996s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=313.9s)]
*  Thanks, Lena. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEY8JQx-ji0&t=314.5s)]
