# ‘What changed?’: Luigi Mangione's former classmate shocked by arrest
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM)
*  Let's bring in Fred Leatherberry. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=0.0s)]
*  He graduated from Gilman High School, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=1.74s)]
*  the prestigious school with Mangione was valedictorian. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=3.44s)]
*  Here, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=7.4s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=9.48s)]
*  Who's the kid you knew that's now a young man? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=11.28s)]
*  Well, good morning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=15.18s)]
*  Thank you for having me on. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=16.02s)]
*  The Luigi that I knew and that so many classmates knew [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=17.02s)]
*  was a hardworking, driven social kid [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=19.76s)]
*  who had everything going for him. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=22.26s)]
*  And you hear this in the testimony [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=23.76s)]
*  from his post-grad roommate as well. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=24.92s)]
*  It's like a different person [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=27.7s)]
*  that we're seeing in all the headlines [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=28.94s)]
*  and the yelling and the arraignment. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=30.82s)]
*  Something has happened in the last eight years, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=34.72s)]
*  but back when I knew him, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=36.32s)]
*  he was nice and polite and driven, athletic. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=37.660000000000004s)]
*  He really had everything going for him [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=41.0s)]
*  and he was everything you could want in a high school kid. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=43.02s)]
*  Freddie, did you see the change in him? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=45.5s)]
*  For example, on social media, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=47.6s)]
*  did he start to become an activist over time? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=49.2s)]
*  Did you see different posting, taking on the system? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  You know, not really. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=56.74s)]
*  I saw the post on his Twitter after the fact, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=58.02s)]
*  but plenty of people start to get into ideology. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=61.36s)]
*  So that in itself didn't really raise any flags. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=63.9s)]
*  What was in the post? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=66.9s)]
*  Yeah, the post. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=69.06s)]
*  I mean, people have grievances with society [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=70.1s)]
*  and don't act on it all the time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=73.14s)]
*  So that to me wasn't his own red flag, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=74.6s)]
*  but drawing the connections after the fact [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=77.48s)]
*  certainly makes it all more sense. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=79.88s)]
*  It's really hard to really label what his ideology is. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=81.32s)]
*  On the one hand, there are posts that are, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=84.92s)]
*  he's sort of endorsing right-wing ideas, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=88.8s)]
*  but he's also, he got vaccinated, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=91.33999999999999s)]
*  he was a climate activist, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=93.64s)]
*  he also supported some things online that AOC said. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=95.94s)]
*  So do you have any idea what it is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=99.58s)]
*  at any kind of contact with other people [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=102.92s)]
*  from your school that have stayed in touch with him [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=108.22s)]
*  or follow him on social media? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=111.0s)]
*  Can any clues at all among your circle of friends? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=112.41999999999999s)]
*  Among my circle of friends, not really. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=117.25999999999999s)]
*  I wasn't terribly close with Luigi. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=119.46s)]
*  We all knew each other. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=121.25999999999999s)]
*  It was a small school, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=122.22s)]
*  but as far as any inclinations in school, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=123.6s)]
*  in any direction politically, there really wasn't any. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=126.3s)]
*  Of course, not everybody falls into a left or right bucket [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=129.24s)]
*  and his grievances seem to be [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=131.64s)]
*  with the healthcare industry specifically, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=132.9s)]
*  but there was nothing about that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=135.18s)]
*  that I can remember in the eight years [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=136.64s)]
*  since I graduated from high school. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=138.28s)]
*  Oh, let's go ahead. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=140.18s)]
*  And Freddie, I think you told one of our producers, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=141.38s)]
*  do you think that his actions were politically motivated, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  the little guy versus the big guy mentality? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=146.94000000000003s)]
*  I got a question for you though. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=150.0s)]
*  In the last week, when that image of him [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=151.34s)]
*  pulling down the mask and also with the eyebrows [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  in the car and stuff like that, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=158.62s)]
*  for a moment, did you think to yourself, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  you know, that looks like Luigi? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  You know, that's interesting. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  I think when something so large profile happens nationally, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  I automatically disregard that it could be anybody [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=171.0s)]
*  that I know, just out of instinct. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=174.26s)]
*  And the thing that I remember about Luigi, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=175.8s)]
*  if anything, was his really distinct curly hair. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  And in all the security camera footage, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=180.64s)]
*  all you saw was him with a hat on or a hood on. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=182.14s)]
*  So that wasn't a connection that I was making. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=184.94s)]
*  And of course, Italians in New York are down a dozen. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=187.04s)]
*  So just the jaw structure alone, the face, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=189.38s)]
*  that wasn't a connection that I was really rushing to make. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=192.24s)]
*  So I really just brushed that off when I saw it, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=194.94s)]
*  to be honest. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=197.16s)]
*  So when you, your school is a elite school, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=198.16s)]
*  it's got this incredible reputation. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=202.34s)]
*  So has the University of Pennsylvania. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=203.88s)]
*  What's been the reaction amongst your classmates? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=206.48s)]
*  Do you worry about the school being looked at differently [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=208.73999999999998s)]
*  now that it reflects on all of you? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=211.42s)]
*  Well, it's natural when the school is in the headlines [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=214.66s)]
*  in such a negative light for things to go back there, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=217.12s)]
*  for narratives to be tied back there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=219.76s)]
*  I don't think that's terribly fair to my school, to Gilman. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=221.82s)]
*  You know, there are a lot of really good, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=226.2s)]
*  hardworking people. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=227.2s)]
*  For every Luigi that it creates, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=228.4s)]
*  it creates tens of thousands, if not more, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=230.22s)]
*  really hardworking family men. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=232.72s)]
*  So I don't believe that there's any real justification [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=235.26s)]
*  in tying anything back to Gilman. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  I know the PR department there has a nightmare [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=240.5s)]
*  on their hands right now, as it is. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=243.29999999999998s)]
*  So I hope we isolate this incident. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=244.83999999999997s)]
*  Freddie, what would you ask him if you saw him today? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=247.77999999999997s)]
*  I'd say, what changed, man? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=251.44s)]
*  You know, I wish we could get inside of his head. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  I know we're kind of getting that in a little bit, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=256.28s)]
*  but there's a lot we would like to learn about [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=257.88s)]
*  if he was thinking. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=260.12s)]
*  No kidding. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  Freddie Leatherberry joining us from Baltimore. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=261.8s)]
*  Thanks, Freddie. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QXp4_4rZM&t=263.96000000000004s)]
