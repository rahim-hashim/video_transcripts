# Top Dem announces retirement as age becomes 'toxic' issue for party
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI)
*  The second ranked Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin, say he's retiring after five terms, ending [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=0.0s)]
*  his 44 congressional year career. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  That's right, senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram is live on Capitol Hill, where [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Chad you have covered this guy for a very long time. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=16.92s)]
*  Long time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=20.46s)]
*  A sea change for the Democrats with Dick Durbin announcing his retirement. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=21.46s)]
*  He first won election to the House in 1982, the Senate in 1996. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=26.419999999999998s)]
*  His retirement signals a youth movement in the party. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=31.56s)]
*  In my heart, I know it's time to pass the torch. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=36.4s)]
*  So I'm announcing today that I will not be seeking reelection at the end of my term. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=39.5s)]
*  I'll do everything in my power to fight for Illinois and the future of our country every [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  day of my remaining time in the Senate. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=48.18s)]
*  After last year's debacle over age with former President Biden, political longevity is toxic [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=51.46s)]
*  in the Democratic Party. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=56.58s)]
*  There's a push on the left for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to step down from his [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=58.46s)]
*  post, especially after Schumer helped President Trump avoid a government shutdown last month. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=62.58s)]
*  A Sienna poll has Schumer plummeting to his lowest approval rating in two decades. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=67.92s)]
*  Polls always come and go. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=74.78s)]
*  I'm focused on making sure the people of New York and the people of America know how bad [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=76.06s)]
*  Trump is. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=82.10000000000001s)]
*  And I have found throughout my career, you do your job and everything works out just fine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=83.10000000000001s)]
*  Democratic New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is polling ahead of Schumer. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=87.98s)]
*  Some progressives want her to challenge him in a primary. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=93.9s)]
*  I really don't see Ocasio-Cortez defeating him in a Democratic primary in New York. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=97.78s)]
*  I mean, Schumer is absolutely omnipresent on New York television. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  You cannot turn on a network station in New York City on a weekend without seeing Chuck Schumer's face. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=109.74s)]
*  There are two races to succeed Durbin. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=118.06s)]
*  One is in Illinois, the other in the Senate. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=120.7s)]
*  Brian Schatz of Hawaii has the inside track to become the Democratic whip. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=123.74s)]
*  Also watch Democrats Cory Booker, Chris Murphy and Amy Klobuchar. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=128.42s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=132.85999999999999s)]
*  Plus also, Chad, he runs a very powerful committee in the Senate, so that job's up too. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=133.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, to be the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=140.06s)]
*  He was the chairman when the Democrats had the majority. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=143.1s)]
*  And again, if you have a Supreme Court nominee coming through, certainly doing all this that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  they're talking about the past few months with judges. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=151.14s)]
*  Republicans want to rein in judges. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  That's something that Dick Durbin has talked a lot about. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=156.42s)]
*  He gave a floor speech in late March talking about how he thought that the Trump administration [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=158.7s)]
*  was stepping over the line. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=163.45999999999998s)]
*  So whoever gets that job, I would look maybe at Amy Klobuchar would be one person. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=165.1s)]
*  Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island, those would be the top two I would look at first. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=169.26s)]
*  Yeah, what about this report about David Hogg, who's the deputy director of the DNC, basically [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  got an ultimatum, don't primary people and stop talking about what the problems with [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=179.82s)]
*  the party. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=183.82s)]
*  Could that, could David Hogg's sense of change mindset win out on the Democrats? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=184.9s)]
*  Could Schumer be heading out the door? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, it depends. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=192.42s)]
*  Durbin's retiring? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=193.42s)]
*  Could he actually have a ground as well? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=194.42s)]
*  Yeah, there's definitely this youth movement going on here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  And David Hogg has talked about primaring some of these more veteran Democrats here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=198.98s)]
*  The DNC is basically saying, you know, our position is that if you have a leadership [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=203.62s)]
*  position in the Democratic Party, you are to stay neutral. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=207.94s)]
*  So whether or not there's a clash there, that could be a problem. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=211.5s)]
*  But nonetheless, there is this push to infuse the Democratic Party with new blood. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=214.14s)]
*  Just this morning, there was an announcement, this is not a primary challenge, but Aliyah [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=219.18s)]
*  Nadim, who's a Republican and until a couple of weeks ago, was the head of the Senate doorkeepers, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=223.1s)]
*  that's a security position here at the Capitol. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=229.34s)]
*  She is running as a Republican against Marcy Capter, a Democrat from Northern Ohio, the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=231.74s)]
*  longest serving woman in House history, first elected back in the early 1980s. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=236.98s)]
*  That is a district that Capter won by only about a thousand votes and President Trump [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=242.73999999999998s)]
*  carried it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=246.94s)]
*  So again, you know, that's where some people might say, is it time for us to run some younger [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=247.94s)]
*  candidates there? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=251.89999999999998s)]
*  To be frank, Marcy Capter has always been a juggernaut in that district. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=253.66s)]
*  That's something that has gone on for years and years where Republicans have tried to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=258.02s)]
*  knock her out. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=261.32s)]
*  But Aliyah Nadim, you know, is younger than her by decades. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=262.56s)]
*  Again, that's a Republican candidate. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=266.18s)]
*  So what happens with Marcy Capter? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=267.78s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=269.62s)]
*  What about Dick Durbin? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=270.62s)]
*  Is there a chance that a Republican could win that seat? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=271.62s)]
*  Very unlikely. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=275.46s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't that long ago. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=276.46s)]
*  You know, you have to go back 20 years ago where you had a Republican in the Senate from [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=278.09999999999997s)]
*  Illinois. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=282.02s)]
*  In fact, that was Barack Obama's predecessor. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=283.02s)]
*  That district, that state, I should say, definitely trended a little bit like most places did [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=285.74s)]
*  toward President Trump. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=290.9s)]
*  But it's a big deficit to get over that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=291.97999999999996s)]
*  It's very hard, I think, for a Republican to win statewide. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=293.78s)]
*  The Republicans will do very well downstate. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=296.61999999999995s)]
*  But you get Chicago. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=298.85999999999996s)]
*  I used the word juggernaut a minute ago. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=299.85999999999996s)]
*  It would be very tough. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=302.09999999999997s)]
*  I would look at Robin Kelly, a Democratic House member, Rajakrishna Morthy, a Democratic [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=303.09999999999997s)]
*  House member, and also Lauren Underwood. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=307.4s)]
*  They would be the frontrunners to run for the Democratic nomination. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=310.05999999999995s)]
*  Well, we tried hard to stump you, but you know the answer to everything. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=313.26s)]
*  Chad, thank you very much. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=316.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=317.78s)]
*  Throw me an algebra problem or something here. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=318.78s)]
*  Yeah, I wish we had the time. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=321.14s)]
*  We need Washington Jeopardy for you. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=322.26s)]
*  I love it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=325.02s)]
*  I watch Jeopardy every night. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=326.02s)]
*  And I always put on X if there's a congressional question. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=327.34s)]
*  That's what I always do. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=330.82s)]
*  Look at my feed every time. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=331.82s)]
*  I've got it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=333.3s)]
*  It's the least surprising thing you've ever said. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=334.3s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=335.78s)]
*  All right, Chad, thank you very much. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHC7AKObmRI&t=336.78s)]
