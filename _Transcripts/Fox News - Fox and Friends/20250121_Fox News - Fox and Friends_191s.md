# Trump 'not confident' Hamas cease-fire will hold
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc)
*  To a Fox News alert, America's getting older. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump says he is not confident the Israeli Hamas ceasefire deal will hold through [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=2.44s)]
*  all three phases as he takes immediate action in support of the Jewish state. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=9.56s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live in Tel Aviv with more. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Hey Trey. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=16.36s)]
*  Hey guys, good morning. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=17.36s)]
*  Overnight President Trump signed a series of executive orders in the Oval Office. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=20.12s)]
*  He took the opportunity to speak with a small group of journalists that were part of the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=24.68s)]
*  expanded press pool. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=28.8s)]
*  Now he made many headlines discussing foreign policy, including new insights about the ceasefire [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=30.64s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  How confident are you Mr. President that you can keep the ceasefire in Gaza and conclude [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=38.84s)]
*  the three phases of the deal? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=44.0s)]
*  I'm not confident. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=45.6s)]
*  That's not our words, that's our words. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=46.6s)]
*  I'm not confident, but I think they're very weakened on the other side. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=47.6s)]
*  Gaza, boy, I looked at a picture of Gaza. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=51.6s)]
*  Gaza is like a massive demolition site. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  It's really got to be rebuilt in a different way. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=57.52s)]
*  The president is exactly right. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=65.72s)]
*  There is a catastrophic level of destruction to Gaza. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=67.2s)]
*  The World Bank estimates more than $18 billion worth of damage to the enclave. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  And if the ceasefire collapses after phase one, that number will rise. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=75.2s)]
*  Before speaking in the Oval Office, the commander in chief met with the families of hostages [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=79.72s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=84.26s)]
*  As he addressed the crowd at the Capital One Arena, behind him was freed hostage Noah [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=85.26s)]
*  Argamani. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=89.38000000000001s)]
*  She was rescued during an Israeli operation in June. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=90.38000000000001s)]
*  Now given the ceasefire that went into effect just three days ago, there is hope in the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=93.66000000000001s)]
*  region about the possibility of a broader agreement that could bring in more normalization [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=99.02000000000001s)]
*  deals. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=104.14s)]
*  President Trump discussed this last night in the Oval Office, saying that there could [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=105.14s)]
*  be a deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia as early as this year. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  Guys? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=112.82s)]
*  Hey Trey, how is this being received in Israel, the deal, would you say? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=115.82s)]
*  I know it's tough to, for the most part, do you think people are pleased by it, frustrated [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=119.94s)]
*  by it? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=124.66s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=125.66s)]
*  At this point, they have some hope after so many months of waiting. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=128.18s)]
*  It was 470 days that these women were held inside Gaza. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=131.26s)]
*  And you heard Israeli leaders coming out and thanking President Trump and his Middle East [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=135.78s)]
*  envoy, Steve Witkoff. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=139.34s)]
*  But I think when we look at the broader region here, the Israelis are already using this [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=141.16s)]
*  new administration as an opportunity to take the gloves off against many of the factions [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=144.85999999999999s)]
*  like Hamas and Islamic Jihad across the region. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  Just as we are talking here, there's some breaking news in the Middle East. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  The Israelis right now are conducting a counter-terrorism operation in the West Bank city of Jenin. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=157.12s)]
*  This is an area where we know there are many of these militant cells, and it appears this [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=163.32s)]
*  is a large-scale operation that could last even a number of days here in the Middle East. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=167.78s)]
*  Guys? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=174.26s)]
*  Wow, that just happened. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=175.26s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=177.62s)]
*  I appreciate it, Trey. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHipYl_wbKc&t=178.62s)]
