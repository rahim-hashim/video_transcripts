# Lawrence Jones: Will voters be tricked into believing this?
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ)
*  So, Kavala here is testing the waters on changing her immigration messaging to border state voters. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  So, I was attorney general of a border state. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  I went after the transnational gangs, the drug cartels and human traffickers. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=12.24s)]
*  We know our immigration system is broken and we know what it takes to fix it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=17.76s)]
*  It includes strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=23.76s)]
*  We had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan border security bill in decades. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=32.400000000000006s)]
*  But when I am president, I will sign the bill. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=39.2s)]
*  I want to do something about it now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=42.2s)]
*  Here to react is Pinal County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Lamb. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=45.08s)]
*  So, Sheriff, let's go through some of her records before she had this wake-up call, I guess. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  So, she supported all undocumented migrants and said that they are not criminal. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=53.72s)]
*  She said, we must re-examine ICE and its role, meaning defund it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=58.92s)]
*  We must fundamentally overhaul our immigration enforcement policies and practices. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=62.56s)]
*  They are cruel and out of control. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=66.92s)]
*  So, do you think voters will be tricked into believing this new Kavala Harris? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=69.32s)]
*  Well, I think there's always going to be some level of voters that are going to be tricked into it, clearly, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=76.32s)]
*  because every poll shows you could run the worst poll in the world and there's still always going to be 30% that like it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=80.28s)]
*  So, yeah, there are going to be people that are going to be tricked. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  But hopefully the majority of the voters, certainly here in Arizona, know that this administration, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=87.64s)]
*  to include Kamala Harris as the borders are, have done a horrible job on so many levels, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=92.88s)]
*  especially at the southern border. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  And I wouldn't be bragging about what she did in California if there's one place that's almost as bad as the federal government is. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  It's California. They have failed at everything as well. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=107.0s)]
*  So, we can't expect that she's going to do any better than what she's already done. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=109.8s)]
*  And what she has done is terrible. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  So, Mark, you know, you've been on the border for a while. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=118.32s)]
*  You've been a sheriff for a while, covering this issue for a while. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=121.0s)]
*  What do you think Republicans need to do differently to highlight this issue? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=125.24s)]
*  Because I do worry about the voters buying, OK, maybe she is a moderate on this issue. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=130.2s)]
*  What can they do to make it very clear to the American people that she's a radical when it comes to the border? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=136.4s)]
*  You know, what Americans need to know is how does it affect their daily life? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=143.36s)]
*  I think they need to talk about the economical impact that it's having, which is why it's driving some of the prices we have, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=146.8s)]
*  higher prices in this country. There's housing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  There's people that are getting $2,200 checks or over $2,000 checks while people on Social Security are not getting that money. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=155.4s)]
*  Or homeless veterans are on our streets and not getting free housing like some of these illegals are. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=163.16s)]
*  I would certainly hit on that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=168.84s)]
*  But I would definitely hit on the crimes like the Lake and Riley, like the Rachel Moore and the Jocelyn Nungare. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=170.44s)]
*  Those are all issues that affect all of us as Americans. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=176.44s)]
*  I think they should also focus heavily on fentanyl. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=179.68s)]
*  Fentanyl is the leading cause of death in America between the ages of 18 and 45. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=183.32s)]
*  And it is because they're killing over 100,000 Americans a year. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=188.4s)]
*  I would really hammer home on those things as Republicans. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=192.24s)]
*  It resonates. Having run for Senate, I wasn't successful, but I was very successful in that messaging. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=195.52s)]
*  It really hits home and people get it and they don't want to hear that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=201.36s)]
*  They want change. And Kamala is not going to be the change that the American people are looking for. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, Mark, you may have not been successful, but I know a lot of people were rooting for you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=210.36s)]
*  And part of it is because you just clearly made the case. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  There's a criminal aspect to the border security. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=217.84s)]
*  There's a health and safety aspect to it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  And there's also an economic impact. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  You just made it for our audience. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=225.08s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining the program this morning. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Lawrence. Always good to see you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=230.08s)]
*  You too, brother. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfDPAQ5SVlQ&t=231.60000000000002s)]
