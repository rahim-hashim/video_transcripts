# Former Dem helping Trump prepare for Harris debate
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs)
*  All right, meanwhile, the Trump and Harris campaigns are battling over debate rules as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=0.0s)]
*  the candidates head to key swing states this week. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=5.78s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey joins us live from the White House. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=9.44s)]
*  Hey Peter. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=12.44s)]
*  And a familiar name that we can talk about this morning, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=13.8s)]
*  She had the sharpest lines of attack against then Senator Harris on the debate stages in [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=17.3s)]
*  2020. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  She is now helping Donald Trump prepare for his debate with Harris behind the scenes and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  she is officially joining his effort to beat her. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=28.52s)]
*  It's not about Democrats versus Republicans. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=34.08s)]
*  It's about having a president who stands for freedom, peace and prosperity, which is Donald [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=36.84s)]
*  Trump, versus having a president in Kamala Harris who attacks our freedoms and censors [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=42.16s)]
*  us and uses political retaliation, who has pushed us to the brink of war and who's created [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=47.64s)]
*  this economic hardship for Americans across the country. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=53.86s)]
*  The Harris campaign is showing their hand in terms of priorities, visiting just one [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=57.24s)]
*  battleground state this week, but for two days. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  Georgia. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=64.0s)]
*  Trump has Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania ahead before the weekend as a very unlikely [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=65.0s)]
*  celebrity is coming forward saying they hope Joe Biden does something that Trump did. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  Kim Kardashian has posted on X. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=76.04s)]
*  Last week, I had the opportunity to visit the Department of Justice. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=78.28s)]
*  I hope President Biden takes the opportunity to make clemency a significant part of his [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=82.88s)]
*  legacy before he leaves office. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  Hashtag clemency now. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=90.72s)]
*  President Biden has been joking before he went on vacation that he will campaign for [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  or against Harris, whatever she thinks would help. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=97.36s)]
*  It seems that the calculation at least for now has been made that he should just stay [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=101.32s)]
*  out of it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=105.56s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=106.56s)]
*  Which is doing a good job. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=107.56s)]
*  Peter, speaking of clemency, the conventional wisdom is Joe Biden will pardon his son Hunter [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=108.64s)]
*  after the election, right? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=117.0s)]
*  Well that depends if you believe what Joe Biden and all of his top officials have said, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=119.64s)]
*  which is that he will not under any circumstances pardon Hunter Biden. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=124.2s)]
*  I go ahead. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=128.88s)]
*  It's a big he's only going to have the power of clemency and the pardon until January. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=130.4s)]
*  So he definitely could. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=136.2s)]
*  It's not like he's never done anything that he contrary to what he said. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=138.52s)]
*  But it's possible another thought about this. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=144.16s)]
*  It is possible that he just hasn't worked out with Kamala Harris. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  Something like I'll endorse you, but if something comes down when you're the president, I need [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=151.96s)]
*  you to let him go. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he's got to get convicted again. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=158.4s)]
*  He's got to run in September or not get exonerated. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=160.0s)]
*  Yeah, I bet that was part of the deal. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=162.44s)]
*  I will step down if you endorse, I'll endorse you, Kamala. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=164.96s)]
*  Kamala has to be the nominee and Kamala, you have to promise me that you're going to pardon [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=168.72s)]
*  my son. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  Or if she doesn't win in November, then he'll pardon him before he steps down. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  Remember, James Comer wraps up his investigation, said, by the way, there's $27 million in flow [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=178.0s)]
*  to the Biden family now that the Bidens are flowing right out of the White House. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=181.24s)]
*  It is kind of amazing before we get into this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  How many Biden officials are now Kamala Harris officials? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=187.4s)]
*  Just like that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=190.32s)]
*  The same people tell us that Joe is fine. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=191.32s)]
*  He's going to be great. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to win the reelection. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  I work for the other person. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  Is there anyone in the White House at all? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  Do they even have someone to back you? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=198.04s)]
*  And he's on vacation again for the second week in a row. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=199.6s)]
*  What's interesting is that- [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=202.64s)]
*  Our country is running itself. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=203.64s)]
*  That circle of people around Joe Biden who right up until the debate said, you know, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=205.16s)]
*  go for it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=210.92s)]
*  You're the only person who can beat Trump. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=211.92s)]
*  It's like, you're fantastic. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=213.12s)]
*  You're great. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=214.28s)]
*  Wow, we saw that show. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=215.28s)]
*  Get out. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  We're going to work for her. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  It was that quick. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  They never acknowledge it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  They just pop up representing somebody else. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=221.2s)]
*  Well, it works. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=224.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=225.72s)]
*  Let's talk about the thing that's most important to Americans, and that is the economy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=226.72s)]
*  And if you look at some of the stats about what means the most to Fox News poll, the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=230.24s)]
*  top issue of the day, in February, 37 percent of you said the economy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  Now 38 percent say it's not going away. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=237.2s)]
*  And this is the key within the subset is inflation. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=239.92s)]
*  It is lower than it was obviously when it was high in 2022, but it's still 3 percent [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  above the- the prices are now 20 percent above where they were at food prices. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  And that's when Joe Biden took over. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=255.08s)]
*  They're only the- keep in mind with inflation, it's only going up 3 percent instead of 9 [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=256.08s)]
*  percent. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=260.68s)]
*  Inflation might be going down, but the rate of the price of goods is still up. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=261.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=264.56s)]
*  And when you look at that, you look at that mountain right there with that blue, that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=265.56s)]
*  blue line right there, what happened at that point? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=269.6s)]
*  That was when all that federal money was coming into the economy. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's what caused the inflation to spike up over north of 9 percent. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=276.72s)]
*  And who was the person who broke the tie in the Senate to make sure that the American [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  rescue group went through? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  She had the gavel. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=287.64000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  She absolutely did. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=289.64000000000004s)]
*  It was 50-50. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  Kamala Harris said, okay, I'm going to pass that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=291.64000000000004s)]
*  Then she also broke the tie when it came to the 2022 and 2023 fiscal year spending budgets, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=293.0s)]
*  which pumped more spending into the economy, causing the inflation that we're talking [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=299.56s)]
*  about. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=306.04s)]
*  So she has got her fingerprints on inflation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=307.04s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because Politico has a new piece that came out this morning. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=309.36s)]
*  Can I just vote for her instead of Biden? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=312.36s)]
*  And it talks about the Kamala Harris campaign, trying to scramble to get the Hispanic vote. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=314.24s)]
*  And they thought that she would be able to recover after Biden when it came to the border [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=320.04s)]
*  and all of that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=324.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, it comes to find out that the number one issue for Latinos and Hispanic Americans [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  is the economy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=329.72s)]
*  Of course. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=330.72s)]
*  And she's struggling on that issue, and they're not rallying behind her. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=331.72s)]
*  So whatever group you're talking about in the country, black American, Hispanic American, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  everyone is struggling right now. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=339.2s)]
*  Well, Axios is reporting that her campaign is now saying they might not have enough time [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=341.16s)]
*  to release her policies. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=346.44s)]
*  The reason she doesn't want her policies released is because her campaign is saying she's flip [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=347.76s)]
*  flopping on a lot of her past voting record, including no fracking. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=351.88s)]
*  The list goes on and on of things that she wants to take away or did want to take away [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=357.4s)]
*  your health insurance plan. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=362.08s)]
*  Now she's big on the border. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=363.32s)]
*  She was never big on the border. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=365.04s)]
*  You see the inflation rates. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=366.2s)]
*  That was under the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=367.96s)]
*  And now Trump is going after her for all these expensive items in the grocery store, how [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=370.88s)]
*  high gas prices are. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=375.9s)]
*  She can't defend herself because she over the past few years has been touting Bidenomics. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=378.12s)]
*  Look at Trump's latest campaign ad. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  Everyday prices are too high. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=388.24s)]
*  Food, rent, gas, back to school clothes. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=390.36s)]
*  That is called Bidenomics. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=394.4s)]
*  And she's saying she's trying to divorce herself from it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=398.52s)]
*  They tie her to it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=402.4s)]
*  Now Harris comes back and she's talking about this is her version of how she's strong in [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=403.4s)]
*  the economy. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=408.28s)]
*  Watch. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=409.28s)]
*  When I am elected president, I will make it a top priority to bring down cost. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=410.28s)]
*  I will fight to give money back to working and middle class Americans. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  So why hasn't she made it a top priority up until this point? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=419.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=422.91999999999996s)]
*  If you look at the full ad, when she goes after Donald Trump, she doesn't have any [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=423.92s)]
*  of his words. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  She just puts photos of him in that ad. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  Whereas in Donald Trump's ad, he highlights her words. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=432.36s)]
*  That just shows you they have nothing to run against him when it comes to economy. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=435.76s)]
*  They can steal his ideas, but they can't use his words and say, oh, okay, he's going [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=439.20000000000005s)]
*  to get rid of Medicare and all that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=446.16s)]
*  They say that in the ad, but they have no quote or any video of him saying he's going [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=447.56s)]
*  to get rid of Medicare. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=451.86s)]
*  But here's what I want to hear. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=452.98s)]
*  She says she's going to make everything more affordable. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=454.38s)]
*  That's the theme, affordability. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=456.56s)]
*  And in fact, that one minute everyday ad, they're going to start running in battleground [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=459.06s)]
*  states right now. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=463.58000000000004s)]
*  $150 million ad buy. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=465.38s)]
*  They raised half a billion in five weeks, so they got plenty of money to spend on that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=468.7s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=473.78000000000003s)]
*  That's my point, Ainsley. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=474.78000000000003s)]
*  She talks about how I'm going to make things more affordable, but she doesn't explain [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=475.88s)]
*  how. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=479.68s)]
*  If she would explain how, then people would go, okay, I think that's a good idea or a [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=481.0s)]
*  bad idea. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=485.15999999999997s)]
*  But by keeping it broad and vague, then it's like, well, she said she was going to make [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  things more affordable. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=490.24s)]
*  I'm just going to try. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=491.64s)]
*  Once she says how, many people are going to say, why the delay? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=492.64s)]
*  Why not start now then? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=497.52s)]
*  Only 29% of registered voters say that they're doing better than they were under Biden. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=498.8s)]
*  64%, that's two out of three, say they are worse off. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=504.8s)]
*  Independence, strongly disagree, saying 20% said they are better off under Biden. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=508.4s)]
*  Only 21%, 71% wish they had Trump economy back. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=513.04s)]
*  That's independence. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=516.88s)]
*  So that's obviously what Trump wants to be talking about now, and he's proud of what [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=517.9599999999999s)]
*  he did. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=521.48s)]
*  The only thing that she has brought out is she brought out price controls that didn't [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=522.48s)]
*  go over well. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=525.16s)]
*  She also brought out cracking down on gouging. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=526.28s)]
*  That didn't go over well. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=529.06s)]
*  Gaging. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=530.06s)]
*  Because that's how she pronounces it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=531.06s)]
*  And also the other thing she brought up is on housing, which is an interesting approach. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=533.36s)]
*  I am going to incentivize the building of two million homes. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=537.5s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=541.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHhu33mpNs&t=542.6600000000001s)]
