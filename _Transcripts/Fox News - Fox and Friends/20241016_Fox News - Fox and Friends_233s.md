# ‘WE NEED SOME HELP’: City overwhelmed by migrant surge
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg)
*  Logan's Port, Indiana city officials are speaking out about the influx of migrants into their area, calling it unsustainable. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=0.0s)]
*  Our next guest is a lifelong resident who says locals are not feeling safe there anymore and blames the Biden-Harris administration for what's happening in Logan's Port. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=10.0s)]
*  Dave Price joins us now. Good morning to you, Dave. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=19.0s)]
*  Hey, good morning. How are you? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=22.0s)]
*  Good morning. I know you grew up in the small town, a population of 18,000, about 78 miles north of Indianapolis, and you went back after college to raise a family and start a business. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=24.0s)]
*  And now what are you seeing? What are your concerns? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=35.0s)]
*  Well, we're just seeing a new influx of a population that Logan's Port is just not used to. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=37.0s)]
*  We had immigrants come in throughout the years to Logan's Port from the Mexico area. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=44.0s)]
*  So we have a lot of Hispanics in the area, which they have acclimated very well, and they've grown their businesses and they've earned the respect of Americans and we've respected them in return. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=51.0s)]
*  But what we're seeing now is a little different. It's coming from a third world country coming into Logan's Port. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=62.0s)]
*  And these individuals don't necessarily know the local laws or rules and how to behave here, basically. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=69.0s)]
*  And we just ask that our local leaders, state and federal, take a look at Logan's Port, Indiana. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=79.0s)]
*  We need some help here. We need some federal help. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=86.0s)]
*  We need transparency between our local officials and we need some more information and communication. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=89.0s)]
*  Dave, there's a local reporter that that spent weeks and weeks researching this for six weeks specifically and went to the commissioners meeting and the health department told the commissioners in your town that the schools, new students, they are now in large numbers. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=96.0s)]
*  They're flying from Haiti to Nicaragua to Mexico to the to the U.S. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=110.0s)]
*  Many of them are unaccompanied. Some haven't seen their parents in seven years. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=114.0s)]
*  In 2021, there were 14 Haitian students in the schools. In 2024, there are 207. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=118.0s)]
*  Housing, the health department said they're worried about safety because in some of these houses, there are 20 to 25 people living under one roof. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=125.0s)]
*  Your mayor says it's not sustainable. They need help and they have no idea how many people are coming in. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=133.0s)]
*  You're also worried about the safety issue. Tell us more about that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=138.0s)]
*  Yes, we just want people to feel safe here in Logan's Port. It's been a great community to live in the last decade. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=142.0s)]
*  Actually, it's the last century. I'm sorry. And it's been a wonderful place to raise your family and do business in. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=149.0s)]
*  And we wanted to continue down that path. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=156.0s)]
*  Dave, why are they coming to this small town, to your town? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=159.0s)]
*  Well, I believe they're coming for employment. I can't blame them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=163.0s)]
*  You know, I don't blame the Haitians at all on this. This is not their fault. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=167.0s)]
*  God bless them. They're coming from a third world country into America, land of opportunity. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=174.0s)]
*  And, you know, this is brand new to them, too. They probably feel like they won the lottery in a way. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=181.0s)]
*  And it's a new life for them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=186.0s)]
*  And they just need to adjust to the American life and learn to obey the laws here and how to behave. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=190.0s)]
*  Well, the local reporter talked to one Haitian that has a store there who used to work at Tyson Foods, which is located there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=198.0s)]
*  And he said he came there for the money for Tyson's food. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=205.0s)]
*  The reporter did call Tyson's and said, how many migrant teens work for you on the third shift? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=208.0s)]
*  And the reporter did not hear back. And you say we need a president that will enforce the border. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=213.0s)]
*  Dave, thank you so much for coming on. We'll continue to follow this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=217.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=220.0s)]
*  You're welcome. Have a good one. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=221.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpRQq1ayvKg&t=228.0s)]
