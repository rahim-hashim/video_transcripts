*  Some PT with the troops. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=42.04s)]
*  I'm still upright and fairly smoked from this morning. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  A little PT but just grateful to be here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for showing us around. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  To see UConn, to see AFRICOMN, to see all the supporting staff and to have some time [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=53.92s)]
*  to spend with all of you just to break bread and talk about your mission, what you're doing, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  why you're doing it, what it's all about and how important it is to us back in Washington [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=63.52s)]
*  who very eagerly and actively want to get out to the COCOMNs and hear from the people [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  actually doing the heavy lifting. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=72.44s)]
*  Now Stuttgart's home to the U.S. military's European and Africa commands. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=75.72s)]
*  Here's the Defense Secretary at an honor cordon earlier greeted by the head of U.S. forces [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=79.48s)]
*  in Europe and the Supreme Allied Commander for NATO General Christopher Cavoli. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=83.72s)]
*  Now before touching down in Germany, Hegseth signed a new memorandum aboard a U.S. Air Force C-17 [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=87.72s)]
*  bringing back the name Fort Bragg. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=92.92s)]
*  Pursuant to the authority of the Secretary of Defense, Title 10 United States Code Section 113, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=97.2s)]
*  I direct the Army to change the name of Fort Liberty, North Carolina to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=103.16s)]
*  That's right, Bragg is back. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=111.16s)]
*  So the name Fort Bragg is back but with a twist guys. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=116.24s)]
*  It will not be named after the former Confederate General. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=118.96s)]
*  Instead, the new name pays tribute to private first class Roland Bragg, a World War II hero [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=121.36s)]
*  who earned the Silver Star and Purple Heart during the Battle of the Bulge. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=126.36s)]
*  Recall under then President Biden, Fort Bragg was changed to the name Fort Liberty. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  So Defense Secretary Hegseth is wrapping up some morning meetings behind me or afternoon now behind me [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  here at the European command. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=138.56s)]
*  It was interesting after that honor court on guys who was greeted by some protesters, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=140.56s)]
*  some family members from some of the service members on the base. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=143.76s)]
*  They were chanting DEI guys. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=146.36s)]
*  So Lucas, the sec def I saw on his Twitter page did some PT with the soldiers. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=149.16s)]
*  Did you get in on that action? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=157.36s)]
*  Lawrence, I knew you'd ask and I'd have to come clean. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=161.16s)]
*  I did not make it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=163.96s)]
*  Cred to the Defense Secretary is only after a few hours sleep. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=166.16s)]
*  It was up and at him this morning, but it's a long day for us. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=168.96s)]
*  So we had to get a little crew rest. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=171.56s)]
*  Lawrence, we called it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=173.36s)]
*  I think that the name change, the Lucas that you just mentioned, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg is so creative. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=177.16s)]
*  And it really seems like a way of just thumbing their nose into the original name change of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=181.36s)]
*  going from Fort Bragg to Fort Liberty, which alienated a lot of soldiers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=188.16s)]
*  They thought it was a ridiculous thing to do. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  They're going back to Fort Bragg, but honoring a World War II soldier. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, how creative is that? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=196.56s)]
*  Very clever is what some people say. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=199.96s)]
*  Carly wanted to bring back Fort Bragg, but there was some concern. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=201.56s)]
*  There may be some pushback going back to Braxton Bragg, Confederate general. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  So they found a hero, a Silver Star recipient in World War II at the Battle of the Bulge. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=208.56s)]
*  Private First Class Roland Bragg. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  So he will be honored. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=214.36s)]
*  The name Fort Bragg is back. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=215.56s)]
*  So now soldiers for decades who have served there can say I served in Fort Bragg. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=216.96s)]
*  They kept the old signage. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=222.16s)]
*  Yeah, otherwise the garage. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=224.16s)]
*  Otherwise, the sign guys making a fortune. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=225.96s)]
*  Hopefully didn't throw it out. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=227.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  Lukas, just real quick on another note. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=229.76s)]
*  I think most of the talk is going to be about Ukraine, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=231.56s)]
*  About the aid. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=234.16s)]
*  And now it's going to be I want this aid across. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=235.16s)]
*  We're going to get into talks, get to hear what they think the holdup is and find out [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=237.56s)]
*  what's really going on the battlefield. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=242.76s)]
*  If there's no question, Brian, we just talked to officials aboard the C-17 here on the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=246.16s)]
*  ground about the Ukraine aid. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=250.66s)]
*  We're told the aid to Ukraine is still going. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  There's something on maybe a decision coming up about another future package. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=254.36s)]
*  There's no question at the Munich Security Conference. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=258.56s)]
*  It's notable that the defense secretary is not attending that, but the Munich Security [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=261.16s)]
*  Conference or Vice President JD Vance will be going later this week here in Germany. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=264.56s)]
*  There's no question Ukraine is on the table. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  Ukraine President Zelensky is going to attend and the Trump administration. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=271.16s)]
*  We've heard the want to end this war and you know remains to be seen how that's going [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=274.06s)]
*  to happen. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=278.76s)]
*  You know, remember Brian last time there was a Munich agreement didn't work out so well [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=279.16s)]
*  in history. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=282.86s)]

*  It's great to get a report from a general and I'm sure they're competent and good. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=355.86s)]
*  But when you sit down and talk to people and you say I'm one of you about your age a little [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=359.66s)]
*  bit older what's happening in the field? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you feel like the communications good? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=365.96000000000004s)]

*  The school is okay with for you people that are going to school on base and what if they've [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=369.76s)]
*  told you enough advanced when they're going to deploy you into Iraq or over to Syria and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=374.66s)]
*  if you're going to pull out of Syria, I wouldn't be surprised if there was a trip over there [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=379.26s)]
*  to find out those 900 which is actually 1700 those 900 in Syria like what what kind of [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=382.86s)]
*  threat are you under who's going to control that prison of Isis fighters? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=389.06s)]
*  If we pull out so instead of getting report and a promise he gets to see face to face. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=392.96s)]
*  I think he's going to be so active. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=398.35999999999996s)]
*  That's also going to help the holistic recruiting because you've got a secretary of defense [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  who cares about the person. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=404.76s)]
*  Well Brian I saw that in action with the sector defense last week. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=406.06s)]
*  There was many a time that he has the generals in there and he has the rank and file that's [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=409.56s)]
*  in there. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=413.65999999999997s)]
*  He would meet with the generals right they would have classified unclassified meeting [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=414.46s)]
*  but then he would kick him out and he wanted to talk directly with the servicemen and women [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=418.35999999999996s)]
*  E7 and below so he can get an unfiltered view and they felt comfortable talking with [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=422.86s)]
*  him. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=428.76s)]
*  He's there this morning working out with them. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=429.76s)]
*  All of this is going to not only boost morale but the recruitment as well and I think that's [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=431.26s)]
*  the big thing. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=436.86s)]
*  We need more warfighters right now. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=437.86s)]
*  Right and also remember what Donald Trump ran on and what he talked about around the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=439.76s)]
*  inauguration so look for Pete to also discuss with the troops over there the fact that Donald [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=445.06s)]
*  Trump has wanted to reduce our footprint in Europe by 20,000. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=450.56s)]
*  He wants to bring 20,000 American soldiers home. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=455.26s)]
*  The other thing is Trump has said in the past that he's going to demand a subsidy from our [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=458.35999999999996s)]
*  European partners. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=463.46s)]
*  In other words whatever troops are left that work for the United States the people in Europe [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=465.06s)]
*  are going to have to pay for it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=471.26s)]
*  So look for that to be part of their fair share. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=472.96s)]
*  Just to build on what you said Richard Haas over the weekend you know like everyone likes [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=475.65999999999997s)]
*  to criticize Trump's unorthodox foreign policy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=479.56s)]
*  He said I like the Europe thing. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=482.16s)]
*  He said because the only thing that's going to get them to start spending money on defense [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=484.06s)]
*  is to know that America will not be sitting there watching their back. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=487.76s)]
*  The other thing you wave in is if Ukraine falls to Russia we're going to have to put [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=491.56s)]
*  so much more money in to have more troops and more fortifications in around the other [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=496.66s)]
*  NATO neighbor other NATO neighbors especially the Baltics. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=501.96s)]
*  It's going to cost everybody more money. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=506.56s)]
*  That's why it's important for Ukraine to hold. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=508.92s)]
*  Yeah and on defense spending that's something that Donald Trump brought up with Brett Baer [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=510.92s)]
*  during their interview when it comes to Canada even. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=514.16s)]
*  He said that Canada spends the lowest amount of NATO in defense spending because they assume [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=516.46s)]
*  that America is going to protect them which of course we would. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=520.52s)]
*  But he said that's one of the things that grinds his gears. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  He just gets under his skin and says you got to pay your fair share or become a 50 per [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=526.52s)]
*  state which is very unique. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  If he pulls out 20,000 suddenly the Europeans are going okay we're going to have to do [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=534.02s)]
*  more. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=538.88s)]
*  And that's the point. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=539.88s)]
*  Poland really wants more troops. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=540.88s)]
*  They'll even name the base after him. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=542.16s)]
*  We like it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=543.96s)]
*  Because if you would build a base in Poland well name it after you. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=544.96s)]
*  That's good. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=548.92s)]
*  They're smart. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=549.92s)]
*  That's a good move. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=550.92s)]
*  They understand. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=551.92s)]
*  They understand who they're negotiating with. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=552.92s)]
*  It wouldn't be the first Trump name on a building. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=553.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=554.92s)]
*  You wouldn't have to pay for it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=555.92s)]
*  Overseas in Poland. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaJ23mWRwI&t=556.92s)]
