# Crockett put on BLAST for downplaying illegal immigration: 'Mind-boggling'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k)
*  So Texas Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett calling out Republicans doing a hearing about sanctuary cities claiming they're being selective on their issues. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=0.0s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=9.0s)]
*  They love to cherry pick, but they don't want to talk about white supremacy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=10.0s)]
*  I don't know how many hearings we gonna have about the fact that there's been this one immigrant that killed this one person. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=13.0s)]
*  And no, I'm not excusing any killings by them or white supremacists, but they haven't had these hearings. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=19.0s)]
*  Here to react is Patty Moran, the mother of Rachel Moran, who was killed by an illegal immigrant in 2023. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=25.0s)]
*  You know, Patty, every time I hear these passionate speeches, when I ever I see them blocking ice and beating up on ice when they're trying to get criminal migrants officer, I think of you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=31.0s)]
*  And where was the passion for you? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=44.0s)]
*  Yeah, they they have an agenda and it seems to the American people that that agenda is being funded by the cartel, Iran, liberal elitist. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=48.0s)]
*  I mean, who else would fund such a crazy thing where they would say, you know, the American citizen is not as important as an illegal immigrant, a criminal illegal immigrant. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=62.0s)]
*  It's just it's mind boggling to me. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=77.0s)]
*  Patty, were there any marches protests when your daughter was murdered and cold blood? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=81.0s)]
*  The people filled the streets nationwide. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=87.0s)]
*  No, no. You know, I find it really fascinating. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=93.0s)]
*  One of the things that Crockett said was that President Trump is spending millions of dollars to protect American citizens, to send in ICE and the National Guard to protect American citizens. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=99.0s)]
*  But she forgot to say that these riots are being funded. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=115.0s)]
*  They're well organized. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=120.0s)]
*  And she forgot to say that these sanctuary cities and states are spending billions of dollars to freely give things to illegal immigrants that the American citizen does not receive. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=123.0s)]
*  And then to have all these protests for illegal immigrants, they're not even American citizens, while completely ignoring or at minimal just acknowledging sometimes the name, sometimes not the American citizens that are dying, the children that are being raped, the people that are being burnt alive, the people that are being cut up with machetes or murdered and strangled. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=138.0s)]
*  They're not acknowledging them at all. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=166.0s)]
*  Patty, I know the president has acknowledged your family. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=169.0s)]
*  He's also acknowledged the issue at the border. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=172.0s)]
*  And you can see it with the numbers. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=174.0s)]
*  We can put it up on the screen right there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=176.0s)]
*  Back in 2019, over 100,000 people for the month of April were crossing this border that same month in 2020. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=178.0s)]
*  Fifteen only 12,000 people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=186.0s)]
*  And these people aren't being catched and released as well. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=188.0s)]
*  And these are the people that we know about. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=192.0s)]
*  Patty, to the Democrats that are out there, what would you, if you were sitting in front of them, what would you tell them as they protest in the middle of the street for the illegal criminals in this country? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=194.0s)]
*  I would say go live in the other country because obviously you have no concern or you have no, you don't care about the people that you're going to kill. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=207.0s)]
*  You don't care about this country. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=222.0s)]
*  The American people see that the Democrat Party and the liberals have no concern for the American people, for the everyday American citizen. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=223.0s)]
*  They only have concern for their agenda. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=233.0s)]
*  And that agenda is nothing more than to weaken and dismantle our country because they're funded by our enemies. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=236.0s)]
*  And the American people see that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=246.0s)]
*  Trump has got, I think, last poll I saw was 77% of the American people approve of what President Trump is doing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=248.0s)]
*  And they are not shocked, but so I can't even find a word to describe how they feel about the Democrat Party. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=257.0s)]
*  It's like it's absurd. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=270.0s)]
*  It's wrong. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=272.0s)]
*  They can't even remember your daughter's name, Rachel, but we will remember her every single day. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=273.0s)]
*  Patty, thank you so much for joining the program this morning. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=277.0s)]
*  Thank you for inviting me. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=282.0s)]
*  I really appreciate being able to speak. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=283.0s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7-A-vQQ4k&t=286.0s)]
