# Trump drafting EO abolishing Department of Education: Report
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec)
*  So President Trump reportedly set to issue an executive order aimed at eliminating the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=0.0s)]
*  Department of Education as soon as today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Jackie Heinrich joins us now to tell us more. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=9.72s)]
*  Hey Jackie. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=12.76s)]
*  Good morning guys. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=13.76s)]
*  According to the Wall Street Journal, the president could sign that executive order [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=14.76s)]
*  as early as today, directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to quote, take all necessary [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=17.52s)]
*  steps to facilitate the closure of the education department based on the maximum extent appropriate [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=24.26s)]
*  and permitted by law. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=29.68s)]
*  It's something the president has been angling for since his first days in office. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=31.68s)]
*  Why nominate Linda McMahon to be the Education Department Secretary if you're going to get [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=37.76s)]
*  rid of the education department? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Because I told Linda, Linda, I hope you do a great job and put yourself out of a job. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  I want her to put herself out of a job, Education Department. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=49.84s)]
*  I want the states to run schools and I want Linda to put herself out of a job. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  McMahon reportedly signaled it was coming and an email to staff on Monday night right [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=58.68s)]
*  after her Senate confirmation saying she would send education back to the states. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=62.3s)]
*  But much of the department's programs are codified by law and Congress would have to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=66.8s)]
*  scrap the department with Democrats buying in to clear 60 votes in the Senate. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=71.12s)]
*  Betsy DeVos, Education Secretary in the president's first term, was not able to get it done. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=75.96s)]
*  Since then we had COVID and Americans eyes were open to just what an abject failure [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=83.1s)]
*  this federal agency has been at its mission. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  Shy of Congress actually dismantling and shutting down the department. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=93.41999999999999s)]
*  One of the most important ways to get power back to a more local level is to simply take [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=97.86s)]
*  the funds appropriated by Congress and block grant them back to the states. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=103.34s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reports some changes proposed by the Heritage Foundation could [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=108.66s)]
*  include moving the Civil Rights Division under the Department of Education over to DOJ and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=113.14s)]
*  also taking student loans and shifting them over to Treasury. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  So we'll see what happens guys. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=122.62s)]
*  Wow thanks so much Jackie. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=124.58s)]
*  So this was not unexpected but for Linda McMahon to get confirmed in a couple of days she decides [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=126.46s)]
*  she's going to wind it down. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=131.84s)]
*  So you need 60 votes in the Senate to get rid of it but in the meantime can you begin [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=133.38s)]
*  to thin out the herd of people that you have working for you? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=137.98s)]
*  Can you start to send the money to the states even if the education department stays there [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=142.66s)]
*  while the Senate debates? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=147.66s)]
*  I think if the president takes all of these kids that are around the country that are [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=149.17999999999998s)]
*  on this waiting list or cannot afford a quality education because they're in the failing district [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=153.22s)]
*  and he takes the money from the federal government and says listen I'm going to pay for you to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=158.42s)]
*  go to charter school. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=162.1s)]
*  The Democrats cannot object to this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=163.33999999999997s)]
*  If you object to parents sending their kids to a quality school, preventing the school [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=165.5s)]
*  to prison pipeline, I think it's just going to look bad and it just showed you that the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=171.9s)]
*  president will be common sense versus the Democratic party with the teachers unions. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=176.02s)]
*  Well I mean I know what your family did. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=180.18s)]
*  You lived in Texas, your parents moved so you could be in the best school district and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=181.86s)]
*  I know for New York City most of the people in New York City have no choice. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=186.72s)]
*  The schools are so bad. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=191.54s)]
*  in most of the neighborhoods you have to do private schools. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=193.73999999999998s)]
*  So it would be wonderful under school choice where Donald Trump says I'll give you the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=196.82s)]
*  money, let's say it's $40,000 per kid to go to school in New York City. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=201.42s)]
*  So I'll give you that money and you get school choice. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=206.26s)]
*  You can pay for a private school, it can go toward that, it can go toward whatever to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=208.42s)]
*  pay for your child's education so that the parents are in charge because if you live [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=212.74s)]
*  in a bad neighborhood, the schools are bad, you're stuck, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=216.26s)]
*  The teachers unions want you stuck because they don't want their positions to go away [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=220.14s)]
*  and they don't, there's a, for example, there's money for charter schools to open up all throughout [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=225.73999999999998s)]
*  the city. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=230.1s)]
*  What they do, these Democratic governors squeeze them, they make them over crowded, make them [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=231.1s)]
*  hard to get into, make it a lottery system so they don't open up even though they have [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=234.98s)]
*  the classrooms, they have the buildings, they still don't open it up. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=238.98s)]
*  So you could say you should do it and feel the pressure but Democrats don't feel the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=242.7s)]
*  pressure. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=245.77999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, we support teachers as well. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=246.77999999999997s)]
*  We want quality teachers, we want teachers to get raises as well. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=249.5s)]
*  But we gotta stop, something is going wrong in our education system and I think it's the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=253.26s)]
*  lack of competition. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=257.26s)]
*  I think the competition needs to happen. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=258.7s)]
*  If a school is failing, why should we keep it open? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=260.58s)]
*  We're failing our kids and a lot of those kids are ending up in prison and I just don't [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=264.38s)]
*  think that's what's right for society. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIo3ISAWec&t=268.5s)]
