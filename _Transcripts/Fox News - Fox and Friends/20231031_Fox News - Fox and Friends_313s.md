# Suspected drone infiltrations into Israeli airspace
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A)
*  This is a live look right now at the ruins along the Israel-Gaza border. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=0.0s)]
*  Right now the IDF is pushing deeper into Hamas-controlled territory. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=6.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, overnight Israeli forces killed a commander who directed portions of the major [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=10.44s)]
*  attacks on October 7th. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=16.22s)]
*  Meanwhile, the IDF is hunting down Hamas targets inside their 300-mile tunnel network. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=18.32s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live on the ground in southern Israel with the latest. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=25.0s)]
*  Trey. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=28.04s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=29.04s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=31.28s)]
*  I do want to start with some breaking news. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=32.28s)]
*  Two separate times this morning there have been suspected drone infiltrations into Israeli [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=33.68s)]
*  airspace in the southern part of the country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=39.14s)]
*  Israeli media is reporting these were drones likely fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=42.32s)]
*  came toward Israel through the Red Sea. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=47.08s)]
*  Here along the southern border between Israel and Gaza, the fighting continues. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  I do want to just show you the scene behind me as we talk here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=53.92s)]
*  You can see a lot of activity in the ruins of the northern part of Gaza. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=56.88s)]
*  We do understand, according to Hamas, the group in control of the strip, that their [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  Al Qassam Brigade, the main military wing of Hamas, has been engaging Israeli forces [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=65.5s)]
*  that are currently operating in the strip there that you see. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=70.48s)]
*  Yesterday we saw those Israeli tanks that were going back and forth along the border. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=73.6s)]
*  We also have some information from the Israeli military that we can't reveal yet about the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=77.88s)]
*  battles that took place overnight. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=82.28s)]
*  But as that information becomes on the record, we will bring it to you later in the day. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=84.19999999999999s)]
*  All of this comes as we are learning more about the hostages being held inside Gaza. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=88.88s)]
*  Two hundred and forty people. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  That does not include the four that have been released to American citizens and to Israeli [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=95.06s)]
*  citizens. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=99.46s)]
*  And of course, that Israeli soldier that was rescued just yesterday as part of the ongoing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=100.6s)]
*  Israeli efforts inside the strip. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  We're talking about private Ori Megadish, who was freed from captivity. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=108.42s)]
*  She was originally taken on October 7th from the Naholoz base that sits along the border [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=113.0s)]
*  with Gaza. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=117.5s)]
*  The Israelis say she is in good condition and that she was able to meet with her family [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=118.5s)]
*  just yesterday. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=122.9s)]
*  This does come as the Israelis say they conducted a strike against one specific commander from [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=124.44s)]
*  Hamas in the northern part of the Gaza strip. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=129.9s)]
*  We're talking about Nassim Abu Ajina, who directed one of the attacks against Israeli [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=132.28s)]
*  civilians on October 7th, yet another member of Hamas that has been taken out by Israeli [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=137.17999999999998s)]
*  forces. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=142.33999999999997s)]
*  As they do tell Fox News, the efforts are focused around trying to destroy Hamas capabilities [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=143.33999999999997s)]
*  and the leadership command inside Gaza. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=148.7s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=151.05999999999997s)]
*  Hey, Trey, you did report earlier that there were high level Israeli officials in Doha [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=152.05999999999997s)]
*  trying to work with these to get the hostages out. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=157.17999999999998s)]
*  Does that have anything to do with the rescue that the IDF pulled off? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=160.98s)]
*  So we understand there are two separate issues. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=167.26s)]
*  The Israelis tell Fox that this was a joint effort to save this private who was captured [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=170.54s)]
*  on October 7th. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=176.17999999999998s)]
*  And this effort had to do with the Shin Bet, Israel's intelligence service, and also the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=178.22s)]
*  army on the ground. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=183.26s)]
*  They were clearly acting on specific intelligence. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=184.29999999999998s)]
*  They were able to conduct this raid and rescue the private that was being held. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=186.84s)]
*  And we actually saw this photo of her with her family yesterday. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  And you could just see the relief on their faces. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=194.58s)]
*  They had their daughter back home after so many weeks of waiting with no information, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=196.9s)]
*  whether she was alive or dead. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=201.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=203.22000000000003s)]
*  And Trey, I can tell you're being cagey about not revealing operational details. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=204.22000000000003s)]
*  But was she in a tunnel? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=208.86s)]
*  Because if she was in a tunnel, she's going to be able to tell the IDF, okay, I was in [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=210.94s)]
*  this tunnel and I saw this stuff and this is how they operate. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=215.10000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=221.58s)]
*  I'm very careful with the details here and I'll tell you why. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=222.58s)]
*  This morning I met again in Tel Aviv with Israel's Defense Minister, Yoav Galant. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=225.18s)]
*  And we talked about this specific situation and also the battles that are taking place [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=230.34s)]
*  behind me inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  The majority of our conversation with a small group of journalists was off the record. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=236.58s)]
*  I'm working to get some of that information on the record so I can bring it to you next [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=240.74s)]
*  hour. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=244.54000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  But very sensitive details that we're talking about and I will effort to get them approved [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=246.54000000000002s)]
*  and able to bring them to you later today. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=249.66000000000003s)]
*  I understand. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=252.3s)]
*  Trey, you've covered a lot of wars. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=253.3s)]
*  You've been on the ground for a lot of conflicts. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  Is it fair to say the invasion has started? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=257.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=260.94s)]
*  This is the second stage of this war. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=263.78s)]
*  It was something that was part of that conversation we had today trying to get clarity on whether [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=266.62s)]
*  this is all part of an expanded raid or whether or not the Israeli forces are operating inside [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=270.65999999999997s)]
*  the Gaza Strip and intend to stay there. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=276.5s)]
*  I have information on that, but I just have to wait to give it to you until we can get [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=278.82s)]
*  this cleared by Israeli censors and ensure that we're not giving away any Israeli positions. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=282.14s)]
*  I do want to just let you know right now, my producer is telling me that sirens are [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  sounding in Metulla. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=290.58s)]
*  Metulla is in northern Israel, an indication that the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=292.26s)]
*  is once again getting involved in this fight and firing on Israeli troops in the north. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=297.1s)]
*  It gives you a sense of just how active the southern and northern front is in this conflict. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=301.86s)]
*  Iranian proxies not just in Gaza but also in southern Lebanon engaging in this fight. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=306.26s)]
*  Alright Trey, thank you so much. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXtt8fPQ1A&t=310.74s)]
