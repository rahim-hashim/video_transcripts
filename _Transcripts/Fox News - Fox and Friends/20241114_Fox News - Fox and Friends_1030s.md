# Dems' 'epic failure': Republicans CLINCH trifecta after keeping control of the House
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64)
*  All right, first up, Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the hat trick. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=4.88s)]
*  Republicans have officially retained control of the House, securing a governing trifecta [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  late last night. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  The latest races were called as president-elect Donald Trump shakes things up with another [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=13.6s)]
*  unexpected cabinet pick, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz as attorney general. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  We have live team coverage now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=23.12s)]
*  We got Mark Meredith in West Palm, Florida on the latest Trump picks, but we begin with [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=24.52s)]
*  Griff Jenkins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=28.92s)]
*  I like him better. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=29.92s)]
*  He's on the Republican sweep in Washington. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=30.92s)]
*  Griff sorry, and hopefully Mark didn't hear that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=33.56s)]
*  Mark's a good guy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=35.96s)]
*  Good morning guys. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=37.440000000000005s)]
*  Look, the American people have clearly spoken in a red wave will sweep into Washington [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=38.44s)]
*  now giving Republicans all three pillars of power. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=42.28s)]
*  Something not seen by the way since 2017 when Trump first took power. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=45.74s)]
*  Now look at the balance of power. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  You can see 218 to 208 as you show, but there's a handful of races yet to be called, meaning [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=51.6s)]
*  the majority could grow. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=56.78s)]
*  Notwithstanding Matt Gaetz is resignation yesterday. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=58.300000000000004s)]
*  Speaker Johnson also winning unanimous support for another term as the top House Republican. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=62.24s)]
*  Now the trifecta was clinched after the race was called in Arizona for Republican Juan [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  Siscamani defeating Democrat Kirsten Engel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=72.58s)]
*  It came on the heels of GOP incumbent Ken Calvert defeating Democrat challenger Will [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=76.12s)]
*  Rollins in California's 41st district. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=81.06s)]
*  Meanwhile in the Senate, Mitch McConnell's longtime deputy John Thune will be the next [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=84.54s)]
*  majority leader ready to help deliver on president elect Trump's vision. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=88.74000000000001s)]
*  We are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=96.42s)]
*  House to enact president Trump's agenda. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=99.34s)]
*  We have a mandate from the American people, a mandate not only to clean up the mess left [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=103.94s)]
*  by the high Biden Harris Schumer agenda, but also to deliver on president Trump's priorities. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=109.68s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  The majorities in both chambers are small, meaning Republicans won't have much margin [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  for error and it could be a tightrope walking act at times. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=122.12s)]
*  It'll be interesting to watch guys. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  So Griff, just this is a math question and I know none of us are very good at math, but [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=128.74s)]
*  with that 218, is one of those 218 still Matt Gaetz because he called a quits yesterday? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=134.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  218 to 208, but Gaetz resigning his seat. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  We're seeing Florida Governor DeSantis quickly moving and Speaker Johnson said he talked [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=146.72000000000003s)]
*  with DeSantis about trying to fill that seat and Gaetz's district is a very red district, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  so you would assume that would be filled by a Republican. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=157.96s)]
*  But we still have about a half a dozen races still yet to be called, meaning that House [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=162.24s)]
*  majority could grow, making the Gaetz resignation not that significant. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=166.76s)]
*  Alright, thank you, Griff. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=171.0s)]
*  Thank you, Sarah. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=172.48s)]
*  Speaker Johnson said that under Florida law, they have an eight week period to fill that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=173.48s)]
*  seat and he's already talked to Ron DeSantis. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=177.0s)]
*  Ron DeSantis, he says in Italy, they're going to talk today, this morning. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=178.88s)]
*  He said the clock has started, but they might be able to fill that seat by January 3rd. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  It's pretty amazing what is taking place. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, the Senate is going to be up to 53 as soon as McCormick gets done with Casey. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=188.76s)]
*  And then you have on the House side, after all the chaos almost a year ago, with the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  flipping where Matt Gaetz led an insurgency to flip Kevin McCarthy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=197.28s)]
*  They couldn't pick anyone. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=201.28s)]
*  They talked to the Chaos Caucus. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=202.72s)]
*  They want to head and flip more seats than the Democrats. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=204.76s)]
*  So he's still going to be in a slight margin, slight advantage, but what an epic fail by [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=212.2s)]
*  McKean-Jeffrey says, hey, this is on me. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=213.2s)]
*  I was unable to do it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  They had more money. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=216.2s)]
*  They had more time. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=217.56s)]
*  And they had this young leader that they said was going to be their future, unable to flip [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=223.88s)]
*  So I'm very curious to see how quick Elise Stefanik gets filled, how quick they fill [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=224.88s)]
*  up for Congressman, oh yeah, for Matt Gaetz, as well as, as well as Congressman, Florida [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=229.16s)]
*  Congressman is now going to be National Security Advisor. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=237.16s)]
*  Mike Waltz. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=240.04s)]
*  So Mike Waltz, he called right away and told the speaker, look, I'm probably going to be [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=241.04s)]
*  tapped for something. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=244.12s)]
*  Get lined up, get it lined up. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  And again, in big, you're seeing time for Governor DeSantis go to Italy because there's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=246.8s)]
*  a lot for him to do. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, he actually released a statement about maybe an hour ago on X and he said that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  he's already notified the secretary of state to start the process. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=257.24s)]
*  So he may be out of the country, but the effective leader that he is, he's already on it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=260.1s)]
*  But I think we got to take a moment to pause to see what the country has done right now. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=266.36s)]
*  They're telling the Republicans, we're going to give you a shot for two years. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=271.12s)]
*  If the American people wanted divided government, they would have given divided government. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  This is a mandate for the president's agenda. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=279.4s)]
*  Apparently it was more relatable to the people in their pain. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  And so the Republicans have to get to work now. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=286.32s)]
*  You're absolutely right, Lawrence. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=288.56s)]
*  And for the longest time, while publicly the people in the House said, you know, Republicans [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  are going to win. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=295.44s)]
*  The Democrats were out raising them, fundraising them. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=297.44s)]
*  They had a lot more dough. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=301.36s)]
*  And so it was right up until the very end that we knew what was going on. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=302.62s)]
*  Ultimately, there are still nine seats to be determined. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=308.08s)]
*  But I read a couple of things about the analysis of this trifecta. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=311.24s)]
*  And that is there are so few competitive seats. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=316.7s)]
*  Keep in mind, there are 435 seats in the House of Representatives. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=319.48s)]
*  Only about 45 are truly competitive, but only about a dozen are true battleground districts [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=324.12s)]
*  on both sides. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=330.56s)]
*  And so those days when you would see a 30 seat majority for one of the parties for right [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=332.0s)]
*  now, that's nowhere to be found. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=337.04s)]
*  And that is why it is so important for Mike Johnson to be able to manage that very little [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=338.88s)]
*  sliver of a majority. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=344.56s)]
*  There's no longer a single seat motion of AK. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=346.16s)]
*  It is now nine seats. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=348.32s)]
*  So they have to, so no longer some selfish person is going to stand up and go, I don't [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=350.56s)]
*  like the speaker anymore. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=357.2s)]
*  Also Speaker Johnson, he unanimously was approved and Trump backed him as well. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=359.04s)]
*  The last time that we had this trifecta was right after Trump won in 2016. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=363.88s)]
*  So it was 2017, 18 and 19. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=367.92s)]
*  And that's when the tax cuts happened, the Jobs Act was signed, the Federal Criminal [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=370.32s)]
*  Justice Reform Bill was signed, which is the first stepped act. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=374.12s)]
*  And then Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were confirmed. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=377.08s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=380.64s)]
*  And then we'll keep you up to date on how this goes and when those other races are decided. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=381.64s)]
*  Now, as we mentioned, Matt Gaetz is the third House member to be nominated for a role in [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=385.44s)]
*  Donald Trump's upcoming administration, along with Elise Stefanik and Michael Waltz, House [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=390.6s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson, jokingly telling Donald Trump to knock it off. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=394.92s)]
*  I have begged and pleaded with the new president enough already. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=400.52s)]
*  Because our numbers are small. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=404.72s)]
*  We are going to have the majority. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=406.52s)]
*  We're celebrating that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=407.56s)]
*  And also the president said, leave Speaker Johnson in place. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=409.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=413.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=414.12s)]
*  Mark Meredith is in West Palm Beach with the latest. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=415.12s)]
*  Hey, Mark. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=416.12s)]
*  Ainsley and friends, good morning to you guys. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=417.12s)]
*  President-elect Trump has shocked both Washington and the world once again by announcing he [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=420.32s)]
*  wants Matt Gaetz, the Florida congressman who resigned from the House just yesterday [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=424.52s)]
*  to be his next attorney general. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=428.6s)]
*  Gaetz rose to power back in 2016, representing Florida's Western panhandle. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=430.92s)]
*  He has been a staunch supporter of Trump, but he's had some controversy of his own. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=435.52s)]
*  The House Ethics Committee was investigating allegations Gaetz was part of a scheme tied [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=439.88s)]
*  to a sex trafficking of a minor. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=445.88s)]
*  Now, Gaetz has long denied these allegations, and last year the Justice Department ended [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=447.76s)]
*  its probe of the matter. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=452.44s)]
*  Trump says he wants Gaetz because Matt will end weaponized government, protect our borders, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=453.88s)]
*  dismantle criminal organizations, and restore America's badly shattered faith and confidence [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=458.12s)]
*  in the Justice Department. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=462.68s)]
*  Now Gaetz, as you guys talked about, resigned from Congress, and the decision will end the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=464.4s)]
*  ethics investigation. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=467.84s)]
*  And now, as far as we know, no report is going to be issued, but lawmakers are likely to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=469.52s)]
*  dig deeper during any upcoming confirmation hearing. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=473.79999999999995s)]
*  Just kind of like a god tier kind of trolling, just to trigger a meltdown. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=479.47999999999996s)]
*  I think what we can tell you right now is that we always allow the president to have [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=484.47999999999996s)]
*  the benefit of the doubt, but we still have to do our role in terms of due diligence. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=488.88s)]
*  It's a somewhat interesting pick. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=494.32s)]
*  We'll have to see how that all unfolds. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=495.32s)]
*  There's another nominee also from Florida likely to have a much easier time getting [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=500.32s)]
*  confirmed, and that's Florida Senator Mark Garubio, who Trump wants to be Secretary of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=503.28s)]
*  State. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=507.12s)]
*  Trump writing he will be a strong advocate for our nation, a true friend to our allies, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=508.12s)]
*  and a fearless warrior who will never back down to our adversaries. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=512.08s)]
*  Also new, Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic Hawaii congressman turned Republican Trump [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=515.88s)]
*  supporter, will be the nominee for director of national intelligence. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=519.84s)]
*  Trump says Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=523.96s)]
*  our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights and securing peace through [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=527.84s)]
*  strength. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=532.64s)]
*  Talked a little bit about the work that needs to be done, and I was grateful and honored [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=533.64s)]
*  to accept President Trump's offer to serve our country and support his objective to defend [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  the safety, security and freedom of the American people. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=544.76s)]
*  It's been fascinating to see how quickly some of these big cabinet posts have been announced, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=550.68s)]
*  but there are still a few others we are waiting for, including members of the economic team, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=553.68s)]
*  including secretaries of treasury and commerce. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=557.76s)]
*  So we'll wait to see if that happens as the sun rises here in Florida. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=560.08s)]
*  Ainsley, Steve, Brian and Lawrence, back to you. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=563.0s)]
*  Matt Gates was not on anybody's bingo card. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=565.4399999999999s)]
*  I got a quick question for you though, Mark, and that is this. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=567.6s)]
*  Because he resigned, the ethics report will not officially be released. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=572.08s)]
*  It was supposed to come out within a week. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=575.76s)]
*  But Matt Gates does not have a lot of friends in the House, and it could leak, right? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=578.48s)]
*  Oh, it absolutely could leak. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=585.76s)]
*  And it was interesting, even this morning, the former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, he [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=588.56s)]
*  was on Bloomberg, I think he was doing an interview while in Singapore, and he said [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=592.08s)]
*  he didn't believe that Gates would get confirmed. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=595.52s)]
*  But you just mentioned something, Steve, you go, well, Gates may not have a lot of friends [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=598.72s)]
*  in the House, but he's got a friend who's going to be here at Mar-a-Lago and soon be [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=601.4s)]
*  in the White House, and that may be what matters the most. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=604.76s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=608.48s)]
*  Power can change a lot of things, so perhaps Gates all of a sudden has a lot of new friends [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=609.48s)]
*  within the coming days, but he says he's very excited for this opportunity. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=613.4s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=616.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=617.72s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=618.72s)]
*  Thanks, Mark. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=619.72s)]
*  So there's a lot of people digging in. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=620.72s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal said it's a bad choice. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=621.72s)]
*  An unnamed Republican said he's never going to get confirmed. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=622.96s)]
*  He's got to get through the Judiciary Committee, can't lose any Republican votes. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=625.64s)]
*  But Lisa Murkowski is somebody who says he's not a serious candidate. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=630.08s)]
*  And Joni Ernst said he's got a lot of work cut out for him, which is a nice way of saying, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=633.68s)]
*  you got to sell me on your background. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=637.88s)]
*  So Ainsley, I had a lot of, I would say, spirited conversations last night talking about this [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=639.68s)]
*  pick. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=645.5999999999999s)]
*  The view from the Trump camp is that they wanted disruption in the Department of Justice. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=646.5999999999999s)]
*  They got it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=651.52s)]
*  Check. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=652.52s)]
*  And they wanted someone that was also targeted, they say, by the Department of Justice. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=653.52s)]
*  We all talk about what this health ethics committee was going to present, but also there [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=659.44s)]
*  was a Department of Justice investigation that was dropped against him. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=664.24s)]
*  And so they're saying that the president wants to go all in and that he deserves a shot to [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=667.84s)]
*  go through the process. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=673.84s)]
*  The problem is that there are some people within the Senate that have already made it [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=675.46s)]
*  very clear that they're not going to vote for him. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=679.8800000000001s)]
*  Lindsey Graham is of the opinion, let him go through the process, let's flush through [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=682.0400000000001s)]
*  his resume and then make a decision. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=685.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's fair. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=688.08s)]
*  You know, what we have heard, though, over the last couple of weeks is the president, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=689.08s)]
*  the new incoming president, Donald Trump, the former president, has said he would like [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=692.76s)]
*  to see a lot of his picks go through the recess nomination or the recess process, essentially [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=696.54s)]
*  where you could bypass the nomination by essentially appointing somebody when the House and the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=702.7s)]
*  Senate are in recess. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=709.6s)]
*  John Thune said yesterday to an outlet from South Dakota, his home state, that he would [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  prefer to go through the old fashioned way with the confirmation hearings. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=716.68s)]
*  But he is open to recess appointments. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=720.9s)]
*  The question is, with a recess appointment, you need the assistance of the Democrats and [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=723.4799999999999s)]
*  the Democrats are going to be squarely against Mr. Gates. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=728.4399999999999s)]
*  And he's not going to get paid. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=731.04s)]
*  The ethics investigation, they were saying what was going to be released was highly damaging. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=732.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=736.0799999999999s)]
*  But maybe we won't know unless there is looking. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=737.0799999999999s)]
*  So what is what is Matt Matt Gates's resume? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=739.2399999999999s)]
*  So he served on the House Judiciary Committee. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=742.0799999999999s)]
*  He led the charge. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=744.92s)]
*  In December, was it last year to oust Kevin McCarthy last year as House Speaker. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=745.9599999999999s)]
*  He served as the adviser to Donald Trump during this latest campaign and helped him prep for [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=750.4599999999999s)]
*  the Kamala Harris debate. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=755.8399999999999s)]
*  And he was under the House Ethics Committee investigation that we've been talking about [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=757.4799999999999s)]
*  as a G. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=762.0799999999999s)]
*  Obviously, you have to be an attorney. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=763.0799999999999s)]
*  And he went to law school at William & Mary. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=764.0799999999999s)]
*  And one other thing is Lee, Matt Gates flew to Washington yesterday with Donald Trump [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=765.7199999999999s)]
*  on Trump Force One. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=771.0999999999999s)]
*  And he's also very close to Suzy Wiles. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=772.56s)]
*  She had him help Donald Trump do the debate prep, which was on your list. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=775.28s)]
*  So the Wall Street Journal writes, yeah, he got a degree from William & Mary, but it might [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=779.48s)]
*  as well be a doctorate in outrage theater. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=782.8399999999999s)]
*  He's a performer and provocateur. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=785.1999999999999s)]
*  And his view is that the more explosions he can cause, the more attention he can get, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=786.9599999999999s)]
*  it's impossible to get canceled if you're on every channel. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=791.48s)]
*  If you aren't making news, you aren't governing. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=794.68s)]
*  That's his philosophy. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=797.76s)]
*  And that's what, you know, he's got to be quick on his feet and have an answer to a [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=798.9s)]
*  Because if he can't get out of committee, he can't get to a general. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=803.88s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=806.4000000000001s)]
*  There's two things here. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=808.8000000000001s)]
*  If you're going to say that he's not the person, right, if you're going to attack him, then [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=810.24s)]
*  it has to be on his credentials. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=815.5200000000001s)]
*  Because if we attack the firebrand, that is what the Trump base, that's what the former [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=818.2s)]
*  president wants. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=822.72s)]
*  The second thing is to Steve's point, if they leak the documents of what was happening in [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=824.4200000000001s)]
*  that investigation, especially after the Department of Justice dismissed the charges [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=830.96s)]
*  against him, that's not going to be very good as it relates to the case if you don't want [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=835.6s)]
*  him because it only is going to make people that are within his camp say, see the system [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=841.32s)]
*  is attacking him yet again, even though the Department of Justice said there's not a case [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=846.94s)]
*  here. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=852.24s)]
*  So it's the beginning of the Murkowski Collins. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=853.24s)]
*  Murkowski Collins are going to be moderate on everything and it'll be they'll they're [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=855.2800000000001s)]
*  very comfortable pushing back on Trump. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=859.7199999999999s)]
*  So it's official Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, Tulsi Gabbard, director of national [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=862.1999999999999s)]
*  intelligence. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=866.4799999999999s)]
*  This is interesting. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=867.4799999999999s)]
*  The rise of the millennials. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=868.4799999999999s)]
*  This was from Courtney Holland. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=870.0s)]
*  She put this out on on X. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=871.3s)]
*  OK, did you want to know? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=873.92s)]
*  I was just going to say there's her there's Tulsi's resume. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=876.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=879.52s)]
*  So the rise of the millennials, Vivek, 39 years old, Elise Stefanik, 40 years old, JD [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=880.52s)]
*  Vance, 40, Matt Gaetz, 42, Tulsi Gabbard, 43. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=885.16s)]
*  When Donald Trump took office in 2016, 17, everyone was older. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=888.8399999999999s)]
*  Everyone was much older. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=894.52s)]
*  So this is interesting. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=895.88s)]
*  This is a new generation. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=897.16s)]
*  I will say that we have to appreciate the balance of the administration right now. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=898.68s)]
*  You got firebrands and you have more traditional Republicans that are there still America first. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=902.76s)]
*  So, for example, you got Michael Waltz is going to be national security adviser. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=908.4399999999999s)]
*  You got Marco Rubio, who's the secretary of state. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=911.64s)]
*  And then you have Pete Hexer as the defense. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=914.76s)]
*  One is going to be a firebrand that is going to disrupt the military in a way that some [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=917.4s)]
*  people are not prepared for yet. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=922.52s)]
*  But again, this is something that the former president campaigned on. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=924.76s)]
*  He's going to get rid of the wokeness there. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=928.96s)]
*  And so there's a balance of pros he learned diplomat versus from the first administration. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=930.96s)]
*  Like, I need people that I know are staunch conservatives. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=936.64s)]
*  There's a there's a time for compromise. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=939.84s)]
*  And then there's a time to shake things up. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=942.6800000000001s)]
*  Right. I don't think you're a conservative. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=946.28s)]
*  I think it is people that are thinkers but are not going to stand in the back. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=948.12s)]
*  And all the other thing is, do you notice we have these announcements going here? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=953.9599999999999s)]
*  First Cuban, first woman, first Hawaiian. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=957.04s)]
*  All we have is person. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=960.5999999999999s)]
*  That's what I want to get back to. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=962.48s)]
*  Just like, you know, I guess I guess Suzy Wiles broke the mold. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=963.92s)]
*  I guess, you know, a Cuban-American whose dad was born in communism escaped to freedom. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=966.88s)]
*  That's a story. But you know what's more important? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=971.0799999999999s)]
*  Who Marco Rubio is like, what his philosophy is. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=973.3199999999999s)]
*  I just love the fact that we're just seeing the best people and we don't have to look at their heritage and their DNA [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=975.6s)]
*  and find out if they used to be a woman or if they, you know, are, you know, I think what their sexuality is. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=981.0400000000001s)]
*  That's what Joe Biden. I never get Joe Biden told Joe Manchin. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=987.88s)]
*  Joe Manchin says, what are you doing, Joe? You're hiring all these left wingers. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=991.28s)]
*  He goes, it's the most diverse cabinet ever. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=994.12s)]
*  And the answer, Joe Manchin is so. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=997.44s)]
*  Are they going to do what you need to be done? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=1000.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, and going in, Joe Biden wanted it to be the most diverse cabinet ever, and he got that. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=1002.16s)]
*  That's why Donald Trump wants to shake everything up in Washington. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=1008.28s)]
*  And he's going to get it because he's got people who are like minded and who are going to be able to hit the ground running on the first day. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfM9U3MzZ64&t=1011.92s)]
