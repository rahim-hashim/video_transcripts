# Will Cain calls out the ‘ridiculous’ ways Washington is spending money
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M)
*  The new Department of Government efficiency led by Elon Musk and Vivek Gramaswamy is aiming to wipe out unnecessary government spending. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's some cuts that they could consider. Check this out. Over $500,000 from the National Institutes of Health awarded to Russian labs to study cats walking on treadmills. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=8.0s)]
*  How about $39 million to oversee DEI efforts? $50 million, I'm serious, to study monkeys testing how they performed while on meth and injecting them with female hormones. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=20.0s)]
*  $1.3 billion in checks sent by the federal government to people who have already passed away. And $7 billion wasted on empty federal buildings. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=32.0s)]
*  Now DOGE is beginning to recruit. They issued this tweet saying in part, quote, we need super high IQ small government revolutionaries willing to work 80 hours a week for unglamorous cost cutting jobs. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=42.0s)]
*  Here to discuss is CEO of the Watchdog, Open the Books, John Hart. Hey John, thanks for being with us this morning. Let's talk about DOGE. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=57.0s)]
*  We just walked through some of the more ridiculous ways the federal government spends money. But what we really want to know is can DOGE make significant percentage wise cuts to getting a more efficient federal government? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=66.0s)]
*  Yeah, well thanks for having me. The answer is absolutely. You know, this is a brand new commission, but this is already a movement. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=81.0s)]
*  The American people are demanding more control over their tax dollars and their own destiny because every dollar saved in Washington is a dream realized somewhere in America. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=88.0s)]
*  So what we've seen is for decades, politicians have been expanding federal agencies, but DOGE is about expanding your agency and your ability to pursue the American dream on your terms. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=97.0s)]
*  So what we've pointed out at Open the Books is we've built the biggest database of spending in history. We have 10 billion lines of code. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=107.0s)]
*  And you can very quickly get to two or three hundred billion dollars through some of the things you just pointed out. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=114.0s)]
*  We can go after things like duplication in the federal government, improper payments, Medicare fraud, getting rid of DEI. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=119.0s)]
*  We did some great reports on DEI and Department of Education, HHS. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=126.0s)]
*  Right. And so once you do that, then what I think Elon Musk and the Baker are going to point out are new efficiencies, ways to use technology like AI to take those savings much further. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=130.0s)]
*  And then once you win the support and trust of the American people, again, with this movement, this bottom up movement, you can begin to look at these bigger ticket items like entitlement spending that you really need to think about reforming to get at two trillion dollars. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=142.0s)]
*  Well, I want to share with the audience. You can take a look at the way that federal government spending has grown since I believe it since the 1960s up through today. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=155.0s)]
*  And it's just it's it's beyond inflationary. It is explosive. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=162.0s)]
*  You know, the vague, for example, has talked about things like the number of federal employees obviously being inefficient, over bloated. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=166.0s)]
*  But he's even talked about, like, you know, social security numbers, every other odd and even letting people go within the federal government and whether or not that's the mechanism or not. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=174.0s)]
*  The point is there needs to be significant cost cutting, significant beyond just identifying the absurdities. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=184.0s)]
*  Can we scale this thing down to efficiency? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=191.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think absolutely. Look, you know, my boss, former boss Tom Coburn was on the Simpson Bulls Debt Commission and he was able to get rid of earmarks and actually help bring about the only spending cut in American history since the end of the Korean War. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=194.0s)]
*  And he didn't have Elon Musk on the side. He didn't have the vague on the side or even a president that was supporting with what we were doing 10 or 15 years ago. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=208.0s)]
*  Right. So when you have the American people at your back and you have Elon Musk, you know, turning the bully pulpit up to 11, they can go much farther than than we ever thought we could go 10 or 15 years ago. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=215.0s)]
*  And look, I think you have to think of this. This is not a demolition project. This is a restoration and renovation project. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=227.0s)]
*  You know, imagine buying an old home that's been poorly updated, has bad insulation and it was owned by a hoarder that had all the stuff that people can relate to that project of let's renovate it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=234.0s)]
*  Let's let's bring back the original splendor of what this American idea is. And that's what Doge is all about. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=245.0s)]
*  Well, Musk's role in this, I suspect, has to be bigger than simply making recommendations to Congress. It's going to have to find some accountability or enforcement mechanism for members of Congress who don't choose to walk down the path of efficiency. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=251.0s)]
*  So we'll keep up with what he does on an ongoing basis. We appreciate you being with us this morning, John Hart. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=264.0s)]
*  You bet. Thank you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHalGZWl18M&t=268.0s)]
