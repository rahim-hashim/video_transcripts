# JD Vance hits back at critics of 'Liberation Day' tariffs: 'Something has finally shifted'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE)
*  We're being told that JD Vance is in position. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=0.0s)]
*  He's ready to be interviewed by our Lawrence Jones. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=3.04s)]
*  Lawrence? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=5.44s)]
*  Hey, Lawrence. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=6.44s)]
*  All right, thanks, family. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=7.44s)]
*  Let's bring in the vice president. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=8.44s)]
*  And Vice President JD Vance, thanks so much for joining Fox and Friends this morning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=9.44s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=12.88s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=13.88s)]
*  So the last time we had a one-on-one was in your house. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=14.88s)]
*  You weren't vice president. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=16.76s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=17.76s)]
*  Yeah, you were auditioning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=18.76s)]
*  You were the only candidate that said if you didn't get selected, you would be disappointed. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=19.76s)]
*  Well, you got accepted. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=25.28s)]
*  So congratulations, Mr. Vice President. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  Let's talk about some of the issues that matter to the American people. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=29.4s)]
*  The president's new tariff policy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=33.04s)]
*  And when I think about what he got elected on is bring the cost down for people, but [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=34.4s)]
*  also bring manufacturing back to the country. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  These are going to kind of hit each other, right? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Explain to us how you get manufacturing here, but also get the cost down for the American [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  people. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, if you go back a little bit, Lawrence, remember during the first Trump administration, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  everybody said that Trump's tariffs were going to be inflationary back then. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=58.04s)]
*  What actually happened? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=61.279999999999994s)]
*  We had 1.5 percent inflation. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=62.28s)]
*  We had the fastest growing economy in a generation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=64.28s)]
*  And we had the beginning of a manufacturing renaissance in the United States of America. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=66.84s)]
*  Then of course, we had four terrible years of the Biden administration. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=71.0s)]
*  But I think it's useful for all of us to step back and ask ourselves, what has the globalist [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=73.58s)]
*  economy gotten the United States of America? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=78.97999999999999s)]
*  And the answer is fundamentally, it's based on two principles, incurring a huge amount [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=81.96s)]
*  of debt to buy things that other countries make for us. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=86.76s)]
*  And to make it a little bit more crystal clear, we borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=90.04s)]
*  the things those Chinese peasants manufacture. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  That is not a recipe for economic prosperity. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=97.62s)]
*  It's not a recipe for low prices. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=100.48s)]
*  And it's not a recipe for good jobs in the United States of America. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=102.2s)]
*  For 40 years, we have gone down that pathway. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=105.28s)]
*  We've seen closing factories. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=108.0s)]
*  We've seen rising inflation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=109.4s)]
*  We've seen the cost of housing so high that most Americans can't afford to buy a home [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=110.92s)]
*  right now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Trump is taking this economy in a different direction. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=116.04s)]
*  He ran on that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  He promised it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  And now he's delivering. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  And yes, this is a big change. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to shy away from it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=123.2s)]
*  But we needed a big change, Lawrence. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  We cannot keep going down the Joe Biden globalist pathway where we have $2 trillion of peacetime [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=126.56s)]
*  debt and deficits. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  We have manufacturing disappearing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=134.6s)]
*  That is not working for Americans. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=136.8s)]
*  We've got to take this country in a different direction. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=138.72s)]
*  Mr. Vice President, there does seem to be a disconnect. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=141.16s)]
*  You see Wall Street in the media and the markets, and they're freaking out right now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=143.84s)]
*  But then I look at those workers that were in the Rose Garden yesterday, and they're [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  celebrating. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  I think about all the diners that I've done across the country, and all these businesses [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  saying we've lost manufacturing here, and they're celebrating the move. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  What is the disconnect between the market and the people, those workers, that are cheering [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=159.72s)]
*  this on right now? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=164.72000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think on one hand, frankly, a lot of people have gotten rich from American jobs [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=165.72000000000003s)]
*  moving overseas, but American workers have not gotten rich. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=169.52s)]
*  And frankly, American companies have not gotten wealthy from the increasing growth of foreign [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=172.28s)]
*  competitors manufacturing overseas. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=178.28s)]
*  As the president says, Lawrence, these foreign companies, they charge us ridiculous tariffs. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=182.44s)]
*  They engage in a lot of non-tariff practices like currency manipulation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=186.96s)]
*  That has been awful for Main Street in the United States of America. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  It's meant those diners, their customers, don't have jobs anymore. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=194.32000000000002s)]
*  It meant those great steel mills, those great auto plants have closed down, and their workers [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  have been laid off. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=201.8s)]
*  What I saw yesterday in the Rose Garden was incredible enthusiasm, because a lot of those [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=202.96s)]
*  workers, they've been working hard for 10, 20, 30, 40 years, young and old, were in the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  Rose Garden yesterday. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=212.24s)]
*  They've never had a president who stood up for their jobs and stood up for American prosperity. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=213.8s)]
*  They finally see something has shifted. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  There were Democrats out there, Republicans. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  There were union and non-union workers alike. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=222.52s)]
*  They know this is a big change, but we need a big change in this country, because what [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=225.08s)]
*  we've done, what we did under the Biden administration, it just wasn't working. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=229.36s)]
*  So Mr. Vice President, I know a lot of MAGA folks, a lot of Americans that are cheering [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  the president on, especially when he takes it to other countries. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=237.36s)]
*  They feel like we've been screwed for a long time. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=239.72000000000003s)]
*  But I also know people that come from our background, they're living paycheck to paycheck. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  And they want to do the patriotic duty of taking it to these other countries, but it's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=246.32000000000002s)]
*  going to hit them a little bit. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=250.84s)]
*  They feel. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=252.16000000000003s)]
*  What can you tell the American people that they just can't afford an extra $3 here and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  there? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=258.0s)]
*  About the government making up the difference from them. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=259.56s)]
*  Will costs go up at some point? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=262.36s)]
*  Will this just be temporary? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=264.32s)]
*  Are we talking three months or six months? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=265.32s)]
*  Well, we certainly hear, and I appreciate, you know how I grew up. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=270.8s)]
*  I grew up in a family that often did live paycheck to paycheck. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=271.8s)]
*  We know a lot of Americans are worried. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=274.36s)]
*  So we are fighting very hard to bring prices down. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=275.76s)]
*  We're going to have the biggest deregulation in the history of this country. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=278.04s)]
*  We're doing a lot of things and already have done a lot of things to lower the cost of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=281.6s)]
*  energy. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=284.72s)]
*  You heard the president mention this yesterday. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=285.72s)]
*  Eggs when we came in were at a 10 year high and all of a sudden they've dropped 60% just [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=287.0s)]
*  in the two months of the Trump administration. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=293.08s)]
*  What I'd ask folks to appreciate here is that we are not going to fix things overnight. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=295.48s)]
*  Joe Biden left us. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=300.32s)]
*  This is not an exaggeration, Lawrence, with the largest peacetime debt and deficit in [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=301.6s)]
*  the history of the United States of America with sky high interest rates. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=306.12s)]
*  You don't fix that stuff overnight. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=309.96s)]
*  We know people are struggling. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=311.72s)]
*  We're fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us, but it's not going to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=314.2s)]
*  happen immediately. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=318.2s)]
*  But we really do believe that if we pursue the right deregulation, we pursue those energy [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=319.2s)]
*  cost reducing policies. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=323.92s)]
*  Yes, people are going to see it in their pocketbook. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  They're also going to benefit from the fact that foreign countries can't take advantage [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=328.36s)]
*  of us anymore. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  That means their jobs are going to be more secure. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=333.24s)]
*  I don't think you can talk about this, the tariffs and not talk about the tax cuts as [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=334.96s)]
*  well that we're expecting. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=339.36s)]
*  Is this to offset some of the cuts that we plan on expecting? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=341.32s)]
*  Will this be a permanent measure or are we thinking when it comes to the scoring of this [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=346.04s)]
*  bill we're going to be able to get cuts as a result of this? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=350.44s)]
*  I wouldn't think of tax cuts as a way to offset the tariffs. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=354.68s)]
*  Here's the way that I think about it is, again, for 40 years we've had an economy that rewards [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=358.24s)]
*  people who ship American jobs overseas and raises taxes on American workers and we're [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=362.84s)]
*  flipping that on its head. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=367.88s)]
*  We're going to cut taxes for American workers and for American companies that build here. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=369.28s)]
*  We're going to make it harder to ship American jobs overseas. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=373.65999999999997s)]
*  It's a total shift in the way that we've done economic policy in the United States of America [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=377.47999999999996s)]
*  but it was necessary. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  So, yeah, we're going to cut your taxes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  You're going to have more money in your pocket and that's of course going to help you deal [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=385.52s)]
*  with the cost of inflation but that's not about offsetting the tariffs. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=388.52s)]
*  They work together. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=392.29999999999995s)]
*  We want to penalize people for shipping our jobs overseas. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  We want to reward hardworking Americans. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=396.67999999999995s)]
*  It's all part of the same policy. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=398.56s)]
*  I want to get to some other news because there were some reports that came out that Elon [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  Musk is leaving. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=403.64s)]
*  Now, of course the president had already said he was only going to be here for a temporary [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=404.64s)]
*  basis. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  Doge will continue after Elon Musk. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  Will he still be an advisor to you and the president? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=412.52s)]
*  I know you all have a great relationship. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=415.28s)]
*  Tell us about it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=416.88s)]
*  Well, first of all, that report I saw was total fake news. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=417.88s)]
*  Elon came in and we said we need you to make government more efficient. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  We need you to shrink the incredible vast bureaucracy that thwarts the will of the American [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=423.7s)]
*  people but also costs way too much money. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=428.96s)]
*  And we said that's going to take about six months and that's what Elon signed up for. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=431.34s)]
*  But of course he's going to continue to be an advisor. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=435.02s)]
*  And by the way, the work of Doge is not even close to done. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=437.71999999999997s)]
*  The work of Elon is not even close to done. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=440.82s)]
*  You look at all of the fraudulent grants that they found. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=443.15999999999997s)]
*  You look at people who are 150 years old who are fraudulently collecting Social Security [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=445.9s)]
*  payments. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=451.96s)]
*  Our Social Security system, 40% of the people who are calling in are actually committing [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=453.12s)]
*  fraud. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=458.29999999999995s)]
*  That means the 60% who need their Social Security checks are waiting in line. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=459.34s)]
*  Doge has got a lot of work to do. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=463.78s)]
*  And yeah, that work's going to continue after Elon leaves. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=465.58s)]
*  But fundamentally, Elon is going to remain a friend and an advisor of both me and the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=468.9s)]
*  president and he's done a lot of good things. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=473.32s)]
*  People don't realize how vast and uncontrolled the bureaucracy was. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=476.34s)]
*  We've started to chip away at it, but there's a lot of work to do. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=480.9s)]
*  It's not going to happen all in six months. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=483.79999999999995s)]
*  It's going to take a long and committed effort. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=485.2s)]
*  Tell us about the news when it comes to TikTok. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=487.0s)]
*  It looks like the president is going to announce maybe today some proposal. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=489.79999999999995s)]
*  Maybe America owns 50% of TikTok. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=494.4s)]
*  A private investor will own the other part. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=496.28s)]
*  Is that going to happen today? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=501.82s)]
*  So I don't want to get ahead of any presidential announcements here. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=503.2s)]
*  But what I've said is we've been working very hard, me and the president, the entire [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=505.65999999999997s)]
*  to really accomplish two things. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=510.22s)]
*  First of all, you want to make sure that the TikTok app in the United States is not spying [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=511.90000000000003s)]
*  on people. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=515.9200000000001s)]
*  It's good for national security. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=516.9200000000001s)]
*  You also want to give people access to this incredible platform, which as we know, that's [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=518.52s)]
*  where a lot of young people get their news. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=522.7s)]
*  That's where a lot of young people found out about the policies of the Trump administration. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=524.7s)]
*  And we've got to accomplish both of those things. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=528.72s)]
*  I think that we're in a good place. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=530.64s)]
*  We're going to keep on working at it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=531.88s)]
*  But I'll let the president make that announcement. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=533.28s)]
*  If it doesn't come out before the deadline, because I know the president extended. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=534.86s)]
*  It'll come out before the deadline. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=538.92s)]
*  It will come out before the deadline. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=539.92s)]
*  We've got to wait a couple of days to continue working on it to finalize some things. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=540.92s)]
*  And of course, we're going to let the president announce whatever we ultimately decide. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=543.6999999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about some of the lawfare in this country, because I think it's important. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=546.68s)]
*  Of course. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=549.4799999999999s)]
*  We're seeing judges block illegal immigrants that came into the country illegally. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=550.4799999999999s)]
*  That was the first crime. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=555.2199999999999s)]
*  And then the second crime, they victimized American citizens. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=556.2199999999999s)]
*  Murder, rapists and all that. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=558.5999999999999s)]
*  What's going to be done about this? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=560.7199999999999s)]
*  We're seeing these one-off stories of, you know, this person was a great father, and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=562.16s)]
*  then they're hanging around with MS-13. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=566.74s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=568.82s)]
*  What's going to be done? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=570.4000000000001s)]
*  The courts are blocking this right now, the executive branch. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=571.4000000000001s)]
*  What are you guys going to do about it? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=574.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, look, we're going to keep on appealing. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=575.1600000000001s)]
*  We're going to keep on fighting back here. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=576.6s)]
*  First of all, we have to remember the most important thing was to stop the bleeding, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=578.44s)]
*  to stop the influx of massive illegal immigration into the country. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=582.24s)]
*  And in two months, the president has already done that. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=586.1600000000001s)]
*  You have illegal border crossings down over 95% in pretty much every part of the American [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=588.08s)]
*  southern border. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=593.1600000000001s)]
*  Then, yeah, we've got to get the violent criminals out of here. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=594.1600000000001s)]
*  We've got to get illegal immigrants who came in during the Biden administration out of [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=596.6s)]
*  our country. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=600.3000000000001s)]
*  That's what we're working on now. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=601.46s)]
*  You're right. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=602.62s)]
*  The courts, some radical left judges have stepped in and said, you're not allowed to deport [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=603.62s)]
*  MS-13 gang members. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=607.78s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=610.0600000000001s)]
*  We think the Supreme Court's going to overrule it, and we're going to keep on fighting for [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=611.0600000000001s)]
*  the president's prerogative to enforce the law. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=613.9s)]
*  Look, you remember, the number of people who came in here, the innocent American, you know, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=616.5400000000001s)]
*  Jocelyn Nungrey who lost their lives, Democrats never wept for them. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=622.38s)]
*  Democrats never issued a congressional resolution of condemnation for their murder. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=627.08s)]
*  Democrats didn't do anything to make it harder for violent thugs to come into our country [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=631.24s)]
*  and prey on innocent young women. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=636.24s)]
*  What they're getting fired up about, what they're most angry about is not that Jocelyn [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=638.68s)]
*  Nungrey was murdered, but that the person who murdered her is getting shipped back home [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=642.88s)]
*  where they belong, not in the United States of America. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=647.08s)]
*  I think it shows a disgraceful set of priorities from congressional Democrats. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=649.8199999999999s)]
*  We're not going to let that stand in our way. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=653.8199999999999s)]
*  We're going to keep on doing the American people's work. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=655.26s)]
*  Mr. Vice President, can I get you to put your lawyer hat on for a second? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=657.14s)]
*  Because they're pointing to one of these cases of a gentleman that they said should not have [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=659.9s)]
*  been deported from El Salvador. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=664.5s)]
*  They said he was not connected to MS-13. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=666.0999999999999s)]
*  What would you tell them about that case? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=669.06s)]
*  Because they're saying that this is a person that was a great member of society. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=671.9399999999999s)]
*  You've looked at the court records. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=677.5s)]
*  You've talked to the men and women on the ground. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=678.92s)]
*  What can you tell us about that situation? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=681.36s)]
*  There have been a few cases out there where the Democrats and the media say, oh, this [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=683.44s)]
*  person was just an innocent father of three. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=687.6s)]
*  Then you find out, for example, I think this is the case that you're talking about. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=689.68s)]
*  Back in 2019, an immigration judge looked at all the evidence, looked at all the data, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=693.2s)]
*  and concluded that this allegedly innocent person that we sent to El Salvador was actually [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=697.88s)]
*  a member of an MS-13 gang. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=702.94s)]
*  He had also committed some traffic violations. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=705.04s)]
*  He had not shown up for some court dates. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=707.5s)]
*  This is not exactly father of the year here. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=709.4200000000001s)]
*  This is a person that we don't think should be in our country. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=712.14s)]
*  Here's the most important point, though, Lawrence, is whatever the argument is, whatever [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=714.82s)]
*  the justification is, no one doubts. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=717.94s)]
*  Not even the crazy left-wing media criticized the idea that we could deport this person. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=720.86s)]
*  They just took issue with the reasoning for why we deported this person. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=726.44s)]
*  This was unquestionably an illegal alien. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=730.44s)]
*  This was unquestionably a person who broke the laws to get into our country. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  This is unquestionably a person an immigration judge had found had zero right to be in the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=736.44s)]
*  United States of America. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=741.5s)]
*  We do not ask permission from far-left Democrats before we deport illegal immigrants. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=743.1s)]
*  We do the American people's business. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=748.36s)]
*  And again, for the American people who are watching, this is such a weird, mistaken placement [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=750.0600000000001s)]
*  of priorities. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=755.58s)]
*  We need to make our country stronger. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=756.58s)]
*  We need to create jobs. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=758.44s)]
*  We need to make our streets safer. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=759.86s)]
*  What is it about Congressional Democrats that get more angry at deporting violent gang [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=761.88s)]
*  members than they do at the victims of those violent gang members? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=766.88s)]
*  I don't even understand where they're coming from. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=770.58s)]
*  They've gone off the deep end, and they've got to come back to reality. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=773.08s)]
*  I think it goes to the larger point, though, about the lawfare happening right now. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=775.88s)]
*  It's not just the immigration cases, but pretty much everything that the executive is doing [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=779.76s)]
*  right now has been challenged in these lower courts. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=783.5s)]
*  Is there a way to expedite this straight to the Supreme Court, or do we legally have [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=787.6s)]
*  to let lower courts make these decisions? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=793.5s)]
*  It goes to the appeal courts, and finally it goes to the Supreme Court. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=797.36s)]
*  People are saying the four years will be up by then. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=800.5s)]
*  Well, there are a lot of things that we can do, not just appeals. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=802.64s)]
*  We can limit the jurisdiction of certain courts. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=806.9s)]
*  Even when certain courts make a ruling, say that you're not allowed to deport a person [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=809.64s)]
*  for a certain reason, we can still deport that person for another reason. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=813.22s)]
*  So it's not like deportations have stopped, but yes, the radical courts are a problem. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=817.5600000000001s)]
*  But our view here is we knew we were going to have this fight. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=822.3000000000001s)]
*  We were prepared for it. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=825.5s)]
*  We're going to litigate it all the way to the Supreme Court. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=826.5s)]
*  We think that we're going to win, and when we do win, that will end this question permanently. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=828.48s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=833.14s)]
*  The Democrats, they're spending so many resources fighting the deportation of gang members. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=834.14s)]
*  You have to ask where are their priorities, but we knew they were going to do this. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=839.64s)]
*  We're prepared for it, Lawrence, and we're going to fight all the way to the top of the [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=843.56s)]
*  courts. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=846.1999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Vice President, I think about your life story. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=847.1999999999999s)]
*  Very similar to mine as well, growing up with nothing, and now you're the Vice President [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=850.6s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=853.84s)]
*  It's a great country, man. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=854.84s)]
*  It is a great country. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=855.84s)]
*  We're almost at the 100-day mark. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=856.84s)]
*  We know the President has been strong on the border. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=858.68s)]
*  We've seen almost operational control of the border at this point. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=860.4s)]
*  We've seen the waste, fraud, and abuse being brought to light. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=864.12s)]
*  How do you think? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=868.56s)]
*  How would you rate this first 100 days? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=870.4799999999999s)]
*  I think the President has done more in 100 days than almost any administration has done [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=872.76s)]
*  in eight years. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=876.8s)]
*  I really think that when you consider the southern border, which was the biggest crisis [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=877.8s)]
*  that we got elected to solve, two months in, border crossings are almost at zero when it [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=882.28s)]
*  comes to illegal border crossings. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=887.8s)]
*  When I think just about where I grew up, the factory closures, the fact that friends of [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=890.2399999999999s)]
*  mine were getting their parents laid off. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=894.4399999999999s)]
*  I talk to a lot of people who couldn't afford a home on the campaign trail. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=896.6s)]
*  I talk to women who are worried about the price of a dozen eggs. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=899.72s)]
*  We're making steady progress on all those issues. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=903.0s)]
*  Yes, it doesn't happen overnight, but when you look at the hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=905.8s)]
*  in new investment coming into our country, auto plants that were planned to close that [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=909.76s)]
*  are now adding shifts as opposed to closing, egg prices that are way down, gasoline prices [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=914.4s)]
*  that are way down, we're making a lot of progress, but there's still a lot left to do. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=920.16s)]
*  I know the president is laser focused on it, so am I. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=925.04s)]
*  You have become almost the fighter in chief. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=927.48s)]
*  The president sends out a message and he puts it in bullet points for the American people. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=931.16s)]
*  Then you go on the Sunday shows and you duke it out with them. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=935.68s)]
*  Sometimes you have duke, you duke it out with world leaders in the Oval Office as well. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=938.4s)]
*  There's a lot of people saying about the mantle of MAGA, what happens after these four years. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=943.12s)]
*  I guess this is my final question to you. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=947.5999999999999s)]
*  Do you run for president after this? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=950.9599999999999s)]
*  I know you're going to tell me you're going to focus on being vice president right now, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=953.76s)]
*  but people are wondering if we can accomplish all of this in four years and they want some [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=958.36s)]
*  security in that. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=962.64s)]
*  Is JD the man to continue the MAGA agenda? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=964.64s)]
*  Well, look, man, I really am just not focused on politics. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=969.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm not focused on the midterm elections in 2026, much less the presidential election [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=972.76s)]
*  in 2028. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=977.24s)]
*  When we get to that point, I'll talk to the president. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=978.24s)]
*  We'll figure out what we want to do. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=980.44s)]
*  The way that I think about it is if we do a good job, the politics take care of themselves. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=982.08s)]
*  I just want America to be wealthy again. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=987.2s)]
*  I want our communities to be safe again. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=989.36s)]
*  I want us to be opening factories rather than closing down factories. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=991.8000000000001s)]
*  I want people of my generation to be able to afford a home to raise a family in. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=995.48s)]
*  I want to stop all the ridiculous wars that were started by the previous administrations. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1000.2s)]
*  There's so much to do, man, and I don't really think that much about what happens in three [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1004.96s)]
*  and a half years. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1008.9200000000001s)]
*  If I do a good job, if the president does a good job for the American people, and I [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1009.92s)]
*  know that we will, the politics will take care of itself, let's just do a good job. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1014.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, when you do decide, you've got to make me a promise. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1018.4799999999999s)]
*  It's going to be on Fox and Friends. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1021.0s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1022.4799999999999s)]
*  We'll talk, man. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1023.4799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1024.48s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1025.48s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1026.48s)]
*  All right, family, just wrapped up with the vice president of the United States, JD Vance. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1027.48s)]
*  I'll send it to you guys. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1029.8799999999999s)]
*  Very nice. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1030.8799999999999s)]
*  Good job, Lawrence. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1031.8799999999999s)]
*  Great. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1032.8799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAnFYFalFrE&t=1033.8799999999999s)]
