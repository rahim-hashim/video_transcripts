# The irony here is crushing: Turley
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI)
*  Department of Justice making a move on Maine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's bring in back Jonathan Turley. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=3.0s)]
*  Jonathan, your thoughts now that you saw the case. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=5.0s)]
*  Well, I think that Maine has a serious problem on their hands. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=10.0s)]
*  You know, there is no entitlement to federal funds. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=13.0s)]
*  Now, the Supreme Court says that the government cannot commandeer states. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=16.0s)]
*  So the government can, in a heavy-handed way, violate the Constitution. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=20.0s)]
*  But it was in Rumsfeld v. Fair, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=26.0s)]
*  that the Supreme Court voted unanimously to say that federal funds could be withheld from states for the failure to comply with federal law. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=28.0s)]
*  Now, in that case, there was a thing called the Solomon Amendment. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=37.0s)]
*  In this case, they're arguing, look, this is Title IX. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=40.0s)]
*  And in 1972, certainly, the drafters had no intention of extending the definition of gender this far. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=43.0s)]
*  The irony is that just this week, the British High Court ruled on their Equality Act [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=51.0s)]
*  that transgender individuals do not meet the definition of a woman or the definition of sex. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=58.0s)]
*  And so that ruling just came down within the last 24 hours from one of our allies. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=65.0s)]
*  So this is an issue that other countries are grappling with as well. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=70.0s)]
*  But Jonathan, do you think this is going to force, to that point, the Supreme Court to rule? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=74.0s)]
*  What is a man and what is a woman? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=80.0s)]
*  Because there's no way this can be enforced unless we finally get that definition, right? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=82.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=88.0s)]
*  And I think this is heading their way, like so many other things. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=90.0s)]
*  This is going to force them, in all likelihood, to deal with this conclusively. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=94.0s)]
*  They've had opinions on both sides. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=101.0s)]
*  It's not clear where the majority stands in past cases. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=103.0s)]
*  This will force the issue. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=108.0s)]
*  And I expect that the Trump administration has an advantage, at least on some of this, on a major part of this funding. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=110.0s)]
*  Right, yep. They do have an idea what a man and woman is. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=117.0s)]
*  That's more than a lot of other people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=120.0s)]
*  Jonathan, if you look at the cover of the New York Post, it says, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=122.0s)]
*  It's about Letitia James, who remember took... [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=125.0s)]
*  The Attorney General. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=129.0s)]
*  The Attorney General who put President Trump on trial and it cost him $454 million. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=130.0s)]
*  That was the judgment. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=139.0s)]
*  Well, now she is being hit with a federal criminal referral for alleged mortgage fraud. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=140.0s)]
*  Apparently she has this house in Virginia. Is that the state, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=146.0s)]
*  And she put her dad as her husband. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=149.0s)]
*  She's being accused of that on the form. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=153.0s)]
*  What were some other things that were... [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=156.0s)]
*  Her main resident as Virginia. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=157.0s)]
*  That's right. She put her main resident... [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=159.0s)]
*  There were a bunch of mistakes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=160.0s)]
*  So is that illegal? What happens here? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=161.0s)]
*  It is illegal. There are people who are prosecuted for listing residences as their principal residence in order to secure loans. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=165.0s)]
*  There was just such a case last week. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=174.0s)]
*  In Baltimore, the District Attorney was convicted of a similar case. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=177.0s)]
*  There are plenty of these fraud cases that are brought by the Department of Justice. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=181.0s)]
*  Now, obviously, the irony here is crushing, but this is a New York Attorney General who said that these are not just technicalities, that they will enforce adherence to these types of rules. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=186.0s)]
*  She also said that Trump, in his case, could not claim that third parties filled out these forms. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=202.0s)]
*  She said you are ultimately responsible for documents filed under your name. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=208.0s)]
*  Sure. So, Jonathan, when you take out an application on a mortgage, which becomes public record if it's a mortgage through public facilities, and you write down your job title is Attorney General, State of New York. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=213.0s)]
*  Yeah, my primary resident is in the Commonwealth of Virginia. You would think that that would be a head-scratcher. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=228.0s)]
*  But to your point about third parties filling out forms, do you think she's going to come back and say, look, I had somebody do that, they made some mistakes, my bad? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=234.0s)]
*  Yeah, that dog won't hunt because James shot that dog. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=245.0s)]
*  I mean, the fact is that when Trump was up, that was one of the arguments that she said she found no credence at all. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=249.0s)]
*  I mean, this is like Donald Trump saying that a house in Pennsylvania is his principal residence as opposed to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=258.0s)]
*  There's a serious problem with that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=267.0s)]
*  Now, one of the things that is raised in this referral is that each of these errors or false statements work to the advantage of getting better terms on the loans. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=269.0s)]
*  Now, there's another irony here. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=280.0s)]
*  You know, James used a New York statute against Trump that didn't even require there to be a victim, that no one lost a dime in the Trump case. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=282.0s)]
*  And James said it didn't matter. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=290.0s)]
*  She wanted more than the half a billion dollars in that fine, even though the banks wanted more business with Trump. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=292.0s)]
*  In this case, they will be able to argue that these were false statements that worked to her advantage. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=300.0s)]
*  Now, the Supreme Court just ruled on one of these statutes called it's a Section 1014, but it narrowed the definition. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=307.0s)]
*  But this would still meet that definition. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=314.0s)]
*  These are direct false statements. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=316.0s)]
*  Wow. So in 83 in 2000, she had her dad as co-signer and listed him as her spouse. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=318.0s)]
*  Sounds like she's in trouble. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=325.0s)]
*  That doesn't sound right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=326.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=327.0s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you very much. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=328.0s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kW-BniKDzI&t=329.0s)]
