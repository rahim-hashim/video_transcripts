# Peter Doocy confronts KJP on rhetoric calling Trump a 'threat'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM)
*  Yesterday Donald Trump rallying voters in swing state of Michigan his first [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=0.0s)]
*  public appearance since that second attempt on his life on Sunday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=4.88s)]
*  President it's a little bit dangerous it's you know they think race car [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=9.44s)]
*  driving is dangerous no they think you're bull riding that's pretty scary [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=14.4s)]
*  right no this is a dangerous business so we have to keep it safe then you wonder [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=18.8s)]
*  why I get shot at right you know only consequential presidents get shot at. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=23.94s)]
*  Well this all comes as Congress is hoping to vote this week on a bipartisan [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=31.220000000000002s)]
*  bill to give former President Trump a higher level of security. The speaker of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=36.660000000000004s)]
*  the House Mike Johnson joins us right now from DC with an update. Mr. Speaker [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=41.38s)]
*  good morning. Hey Steve great to be with you. It's good to have you as well. We all [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=44.82s)]
*  know and painfully so over the last couple of months former presidents don't [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=49.14s)]
*  get the same kind of Secret Service protection current presidents do. Given [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=54.5s)]
*  the threat level and given the fact that he is the nominee and could be [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=59.900000000000006s)]
*  president United States again in you know re-elected in less than 50 days he [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=64.06s)]
*  needs more people. Yes he does and I had that conversation with the White House [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=70.42s)]
*  yesterday I called and demanded that President Trump receive the same level [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=76.34s)]
*  of protection that the sitting president does because he is under such great [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=80.22s)]
*  threat. I mean clearly he's the most threatened figure in American public [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=85.02000000000001s)]
*  life and the Secret Service has an obligation to protect him so they need [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=88.94s)]
*  to make every available asset assigned to him right now and President Trump [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=93.06s)]
*  and I have talked about this and now I've talked about it with the the White [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=97.9s)]
*  House now they say they're going to be cooperative but they also say there's a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=101.02000000000001s)]
*  manpower issue so Congress is looking at every aspect of this if we need to add [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=104.14s)]
*  additional funding we will but it's in difficult to go higher 2,500 new Secret [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=108.14s)]
*  Service agents in the next 48 days right so they're gonna have to rely upon in [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=113.26s)]
*  some cases to fill the gaps local and state law enforcement and so we're [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=117.06s)]
*  looking at every aspect this job must be done President Trump must be protected. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=120.7s)]
*  Absolutely and you mentioned the word threat either two or three times in in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=125.26s)]
*  your answer right there he faces a lot of threats and a lot of it is actually [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=130.33999999999997s)]
*  you know the rhetoric in American politics right now on both sides is hot [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  it's hot but in particular the the White House this White House the president the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=141.29999999999998s)]
*  vice president and even the press secretary have referred to Donald Trump [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=147.7s)]
*  as a threat a threat to democracy our White House correspondent who I think [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=152.17999999999998s)]
*  does a great job called them on this yesterday watch this how many more [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=157.34s)]
*  assassination attempts on Donald Trump until the president and the vice [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=162.86s)]
*  president and you pick a different word to describe Trump other than threat. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=166.7s)]
*  Peter if anything from this administration I actually completely [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=173.38s)]
*  disagree with the premise of your question the question that you're asking [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=181.1s)]
*  it is also incredibly dangerous in the way that you're asking it because [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=184.94s)]
*  American people are watching. Mr. Speaker how do you react to that? It's absurd [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=190.74s)]
*  KJP is absurd and as usual Mr. Ducey asked the right questions Peter's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=198.02s)]
*  exactly on point the Democrats rhetoric has been so over the top they have for [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=203.26s)]
*  years now tried to convince people that Donald Trump is equivalent to Hitler [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=208.26s)]
*  that he's you know some great threat to the our democracy you've hear him say it [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=212.73999999999998s)]
*  over and over that triggers people that triggers people like the two shooters [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  that have already tried to make an attempt on his life this everybody has [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=221.66s)]
*  a responsibility certainly those at the top of the Democratic Party to turn the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=225.61999999999998s)]
*  heat down let's have a vigorous debate on policy fantastic let's have a debate [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=229.54s)]
*  about the record of both of these officials but don't try to convince [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=234.85999999999999s)]
*  people that he's some sort of threat Donald Trump is running for president to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=238.89999999999998s)]
*  save the country his policies his ideas are going to save America and it's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=242.3s)]
*  absurd for them to continue in this charade and it's it's actually really [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=246.54000000000002s)]
*  quite dangerous. Mr. Speaker let's get to your day job today there's gonna be a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=249.74s)]
*  vote on a short-term funding bill it you know it's not gonna pass what's gonna [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=254.86s)]
*  happen? Listen Congress has an immediate obligation to do two very important [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=261.98s)]
*  things we have to keep the government funded and we need to make sure that our [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=267.1s)]
*  elections are secure and we have a vehicle today to do both things because [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=271.02s)]
*  we owe that to the American people and because they demand it we're moving [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=274.7s)]
*  legislation today to have a continued resolution to keep the government going [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=278.18s)]
*  for six months and to make sure that illegals cannot vote non-citizens [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=281.9s)]
*  cannot vote in the upcoming election it's a number one issue around the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=286.18s)]
*  country Steve I've been traveling non-stop for campaign events around the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=289.26s)]
*  country 206 cities and 40 states so far okay everywhere I go the first or second [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=292.7s)]
*  question in every public forum is can we count on the security of the vote and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=298.5s)]
*  we've got to make sure that happens right now millions and millions of [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=303.02s)]
*  illegals they've come across the border since the borders are Kamala Harris [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=306.78s)]
*  open it wide with Joe Biden and many of them are trying to register to vote we [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=309.98s)]
*  know that is a fact we've already had audits in a number of states and we have [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=314.46s)]
*  to ensure that identification and proof of citizenship is offered when someone [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=318.94s)]
*  registers to vote plain and simple the Democrats don't want that and we're [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=324.66s)]
*  gonna try to push it through today okay I noticed you said gonna try if it [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=328.06s)]
*  doesn't work any suggestions what plan B might be that it would probably have to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=332.82s)]
*  be a clean CR and then you would need Democrats to help you I don't talk [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=338.46s)]
*  about plan B Steve I'm the quarterback on the field we're running the play okay [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=342.5s)]
*  I got to focus on that down the field now there's a big playbook lots of ideas [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=345.74s)]
*  okay but this is the play this is the right one by the way it's almost a 90% [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=349.06s)]
*  issue in the country it's it's not even partisan everybody understands only US [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=353.42s)]
*  citizens should vote in US elections and so we are going to force that not just [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=358.82s)]
*  the message but the legislation this is a real play we're gonna try to get it [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=363.38s)]
*  done today well good luck to you sir thank you very much for starting your [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdXKcGC6NSM&t=366.66s)]
