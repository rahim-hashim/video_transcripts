# Trey Yingst warns latest attack on Israel could lead to 'much larger conflict'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E)
*  So let's kick things off. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=0.0s)]

*  This week, negotiators from Israel, the United States, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=2.64s)]
*  and the country of Qatar meeting over a ceasefire [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=5.48s)]
*  and hostage releases in Gaza, as tensions grow in the Middle [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=8.96s)]
*  East following that horrific attack on Israel [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=12.72s)]
*  over the weekend that killed at least 17 kids. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=15.4s)]
*  All right, Trey Yanks is live in northern Israel [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=18.88s)]
*  all over this story, where those rocket attacks took place [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=21.0s)]
*  over in the Golan Heights. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=24.04s)]
*  Trey. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=25.04s)]
*  Yeah, hey, guys. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=28.04s)]
*  Overnight, the Israeli cabinet met [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=28.6s)]
*  to discuss operational plans for offensive action [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=30.28s)]
*  against the Iran-backed group Hezbollah. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=33.7s)]
*  This does come after a rocket attack in the Golan Heights [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  killed 12 Druze children and teens. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=38.68s)]
*  We were there in the aftermath. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=41.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  The cousin of 11-year-old Alma Fakhir Eldin weeps [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=47.0s)]
*  as she clutches her photo. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  It's all that she has left of the young Druze child, one [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=52.52s)]
*  of 12 people killed in Saturday's Hezbollah rocket [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=55.94s)]
*  attack. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=59.019999999999996s)]
*  At their family home, Alma's father [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=59.98s)]
*  stands in her bright pink room. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=61.98s)]
*  This was her schoolwork. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=64.14s)]
*  This is a course in Germany. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=65.34s)]
*  Eliminate Hezbollah. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=68.62s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=69.84s)]
*  That's what I want. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=70.62s)]
*  I'm in Fakhir Eldin says. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=71.7s)]
*  What do you remember about her most? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=73.86s)]
*  When she was alive or when I had to collect the pieces of her, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=76.02s)]
*  he responds. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=79.02s)]
*  With a population of just 11,000 people, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=80.25999999999999s)]
*  the trauma of this attack affected [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=83.18s)]
*  every resident of Majd al-Shamz, a Druze community [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=84.9s)]
*  in the Golan Heights that held a large funeral today [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=88.34s)]
*  for the dead. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=91.10000000000001s)]
*  The grief that Majd al-Shamz is experiencing collectively [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=92.02000000000001s)]
*  right now is unimaginable. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=95.7s)]
*  There are 12 young members of their community [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=97.9s)]
*  being buried in the aftermath of this horrific Hezbollah [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=101.54s)]
*  rocket attack. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=105.58000000000001s)]
*  At the scene of the attack, teams [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=106.7s)]
*  are still going inch by inch searching [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=108.10000000000001s)]
*  for any remains of those killed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=110.30000000000001s)]
*  Between the shrapnel, bikes, and scooters, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=112.30000000000001s)]
*  a crater marks the site of the massacre. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=114.66s)]
*  The wounded and the dead were children wearing sports gear, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=118.46s)]
*  this first responder says. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=121.74s)]
*  It's a disaster. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=123.42s)]
*  The region is bracing for the possibility of a broader [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=126.89999999999999s)]
*  war with Hezbollah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=129.9s)]
*  Right now, multiple international airlines [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  are suspending flights in and out of Beirut, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=133.9s)]
*  and some countries are calling on their citizens [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=136.66s)]
*  to leave Lebanon immediately. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=139.42s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=141.54s)]
*  Hey, Trey, were they aiming? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=142.26s)]
*  Is it possible they were actually aiming for the Druze [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=143.82s)]
*  community? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  Because isn't that complex? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=146.54s)]
*  Because there were Druze in Lebanon, correct? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=148.26s)]
*  So they're probably angry at Hezbollah in Lebanon, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=150.98s)]
*  where the rockets came from. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=154.06s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=157.38s)]
*  It's a great point. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=158.1s)]
*  And they've fired thousands of rockets into northern Israel [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=158.94s)]
*  and the Golan Heights since October 8, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=161.74s)]
*  just one day after the October 7 massacre. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=164.34s)]
*  It's tough to tell what exactly they were aiming for, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=167.01999999999998s)]
*  but the devastation there is clear. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=169.7s)]
*  And the Israelis, we understand, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=171.7s)]
*  are set to send a message of deterrence to this Iran-backed [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=173.33999999999997s)]
*  group in southern Lebanon in the days ahead. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=176.73999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=179.22s)]
*  And Trey, the size of the message, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=180.06s)]
*  because we had the ambassador on about an hour and a half ago, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=182.38s)]
*  and he said in the next couple of days, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=185.14s)]
*  they're going to fire back. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=186.85999999999999s)]
*  But the administration in this country [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=188.17999999999998s)]
*  has already advised Israel, don't overdo it, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=190.73999999999998s)]
*  because ultimately, Hezbollah, which is run by Iran, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=194.01999999999998s)]
*  might see this as crossing a red line, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=199.9s)]
*  and then you've got a great big war. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=202.06s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  And it's remarkable how little we [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=206.82s)]
*  heard from the Biden administration [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=208.58s)]
*  over the weekend following this rocket attack. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=210.22s)]
*  There were 12 teens and children killed in this gruesome attack, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=212.86s)]
*  the deadliest day for this country [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=216.34s)]
*  and the territory it controls since October 7. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=218.62s)]
*  And we heard very little from Washington in the aftermath, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=222.1s)]
*  understanding that this is a pivotal moment [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=225.06s)]
*  in the broader war and something that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  could lead to a much larger conflict across the Middle East. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=229.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=232.94s)]
*  While they're having peace or ceasefire negotiations [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=233.44s)]
*  with the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=236.78s)]
*  Can I real quick follow up there, Trey? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=237.9s)]
*  I know they had identified 11 of the 12 children, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=239.5s)]
*  and they were still working to identify the 12th. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=242.98s)]
*  Have they been able to so far? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=245.82s)]
*  They were able to identify the 12th. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  And without describing some of the graphic details [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=251.82s)]
*  that we know having been on the scene, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=254.5s)]
*  it took them a lot of time to identify this final child. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=256.62s)]
*  And the families in this community [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=260.3s)]
*  of just 11,000 people near to the border with Lebanon [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=261.97999999999996s)]
*  were mourning throughout the day. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=265.62s)]
*  There were people as we were there on the ground [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=266.85999999999996s)]
*  searching for any remains from this child. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=268.9s)]
*  Today they were able to hold a funeral for him. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=270.97999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=273.82s)]
*  Trey Yngst in the region. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=274.38s)]
*  Trey, thank you very much. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=275.82s)]
*  Thank you, Trey. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=276.9s)]
*  They got about 80,000 people displaced in Israel [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=277.94s)]
*  off the border with Hezbollah because of the rocket fire. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=281.9s)]
*  So they're living in hotels, horrible existence. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=285.54s)]
*  So there's got to be some type of, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRuoS5IAj4E&t=288.18s)]
