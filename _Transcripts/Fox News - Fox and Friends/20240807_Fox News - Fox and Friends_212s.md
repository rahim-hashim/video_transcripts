# Kristi Noem unleashes on Kamala's 'radical' VP pick: 'Took away the freedom of his people'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y)
*  What are you going to do about bringing down the rent and things like that in the economy? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Because out of eight children that I'm a father and a stepfather to, five of them are struggling [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=4.44s)]
*  and I'm giving them part of my income on a regular basis. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=10.36s)]
*  We are going to drill, baby, drill. We're going to bring down the cost of energy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=14.8s)]
*  Energy is what caused the worst inflation, I think, in the history of our country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=18.36s)]
*  Food prices are up 50 percent. Sometimes more. You look at bacon. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=22.76s)]
*  Bacon is quadrupled. You can't order bacon. You can't order anything. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=27.04s)]
*  We're living horribly. We have the worst inflation we've probably ever had in our country. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=31.04s)]
*  And it started because of energy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=35.92s)]
*  OK, so let's head back to South Dakota where Governor Kristi Noem is live with Lawrence. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  Hey, guys. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=43.68s)]
*  Hey, good morning, family. Got the great governor for the great state of South Dakota here with me. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=46.28s)]
*  You just heard that sound bite from that gentleman that's sitting next to your left [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=51.64s)]
*  describing Biden's America. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=54.92s)]
*  Will things get better? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=58.44s)]
*  They will. If President Trump gets back in the White House. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=59.92s)]
*  And that's what I think is so remarkable is how much people are suffering under the policies of Joe Biden. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=61.96s)]
*  President Trump said it exactly correct this morning when he talked about energy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=67.12s)]
*  Everything in our economy is run on energy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=71.28s)]
*  We're transporting groceries. If we're moving people across the country, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=74.12s)]
*  if they're deciding to take a family vacation, if we can drive down energy costs, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=77.36s)]
*  that will impact every single thing that a family needs to take care of their day to day lives. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=81.28s)]
*  So our grocery store costs have gone up in this country. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=86.68s)]
*  People's medical bills are going up. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=90.2s)]
*  It's a long ways to drive to work and to school. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=92.4s)]
*  And it impacts them. And they're making decisions on if they can buy their kids new tennis shoes for school [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  and if they're going to get a new backpack. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  It's a choice now where before when President Trump was in the White House, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=101.44s)]
*  they could go out and provide for their kids and get them ready for this fall coming up. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris has decided who's going to be her vice presidential pick. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  And y'all got elected at the same time. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  You South Dakota, him Minnesota. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=116.44s)]
*  What do we need to know about Walls? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=118.48s)]
*  Well, he's a radical. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  I served with him in Congress for several years, too, and then we both ran as governor at the same time. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  But it was interesting how different decisions impacted the people in our states differently. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=127.08s)]
*  You know, if you remember, he shut down his state. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=131.28s)]
*  He mandated masks and vaccines. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=133.28s)]
*  He attacked me for hosting the Sturgis motorcycle bike rally. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=135.28s)]
*  He said he would have absolutely not held it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=139.32000000000002s)]
*  And he said that this place was spreading covid and was something that America shouldn't give place to. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=141.56s)]
*  This is an outdoor. It is an outdoor event. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=148.36s)]
*  And people what I love about Sturgis is these people here love their freedom and they understand that government shouldn't take it away. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=150.44s)]
*  Governor Walls took away the freedom of his people. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  In fact, thousands of people have moved to South Dakota from Minnesota to get away from his policy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=160.32s)]
*  What about law and order? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=165.24s)]
*  We think about what happened during the summer of love. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=166.6s)]
*  The riots started under his watch in Minnesota and he called the surrounding governors and asked for help because he waited too long. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=168.84s)]
*  He didn't take decisive action. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=175.68s)]
*  He didn't support his cops and he had a mess on his hands. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=177.16s)]
*  And when he panicked, he called us for help to bring law and order back to his streets. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=180.04s)]
*  And that's what I think is remarkable is he's not a decision maker. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=184.6s)]
*  And at the end of the day, when he promised his law enforcement more resources, he didn't follow through. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=187.48s)]
*  Instead, he supported BLM and he supported those that were perpetuating violence on his streets. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=192.04s)]
*  And if you look at Minneapolis today, it is not the same. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=196.88s)]
*  I don't know if it'll ever be the same. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=199.0s)]
*  A lot of those businesses have not come back. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  Governor, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=202.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=204.12s)]
*  All right, guys, it's been great being here at Sturgis and I'll send it back to you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=204.8s)]
*  Very nicely done. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7TrKi9o20Y&t=210.28s)]
