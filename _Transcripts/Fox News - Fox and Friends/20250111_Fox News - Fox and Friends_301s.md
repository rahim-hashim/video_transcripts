*  10% contained [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Malibu's Pepperdine University my alma mater has been closed since Wednesday in response to those fires [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=10.92s)]
*  Pepperdine University president Jim Gash joins us now Jim great to see you this morning, you know, I were just speaking off air [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=17.240000000000002s)]

*  warning zone at Pepperdine [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  But not in a mandatory evacuation and because of a fire a few weeks ago [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=28.84s)]
*  You have a burn scar around the campus which would essentially protect it from the fire coming your way and threatening campus [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  Is that a fair assessment of where you are at Pepperdine? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=38.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's correct. We were scheduled to start classes on Monday this coming Monday. We have moved those classes online, but we are not [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  Immediately affected by the the the fires itself because of that two and a half mile buffer [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=50.72s)]
*  Hedge of protection around us, but that doesn't mean that our community and members of our faculty staff and students [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=56.699999999999996s)]
*  Haven't been directly affected. We have over [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=63.4s)]
*  Several dozen who have lost their homes lost their their ability to be close to campus including my daughter my executive assistant [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  Both have lost their homes as well. No, I'm so sorry to hear that Jim. You've been through this [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=74.0s)]
*  Anyone who's gone to Pepperdine been around Pepperdine Malibu for that matter Southern, California. They're familiar with fires [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=79.32s)]
*  They understand they understand evacuating. I'm curious and I've heard others say this is the worst ever in your experience [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=85.55999999999999s)]
*  Jim having even done this a few weeks ago, right? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  You guys did this in at Pepperdine a few weeks ago. It happened twice in my four years there [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  Will you put this into context? Like how does this compare to what Southern Californians have come to expect with fires? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=100.38s)]
*  Yeah, I had been at Pepperdine for 25 years been present the last five and this is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=106.8s)]
*  Materially different than the prior ones. The other ones were were scary. They were intense [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=112.0s)]
*  This is so widespread so fast moving with such heavy winds that this is an order of magnitude larger [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=117.84s)]
*  Particularly given what is happening in the greater Southern California area with the Eaton fire and the Kenneth fire and the other fires [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=125.28s)]
*  They're all [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=132.88s)]
*  Scary and intense, but this one seems to be a level above the rest [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=135.04s)]
*  How can you everyone talks about palisades? It's spared the brunt of this when it comes to the palisades fire [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=139.6s)]
*  It's really bad out there with the Eaton fire as well [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=145.84s)]
*  And by the way, you have the Kenneth fire just across the canyon from you [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=147.84s)]
*  I lived in Calabasas a lot of students live in Calabasas. So it's around you all around you [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  Just give us a sense of the community. Like what's it like in Malibu right now? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=156.8s)]
*  Yeah, we are coordinating directly with the LA County fire and the Cal fire as they are with us and in fact yesterday [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=161.28s)]
*  representatives from Central Command [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=168.08s)]
*  Took me and the the executive vice president on kind of a driving tour around the affected areas [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=170.56s)]
*  Just to get a better sense of what was happening on the ground and I will tell you this was a [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=176.56s)]
*  Devastating war zone is what it looked like the Malibu community is tired [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  Is is uh [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=187.28s)]
*  Eager for for some relief, but they are strong. They are resilient. They are [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=189.28s)]
*  bonding together taking care of each other, but it is it is one of the most [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=196.16s)]
*  Stressful times that this city has endured it will as you drive from Santa Monica to Malibu [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=202.32s)]
*  It's disorienting because you can see the Pacific Ocean on your left where typically you would just [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=208.64s)]
*  See a row of houses and so many have lost housing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=214.0s)]
*  Palisades looks like like a war zone [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=218.86s)]
*  Just it almost looks like ancient Rome where you drive through and say this is where the things used to be [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  And they're just not there. It's uh, it's really distressing. I can only imagine thousands [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=226.72s)]
*  Make that drive from Santa Monica up to Malibu on on pch and yeah, it's an image [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  It's it's a famous image that everyone's come to understand and to to think about [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=236.96s)]
*  It's just all gone. I do want to say while pepperon is often under threat for fires [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=241.04s)]
*  What people may not know is pepperon is also a very important staging ground for all the firefighters and first responders and it is again [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=248.64s)]
*  Through this fire you guys playing your role there and helping out in southern, California [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=256.24s)]
*  Including including providing a water supply for the helicopters the helicopters come to the two [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=260.4s)]
*  Small lakes on our campus and are just consistently using their snorkels to send up water and drop it [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=267.12s)]
*  And yeah for those who are interested in helping there's a pepperdine strong fund to help those affected [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K2aKJ_Up8&t=273.68s)]
