# Mike Huckabee reacts to meeting hostage families in Israel: â€˜They are suffering'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0)
*  This Christmas morning, we don't forget about the millions celebrating under the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=0.0s)]
*  cloud of war and tragedy. Yeah, and our next guest saw it firsthand while in [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=3.72s)]
*  Israel last week, meeting hostage families and Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=7.4s)]
*  Netanyahu. But here at home, he says it's all about faith and family and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=10.96s)]
*  joining us now with their Christmas message. The Gov Mike Huckabee, along [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=17.06s)]
*  with his beautiful wife Janet. So great to have you all with us. Merry [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=21.56s)]
*  Christmas to you. And don't forget to give Sarah our best as well. I'm liking [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=24.8s)]
*  the beard there, Gov. It's coming in nicer every year now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=30.04s)]
*  Yeah, eventually I could be a department store Santa during this time of year. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  That's what I'm auditioning for. That's beautiful. What is your message? My [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=38.8s)]
*  friend? I know that the reason for the season is something that is near and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=43.16s)]
*  dear to your heart and obviously to Janet's as well. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=47.8s)]
*  Well, we're just so grateful to live in a country like America. We're grateful [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=51.92s)]
*  to have a wonderful church and church family. Uh, yesterday was a delightful [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=56.32s)]
*  day at our church. And then we did something we've been doing for a long [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=61.44s)]
*  time. We go to Christmas Eve service and then we take the family. We all go eat [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=64.88s)]
*  Chinese food on Christmas Eve evening. So we've done that. And then later [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=69.32s)]
*  today we'll go to Sarah's house for watching her kids open the presents. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=74.48s)]
*  Yesterday we had a big family get together with all of the grandkids, all [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=78.96s)]
*  seven of them. So it was lots of noise, food flying and a great reminder of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=82.64s)]
*  God's love for us. And we're just enjoying this beautiful day, especially [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  a respite from what I saw last week when I was in Israel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Governor, tell us a little bit more about that trip to Israel and what [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  you learned and what you saw. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=100.8s)]
*  You know, Carly, it's so much worse than anyone can describe. And the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=102.72s)]
*  incredible, vicious savagery that the people of Israel experienced on October [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  the 7th is simply unspeakable. Things that cannot be discussed even in mixed [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=112.96s)]
*  company are on television for sure. And I think people across the world should [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=118.32s)]
*  follow that biblical mandate and pray for the peace of Jerusalem. But I want [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=123.35999999999999s)]
*  people to understand that it was a true contrast between good and evil. And [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=127.35999999999999s)]
*  what happened was evil. And I know there's extraordinary suffering in Gaza [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=133.04000000000002s)]
*  with people who are there, but they're suffering because of Hamas, not because [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=138.24s)]
*  of Israel. And they could end the suffering if Hamas would quit their [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  terrorism. And I hope they will. It's not likely because it's an evil force. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=146.24s)]
*  But, you know, in the midst of that, we shouldn't forget that on this day we [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=151.68s)]
*  celebrate that God didn't just send a message. He didn't just send a book. He [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=155.68s)]
*  came in person and he delivered his message of love in a human form. And what [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=160.0s)]
*  a great way to remind ourselves of that today. Such a great message, Governor. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=164.88s)]
*  But I want to give Janet a chance to weigh in because, Janet, you know, we [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=169.04s)]
*  know behind every family and yours is among the most successful in the nation [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=173.68s)]
*  with your husband, with your daughter, giving themselves such service. What's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=178.56s)]
*  the secret, Janet? Was it the Christmas traditions? I mean, your family is so [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=184.56s)]
*  special and so dear to the country. Well, I think our faith is the secret. And so [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=189.6s)]
*  many times, especially this time of year, one of my main traditions is to put out [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=197.04s)]
*  the manger scenes. And I have manger scenes from all of the world and keep [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=202.72s)]
*  them out most of the year in a curio shelf. But I think even when the Bible [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=207.2s)]
*  says in Luke 2, glory to God in the highest and peace on earth, goodwill [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  toward men, we've got to take the baby Jesus out of the manger and put him in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=218.08s)]
*  our hearts. And I think that's what we strive to do in our family. And we [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=222.56s)]
*  should do it in our neighborhoods, our communities, and maybe someday we can [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=226.16s)]
*  have peace on earth. Take the baby Jesus out of the manger and put him in our [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=229.92s)]
*  hearts. That is such a beautiful message. Thank you both so much for waking up [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=233.68s)]
*  and being with us this morning. I know that our viewers really appreciate it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=237.28s)]
*  Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Thank you. Mike and Janet Huckabee, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=240.24s)]
*  they're the best. Yeah. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZ_-uoaAT0&t=245.84s)]
