# 'Fox & Friends' notices Harris repeating same script
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0)
*  The one thing about her though, when she does these interviews, as she leaves, she must [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=0.0s)]
*  feel as successful, because she did not make news. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=3.54s)]
*  Some people look at it as an opportunity to tell your story. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  They look at it as the opposite. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Finish it off, don't make news, whether good or bad. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=10.94s)]
*  Look at this headline, Brian. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=14.08s)]
*  Harris's formula for national media interviews, don't make news. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=15.68s)]
*  And that's why she keeps saying the same phrases when she's asked what we're going to do for [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=19.96s)]
*  the economy, what are you going to do differently. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=23.04s)]
*  And she says a new generation of leadership, opportunity, economy, whatever that means. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=25.2s)]
*  You ask Donald Trump and he says, we're going to decrease your energy bills by 50% in the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  first 12 months. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=36.12s)]
*  We're going to be energy independent, I mean dependent, independent, energy independent [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=37.12s)]
*  again like we used to be. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=42.76s)]
*  And he gives specifics, but she doesn't. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=44.56s)]
*  She does these phrases. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  I don't know how they affect any of us. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  So the stump speech is like her interviews. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=51.2s)]
*  You want proof? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=53.68s)]
*  We got it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=55.28s)]
*  Hit play. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=56.28s)]
*  So I was raised as a middle class kid. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=57.94s)]
*  I grew up a middle class kid. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=61.4s)]
*  I grew up a middle class kid. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=62.88s)]
*  I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=64.32s)]
*  You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=69.44s)]
*  The ambition, the aspiration, the dream. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=73.48s)]
*  I started my career as a prosecutor. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=76.32s)]
*  I was a career prosecutor for most of my career. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=78.64s)]
*  Having a background as a prosecutor. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  I intend to create an opportunity economy. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  Developing and creating an opportunity economy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  What I imagine and believe in, Cole, an opportunity economy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=90.76s)]
*  So she has certain themes and she has certain topics and certain phrases that she has practiced [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=96.22s)]
*  because as we know, the whole idea, because she has not been very good, extemporaneously [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  speaking, is to stick to the script. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=110.28s)]
*  And they've put together a script of just barebone stuff, a lot of generalities, few [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  specific things just to keep her on message because they would prefer her not to make [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  any news just so that they can go, oh, but on the Republican side, those guys are saying [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=125.36s)]
*  the crazy stuff. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=130.32s)]
*  But that strategy is making news because we're sitting here talking about how what are these, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=131.32s)]
*  how does this help us that she's a career prosecutor, an opportunity economy, a middle [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=134.24s)]
*  class kid. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=138.6s)]
*  I believe in ambition. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=139.64s)]
*  But okay, I'll vote for you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=140.84s)]
*  I'm against ambition. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=142.48s)]
*  So that's where I differ. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=143.48s)]
*  If you look at Kamala Harris in 2018 and before, you see a much different Kamala Harris. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=144.48s)]
*  She can talk off the cuff. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=151.6s)]
*  If you look at her committee hearings when she's on the TAC, she really goes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=153.24s)]
*  It's after 2018 when she accepted a nomination to be the vice president, when they tried [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=156.9s)]
*  to remake her that you see a different Kamala Harris because it's not her. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=163.2s)]
*  It's them feeding her lines what to say. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=167.28s)]
*  The only issue where she just dominates on is when she's talking about Roe v. Wade because [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=169.28s)]
*  she can still talk from her heart from that position. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=174.04s)]
*  Every other issue, whether it's the economy, it's the border, it's lines that she's being [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=177.56s)]
*  fed by the administration and what the pollsters have focused group to say she's not herself [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=182.4s)]
*  with those moments. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=188.84s)]
*  Can you imagine if your coach says we're a better team when you don't touch the ball? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=189.84s)]
*  That's what they're saying. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=194.2s)]
*  We are so much better when you don't have the ball in your head. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=195.2s)]
*  You're going to get a trophy if you just listen to me. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=198.24s)]
*  You're going to be a decoy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=200.44s)]
*  You're going to be a decoy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=201.44s)]
*  We'll give it to the other guy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=202.44s)]
*  Pretend you have a concussion. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=203.44s)]
*  Well, another way to put that, Brian, is don't mess it up because they feel they've got a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=206.44s)]
*  good message and you know enough about the message, so don't mess it up and say something [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=211.28s)]
*  that then we've got to explain. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  I kind of feel like I could relate to this because I think every coach said that to me. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=217.28s)]
*  Get on the bench. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=221.44s)]
*  Yeah, don't get the ball. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=222.44s)]
*  You're going to be the last one picked, but sit there and wait your turn. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=223.44s)]
*  But what they're doing is it's like telling Tom Brady don't touch the ball. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=228.72s)]
*  You are the one that's supposed to win the championship. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=231.96s)]
*  That's true. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=234.12s)]
*  So you can't, this has never been done before. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=235.12s)]
*  The problem is your regular season was the primaries, as I continue with this analogy. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=237.16s)]
*  You didn't have it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=241.18s)]
*  They crowned a champion. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=242.34s)]
*  You weren't in the game. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=243.44s)]
*  They took the crown away and gave it to you and they tell you don't drop the crown. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=244.44s)]
*  And there's no chin strap. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=250.08s)]
*  I'm going to continue. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=251.08s)]
*  But the problem is, the problem is Tom Brady's backup, but his backup was like the last one [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=252.08s)]
*  ever picked. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=257.4s)]
*  And when Tom dropped out, they didn't have a second or third string. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  So they just have to put you in. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=261.56s)]
*  I think Ainsley helped me here. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=262.76s)]
*  She did help me. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=264.08s)]
*  I think it really surprised me. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=265.08s)]
*  She is the daughter of a coach. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=266.08s)]
*  So just give her a moment. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=268.08s)]
*  That's about all I've got. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=269.08s)]
*  That's about all I've got. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=270.08s)]
*  I asked my dad, dad, why didn't you ever teach me to play basketball? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=271.08s)]
*  Lawrence is asking me this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  You're a basketball, college basketball coach. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=274.91999999999996s)]
*  And he said, you and your sister, there was no shot. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=276.96s)]
*  I wasn't going to waste my time. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=280.03999999999996s)]
*  to catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViabgjKzRp0&t=287.4s)]
