# IDF forces find info on Hamas hostages inside hospital
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c)
*  Fox News alert now. Right now Israeli forces are still inside Gaza's largest hospital at this hour carrying out focused searches. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=0.0s)]
*  The ongoing effort comes after the IDF says it found weapons and a laptop that contains pictures of hostages taken by Hamas. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=9.0s)]
*  Let's go to our own Trey Yanks live in southern Israel. Trey, what can you tell us? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=16.0s)]
*  Hey guys, good morning. The raid of Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital continues today. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=21.0s)]
*  Overnight we joined Israeli special forces inside the hospital on the front line between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=27.0s)]
*  In the dark of night, flanked by Israeli special forces, we move quickly into Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=34.0s)]
*  You can hear the Israelis are engaged in gun battles here with Hamas. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=43.0s)]
*  Down a hallway in the radiology department, soldiers point to piles of weapons and Hamas booklets as evidence the building was used for military purposes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=49.0s)]
*  Behind an MRI machine, more guns and ammunition. The Israelis say are part of Hamas grab bags that were feet away from injured Palestinians. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=59.0s)]
*  In terms of the patients here, there are hundreds of Palestinian civilians, more than a thousand internally displaced Gazans. Are they being protected? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=68.0s)]
*  First of all, they are unharmed, which is very important to state. No Palestinian civilian was even hurt, injured in yesterday's activity. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=77.0s)]
*  As part of our embed, Israeli forces controlled what areas of the hospital we could report from. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=87.0s)]
*  You can hear those gun battles raging on outside of the hospital grounds. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=93.0s)]
*  Leaving the hospital beneath the roar of Israeli drones, light from inside one of the buildings illuminates a path. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=98.0s)]
*  Back in an armored personnel carrier, we head to a staging area before switching vehicles. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=105.0s)]
*  Taking jeeps across Gaza provides a glimpse at the destruction along the strip. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=110.0s)]
*  With entire neighborhoods destroyed, many Palestinians will have no homes to return to. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=115.0s)]
*  Despite the rising civilian death toll and widespread destruction, the Israelis plan to continue their military campaign until Hamas is destroyed and the hostages are freed. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=120.0s)]
*  You saw those weapons in the radiology department. However, you did not see any sort of tunnels underneath Al-Shifa. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=132.0s)]
*  The Israelis say they are there, but they've not yet provided any images or locations. Guys, back to you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=139.0s)]
*  All right. So Trey, they got intel about the equipment, the weaponry. What about any intel regarding the hostages, which the world is worried about? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=145.0s)]
*  Absolutely. We learned a lot last night about the information the Israelis have gathered as a result of the raid on the Al-Shifa complex. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=157.0s)]
*  I want you to listen to Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Konrikis, who was on that in bed inside Gaza City. He describes what they found. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=166.0s)]
*  This bag is from the MRI center. All of this here was taken there, was found there, and we're bringing it out for processing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=174.0s)]
*  That's why we didn't leave it there. Handwritten notes and a computer where we found pictures and video of hostages and of Hamas combatants that are being interrogated. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=182.0s)]
*  Jonathan, just on these you said you found names of hostages. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=195.0s)]
*  Pictures of hostages and what appears to be, at a very quick glance, files of hostages. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=199.0s)]
*  Quite a significant development there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=207.0s)]
*  And if I could thank my cameraman, Yaniv Terjiman, and our security team member, Sean Nolan, for their support in this operation overnight inside Gaza. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=212.0s)]
*  Guys, back to you. Yeah, Trey, that is very brave of you to go in. We appreciate that footage. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=221.0s)]
*  I'm glad you're safe. When he said he saw the pictures of the hostages, could he tell? Were they in a tunnel? Were they in a house? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=226.0s)]
*  So he said he was able to find information about the hostages. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=233.0s)]
*  One photo we know was of an Israeli soldier that was actually rescued by her fellow soldiers who went into Gaza and raided an apartment earlier in the war. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=240.0s)]
*  So it appears much of the information focuses around the names and ID numbers of the hostages, along with some photos. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=250.0s)]
*  But the Israelis say they delivered laptops and the books to the intelligence service of Israel, and they're currently going through that information as we speak. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=256.0s)]
*  All right. Trey, you're reporting live from Israel. Thank you very much. Thank you, Trey. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_SgNY8xn4c&t=264.0s)]
