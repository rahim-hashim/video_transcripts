# Media stunned: Poll shows GOP gaining ground on who ‘cares about people’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E)
*  Back at CNN, CNN is actually looking at the numbers and has discovered that the Republican Party is in a better position than it has been in decades and cannot believe it. Watch this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=0.0s)]
*  Take a look. Cares more about the needs for people like you. We got a tie even after this tariff war had already started, split between Democrats and Republicans on how people feel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=15.6s)]
*  Which party cares more for needs of people like you? And why is that so surprising? Because I want you to take a look at prior years. Democrats always lead on this question. All of a sudden, the Democrats who are the party of the people no more. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=24.88s)]
*  So this question, who cares more about people like you, is generally regarded as the most important question in politics, because whoever is seen as caring more about people like you is always has a stronger hand. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=40.08s)]
*  Democrats have always been sort of the mommy party, and so they've always dominated in this. And Republicans were the daddy party. So if it was a question of security, you would run to the Republicans. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=54.32s)]
*  Now, under Donald Trump, he's completely erased the advantage Democrats have historically had on who do you care about, who cares more about people like me. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=66.24s)]
*  What's amazing is Harry Inton feels like all he does now for CNN is tell CNN viewers things that they can't believe. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=77.6s)]
*  The way he always addresses the camera, he's like, you're not going to believe this. And all of you watching it are saying, I kind of believe it. You know, Trump got elected, he won the popular vote. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  He's done a pretty good job in the first 90 days, and most of you watching are going to say that. But every time he addresses the camera, it's as if he's delivering a mind blowing earth shattering revelation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  Can you imagine him at the water cooler? Everybody over there hates him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  You weren't supposed to say that. You weren't supposed to show that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  The anchor who stands beside him always has to look surprised. Right? Like, oh, wow, he's really popular. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=109.28s)]
*  But you know what? They are in that bubble and they are surprised. The point is that if you're saying, I really believe that illegal should be, that RENDI ARAGUA should stay in our country. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=114.88s)]
*  Let's bring them back. Let's actually fight to bring them back. Or I really think illegal immigrants should vote in our election. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=125.84s)]
*  I'm going to vote against having citizens show their IDs and prove that they're citizens before their vote. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=132.24s)]
*  Or if you say, I'm on the side of China when it comes to tariffs. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  Like, you know, all of this stuff is it's just it's mind blowing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=142.08s)]
*  And all Donald Trump has done is steal their issues and didn't steal it in a, you know, sort of political disingenuous way. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=146.08s)]
*  He actually was a Democrat who believed these things since the 80s and said people are ripping us off. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=157.36s)]
*  And he is he's basically doing everything the Democrats for decades have said they wanted to do, but actually joined with the UNI party in basically screwing over the working class. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  And Donald Trump is saying, no, this is my second term. I'm older. I'm wiser. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=175.88000000000002s)]
*  I've got better people and I'm not going to sit around and deal with your you know what, like I did in the first term and all your Russia Russia Russia hoaxes. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=181.04s)]
*  I'm in month two and three dealing with the issue that should have been done decades ago. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  That's why I think he's got those numbers, guys. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=196.76s)]
*  I think that's 100 percent right. And also, it's basic common sense to your point. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=199.16s)]
*  It's not even nakedly partisan in any way. It's just rational. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=202.72s)]
*  The party of the working and he came in the front door. Nothing underhanded about it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  No, when the popular vote and the electoral vote. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=210.08s)]
*  So now no one can say anything and he's doing what he said he was going to do. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=212.4s)]
*  It still drives him crazy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=215.72s)]
*  It does. That clip from CNN was great. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=217.12s)]
*  You're so right, Clay, that everyone at CNN is. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=219.56s)]
*  They're still grappling with winning all the battleground states and dominating and American people responding well to it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=223.44s)]
*  And frankly, they're having trouble getting out of bed in the morning. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=229.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's fun to watch. It is really fun. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyPt7zUES4E&t=231.88000000000002s)]
