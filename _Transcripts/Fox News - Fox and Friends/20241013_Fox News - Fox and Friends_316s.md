# GOP lawmakers call on Navy to drop inquiry into SEAL commander after recruits’ death
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y)
*  All right, Republican lawmakers, including our next guest, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=0.0s)]
*  are calling on the Defense Department, the Navy specifically, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=2.88s)]
*  to allow a Navy SEAL commander to retire honorably [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=5.96s)]
*  after an initial probe found that he was not at fault [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=10.24s)]
*  for the death of a trainee during the infamous Hell Week back in 2022. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=13.68s)]
*  Former Navy SEAL Team Six commander, GOP Congressman Ryan Zinke joins us now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=19.2s)]
*  Congressman, thanks for being here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=24.2s)]
*  Kind of a redo from yesterday. We were going to talk about it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  We had some technical issues. We are back. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=27.28s)]
*  So the commander's name is Captain Brad Geary, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=30.4s)]
*  and the candidate who died, his name is Seaman Kyle Mullen. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=34.0s)]
*  The initial investigation was that he was not at fault. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  They, as we've seen happen with the military, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=41.24s)]
*  they went back and redid it and found a different result. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=44.56s)]
*  Why did you submit this letter? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Why are you concerned about what the Navy is doing in this circumstance? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=49.28s)]
*  Well, I come from a perspective that I was a SEAL Team instructor on first phase, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=53.2s)]
*  both on the basic and instructor side. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=58.0s)]
*  And the training itself is designed to be very, very difficult, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=60.64s)]
*  obviously, to test, but not made. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=65.56s)]
*  But when you introduce other things in the training, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=68.64s)]
*  performance as in drugs, you have the things that are outside [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=71.76s)]
*  the control of a commanding officer, certainly outside the control of the instructors. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=76.12s)]
*  And then I think you need to take a look at it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=80.6s)]
*  And look, there are five SEALs in the House of Representatives. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=82.6s)]
*  We're going to have six in the one in the Senate. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=86.72000000000001s)]
*  And they also we have two special forces that we're going to move that to four. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=89.56s)]
*  And when you look at it, you know, the responsibility of a commanding officer, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=93.92s)]
*  what we're calling on is the secretary of Navy to take another look at it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  We think this this commanding officer was in the right. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  But we want to look at it to make sure and do the right thing and let him retire. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=107.64000000000001s)]
*  And that means a lot. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=112.84s)]
*  I mean, it's a difficult spot to take a stand if the Navy has come to a result, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=113.68s)]
*  if you haven't been there and the fact that you have and many others have [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=119.0s)]
*  and then you're willing to put put your money where your mouth is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=121.92s)]
*  and put it in a letter, say, hey, let's check this investigation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=124.68s)]
*  And you mentioned it briefly. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=126.68s)]
*  It apparently the Navy did very little to analyze performance enhancing drugs [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  like HGH and testosterone that were found in Mullen's car [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=133.52s)]
*  in the investigation, instead saying it was just the training was too tough. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=139.12s)]
*  Did you find anything in your initial assessment that this commander of the BUDS [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  training went beyond what is I've never been to BUDS, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  but I know it's extraordinarily difficult. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, I fall back on my experience. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  There was unfortunately there was a couple of deaths during the training. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=158.72s)]
*  And in every case, it was a result of either [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  in federal performance, enhancing drugs or steroids. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=165.12s)]
*  You look at the training's heart and the training's design, not the main, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=168.24s)]
*  but the test. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=173.44s)]
*  But again, when you introduce other drugs into that, that evolutions, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=174.6s)]
*  you know, the case of the Fedra, the chances of an elevated body temperature, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=181.2s)]
*  sunstroke, heat stroke is a lot more pronounced. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=185.8s)]
*  And again, the training is designed to go for a student is tough, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=189.6s)]
*  but it's not taken in enhancing performance drugs. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=194.24s)]
*  And in this case, it's beyond what the commanding officer could perceive, I think. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=198.2s)]
*  But again, we're asking for the Department of Navy, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  specifically the secretary to take another look at it and do the right thing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  We're going to stay in this case because when commanders are not given the latitude [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=212.16000000000003s)]
*  to lead the way they ought, training changes or gets softer. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=215.72s)]
*  And as a result, you have less prepared [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=220.88s)]
*  SEALs or soldiers on the other side of it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=223.12s)]
*  By the way, we asked the Navy for a statement on this specifically. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=225.28s)]
*  This is what they said. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  They said, as a result of the investigation into the oversight and management of Bud's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=230.0s)]
*  class 352 and circumstances surrounding the death of Seaman Mullen, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=233.36s)]
*  the Navy is proceeding with accountability actions. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=237.56s)]
*  Given these actions are administrative and ongoing, it would be inappropriate [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=239.44s)]
*  to comment further. You're simply saying, hey, take another look at this case. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=242.16s)]
*  And by the way, I hope you succeed in more SEALs, more special operators [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=246.44s)]
*  in the House. We need it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=251.28s)]
*  So, Congressman, I think America realizes a very difficult mission. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=253.08s)]
*  And there are unfortunate tragedies during the training. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=256.8s)]
*  And that's unfortunately a part of life. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=261.32s)]
*  We could do what we can to make sure, again, the training tests, but doesn't [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=263.36s)]
*  man or kill. But look, the mission is tough out there. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=266.4s)]
*  And as a former commander, you go to the front line, the front lines, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=270.36s)]
*  the instructors that actually do it, and you support the front line [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  because, you know, they are the ones that have to fight with the kids [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=276.68s)]
*  they put through training, the candidates. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=280.44s)]
*  And this is serious business. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=281.96s)]
*  We face a lot of challenges and difficulties across the globe [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=283.24s)]
*  and we need our best foot forward. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=287.04s)]
*  You know it and you've lived it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=289.6s)]
*  Congressman Ryan Zinke, thank you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=291.2s)]
*  Good luck in a couple of weeks. Appreciate it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=292.48s)]
*  Always a pleasure, Pete. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  I look forward to talking to you and bringing you out to Montana. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=295.36s)]
*  Come on out to Montana. Enjoy. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=298.48s)]
*  Deal. Deal. I was out there this summer. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=300.88s)]
*  I'm coming back again. You got it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=302.36s)]
*  Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=304.36s)]
*  And most compelling analysis. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjqgmhuPU2Y&t=313.24s)]
