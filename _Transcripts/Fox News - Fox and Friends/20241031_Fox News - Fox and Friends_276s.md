# Elon Musk touts MASSIVE spending cuts if Trump wins
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I)
*  Meanwhile, the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, laying out his vision for major government [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=0.0s)]
*  spending cuts if former President Donald Trump winds up president again. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=5.22s)]
*  How much do you think we can rip out of this wasted $6.5 trillion Harris-Biden budget? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=11.68s)]
*  Well, I think we can do at least $2 trillion. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=19.72s)]
*  That's a big number. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=24.0s)]
*  Our next guest is promising to work with Musk to get this done if he becomes Treasury Secretary. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=25.0s)]
*  During a second Trump administration, Paulson and Company founder and President John Paulson [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=29.92s)]
*  joins us right now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=36.6s)]
*  John, good morning to you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=37.6s)]
*  Hey, good morning, Steve. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=38.6s)]
*  Steve, I'll give you one good way to bring down spending because we just saw that clip. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=39.6s)]
*  The government is now subsidizing to the tune of $1 trillion the Green New Energy Deal. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  That's subsidies for electric vehicles, subsidies for solar panels, subsidies for wind. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  My question is, why should the average, the hardworking Americans pay taxes, give it [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  to the government, and the government gives it to a car buyer in California or homeowner [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=63.08s)]
*  in California to subsidize their purchase of an electric vehicle? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=68.53999999999999s)]
*  That's not fair to the people that aren't driving electric vehicles. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=73.16s)]
*  I'm all for electric vehicles, but I don't think the government should take your tax [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=76.52s)]
*  dollars to subsidize that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=81.82s)]
*  By eliminating those subsidies, that eliminates a trillion in spending right there. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=84.2s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=88.64s)]
*  It also brings down costs. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=89.64s)]
*  Ultimately... [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=92.2s)]
*  That's just one example of spending cuts that would benefit Americans. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=93.2s)]
*  John, you know Elon Musk is really good at efficiency. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=97.84s)]
*  He runs his companies very efficiently, so it would be great to have him take his set [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=101.68s)]
*  of eyes and say, okay, we could do this, we could do that, we could do something else. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=108.34s)]
*  But of course, some people are like, I hope he doesn't chop important social programs [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=112.18s)]
*  or things that people are relying on. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=117.48s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  I'll give you another example. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  The federal government was estimated to have paid $150 billion for illegal immigrants last [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=125.74s)]
*  year, all sorts of subsidized programs. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  One way to reduce spending, and Trump has made a commitment, no federal benefits for [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=136.26s)]
*  illegal immigrants. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=141.22s)]
*  There's another $150 billion that could come out of the budget, preserve the tax dollars [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=142.54000000000002s)]
*  to support Americans, but not for illegal immigrants. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=146.86s)]
*  You make a good point. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=150.62s)]
*  You know, a billion here, a billion there, it suddenly adds up to some real money. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=151.62s)]
*  John, there's an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, and essentially it says this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=155.62s)]
*  As far as policies and coalition go, she, Kamala Harris, is running for what essentially [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=160.66s)]
*  would be Barack Obama's fourth progressive term. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  Many Americans see all this and will still vote for Ms. Harris because they think four [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=168.88s)]
*  more years of Mr. Trump is a bigger risk. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=173.32s)]
*  But voters also have to cause to fear the bloody mindlessness of the modern left with [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  its regulatory coercion, cultural imperialism, economic statism, and desire to strip judicial [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=183.46s)]
*  independence. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=190.44s)]
*  If Ms. Harris loses, this will be the reason. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=191.44s)]
*  We've thought about it being Joe Biden 2.0, but a lot of people don't think about it as [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=195.22s)]
*  a fourth version of the Obama year. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=200.9s)]
*  Yeah, good point, Steve. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=203.22s)]
*  I think in terms, you just have to look at how the economy did under Trump to get a good [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=206.12s)]
*  look at how we're going to do again under Trump. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=212.70000000000002s)]
*  Inflation was low, only 1.9%. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  Under Biden, it's been over 5.7%. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=218.82000000000002s)]
*  Real wages grew under Trump. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=222.42000000000002s)]
*  They declined under Biden. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=224.26s)]
*  So electricity costs are up almost 30%. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  They were stable under Trump. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=230.56s)]
*  So when Trump's elected, we will again have rising real wages, lower inflation, lower [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  cost of utilities, lower cost of housing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=238.76s)]
*  That's going to benefit everyone. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  He has the track record to prove it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=242.92s)]
*  The opposite happened under Biden-Harris. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=244.72s)]
*  You know, and one of the things that people hate about taxes is we pay our hard-earned [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  tax money to Washington and then Washington wastes it on stuff that is not efficient. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  Maybe in a second Trump term, that will all change. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=257.9s)]
*  We'll see what happens by next week. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=260.82s)]
*  John Paulson, thank you very much for joining us today. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfIczCo_J1I&t=263.38s)]
