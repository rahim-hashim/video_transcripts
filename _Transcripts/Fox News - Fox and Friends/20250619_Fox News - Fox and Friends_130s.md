# Justice Thomas issues devastating opinion: This is a 'simple lesson'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8)
*  In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court upholding Tennessee's law banning certain medical treatments [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=0.0s)]
*  for transgender minors. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=8.64s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson has the details. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=10.68s)]
*  Lucas? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=12.32s)]
*  Well, good morning, Ainsley. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=13.32s)]
*  It was a highly anticipated ruling with implications nationwide. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=14.32s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruling to uphold a Tennessee law banning medical procedures, including [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=17.84s)]
*  puberty blockers, to transition minors to another sex. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=22.5s)]
*  Clarence Thomas writing, quote, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  This case carries a simple lesson. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=29.16s)]
*  In politically contentious debates over matters shrouded in scientific uncertainty, courts [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=30.88s)]
*  should not assume that self-described experts are correct. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=36.08s)]
*  The ruling drew protesters outside the Supreme Court yesterday. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=40.16s)]
*  Earlier on Fox and Friends First, an attorney in California says more states should follow [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=43.76s)]
*  suit after this Supreme Court ruling. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=48.2s)]
*  Right now we have 27 states that have restrictions on gender interventions on children. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=51.6s)]
*  Gavin Newsom and his attorney general already have stated that they're going to continue [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  to push forward with gender interventions on kids. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=65.84s)]
*  So the blue states need help. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=70.08s)]
*  So we need congressional action. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=71.68s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi posting, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=75.88s)]
*  I applaud today's Supreme Court decision that allows states to protect vulnerable children [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=77.44s)]
*  from genital mutilation and other so-called gender-affirming care that leaves children [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=82.56s)]
*  permanently disfigured and scarred. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=88.12s)]
*  Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one of three justices who dissented, writes, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=91.12s)]
*  By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the court abandons [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=95.28s)]
*  transgender children and their families to political whims. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=100.84s)]
*  In sadness, I dissent. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=104.72s)]
*  The Supreme Court's ruling and the next steps likely involve legal challenges to similar [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=107.32s)]
*  bans in other states, including funding for these kinds of transgender procedures. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=110.91999999999999s)]
*  Griff? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=115.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=116.6s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson in Washington. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=117.6s)]
*  Lucas, thank you. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJQEsZZytT8&t=118.6s)]
