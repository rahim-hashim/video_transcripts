# Pro-Palestinian protesters arrested during Capitol Hill tree lighting
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA)
*  New York City police bracing for thousands of anti-Israel protesters set to flood Rockefeller [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=0.0s)]
*  Center in New York City tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=7.76s)]
*  Brooke Singman is here with more. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=9.44s)]
*  Hi Brooke. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=11.0s)]
*  Hey guys, yeah the New York City Police Department is not taking any chances tonight. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=12.0s)]
*  They're vowing to quote protect the tree lighting and all of those attending. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  They say they will not tolerate disruption or any threats to public safety. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=18.96s)]
*  Now this announcement comes after this flyer was spotted on social media. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=23.16s)]
*  It calls for protesters to quote flood the tree lighting for Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=27.48s)]
*  But the NYPD does not believe that this is going to be the end. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=31.68s)]
*  They actually are anticipating more demonstrations in the coming days and weeks. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=34.72s)]
*  We have seen a surge in these kinds of protests disrupting high profile events across the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=39.88s)]
*  city and the nation over the past month. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=44.5s)]
*  Protesters disrupted the Macy's Thanksgiving parade last week. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  At least 34 people were arrested after blocking the parade path. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=51.24s)]
*  They were throwing fake blood and they even glued their hands to the pavement. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=55.24s)]
*  And most recently actually just last night during the tree lighting on Capitol Hill, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=59.48s)]
*  pro-Palestinian demonstrators heckled House Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=63.48s)]
*  Listen to them here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=67.16s)]
*  All piece of your state's abundant beauty with us in Washington. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=68.16s)]
*  Also want to thank Chief Randy Moore with the US Forest Service. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=72.28s)]
*  Jim Coughlin. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=77.32s)]
*  Yeah, four people were then arrested and removed from the crowd by Capitol Hill police. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=78.32s)]
*  They've been charged with disorderly conduct. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  And meanwhile, the NYPD is warning that these malicious actors may view mass gatherings [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=86.28s)]
*  at high profile events and even iconic locations like the tree lighting tonight at Rockefeller [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=90.88s)]
*  Center as targets of opportunity at the holiday season. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=95.72s)]
*  Guys. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  Okay, Brooke Lye, for us. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuFwEz_FiYA&t=101.24000000000001s)]
