# Israel responds after Hezbollah's deadliest attack since Oct 7
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM)
*  Starting with a Fox News alert, Israel striking back in Hezbollah after the Iranian-backed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=0.0s)]
*  terror group launched the deadliest attack on the Jewish state since October 7th on Saturday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=9.08s)]
*  Trey Yengst, our colleague, joins us live from that Israeli town hit by the attack. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=15.44s)]
*  Trey, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys, good morning. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=22.04s)]
*  Right now we are in the Jeruz community of Majd al-Shamz in the Golan Heights at the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=24.9s)]
*  site of that rocket attack that took the lives of 12 young people just yesterday. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=29.82s)]
*  I want to show you the scene here, a scene of pure devastation. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=35.3s)]
*  We arrived this morning as funerals were taking place. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=38.7s)]
*  A small community mourning the loss of these young lives. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  There were scooters here and bicycles. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Kids were playing soccer when a Hezbollah rocket slammed into this field. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  You can see the impact site right here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=54.78s)]
*  To describe what took place here is to describe a massacre. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  We spoke with a doctor during the funeral who was one of the first responders to this [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=61.56s)]
*  attack yesterday and he said he desperately tried to save a 10-year-old boy who was covered [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=65.62s)]
*  in shrapnel wounds and he was unsuccessful. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=70.78s)]
*  We spoke with a father whose young daughter was killed in the explosion, this rocket attack [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=73.48s)]
*  launched by Hezbollah yesterday. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=80.36s)]
*  Speaking with this father, I asked him how he found out that she was killed and he said [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=82.38000000000001s)]
*  he tried to call her again and again and the phone was busy and he arrived here at this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=88.02000000000001s)]
*  field and his 10-year-old was lying dead here among so many other children. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  It gives you a sense of just how violent and catastrophic these events are. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=97.18s)]
*  As we speak, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is preparing to convene the Israeli [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=101.46000000000001s)]
*  cabinet. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=106.34s)]
*  We expect a major Israeli response to the Iran-backed group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=107.34s)]
*  Officials speaking with Fox News overnight say they are preparing for what could be days [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=113.14s)]
*  and days of cross-border exchanges. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=117.76s)]
*  This is very much a turning point in the ongoing conflict that started between Israel and Hezbollah [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  on October 8th, just one day after the October 7th massacre. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=125.5s)]
*  Guys back to you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=129.46s)]
*  Trey, thank you so much for bringing us that information and showing us that horrific scene [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=130.46s)]
*  where there's been so much tragedy there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=134.94s)]
*  I think we still have Trey, if we could pull him back up so we can ask him a couple of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=137.26s)]
*  questions, is that right? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=141.01999999999998s)]
*  You talk about how this could spark a wider war. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=145.06s)]
*  That is the major concern. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=148.22s)]
*  We say that Israel is fighting a one-front war right now. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=151.26s)]
*  That's not really true. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  Hezbollah in the northern border has always been an issue. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=155.29999999999998s)]
*  But there is concern that things could escalate. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=158.34s)]
*  How much concern is there in Israel and what does that mean for us here in the United States? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  Look, there is major concern about the possibility of a broader war between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=166.06s)]
*  Already over the past several months, Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into northern [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  Israel, but they've stopped short of targeting major cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=177.78s)]
*  If the Israelis go on the offensive tonight and strike targets around Beirut or other [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=182.78s)]
*  Hezbollah strongholds, it could be another step up on the escalation ladder. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=187.82s)]
*  What officials here on the ground tell us is no other choice but to respond following [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=192.54s)]
*  the tragic attack that took the lives of 12 young people. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=197.34s)]
*  When you speak with the civilians here, they paint a picture of anger and deep frustration [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=202.38s)]
*  about the ongoing attacks, the rocket fire and the drone attacks that have been launched [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  by Hezbollah that have really been nonstop over the past 10 months. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=213.9s)]
*  The question here is how Israel will respond. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=218.98s)]
*  It is not a matter of if, but rather when, and if that response will draw more rocket [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=221.22s)]
*  fire into northern Israel and possibly deeper into the country. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=225.98s)]
*  But I go back to the individuals here on the ground in Majd al-Shamz and speaking with [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=229.94s)]
*  that father. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=235.89999999999998s)]
*  He told me he is prepared to fight. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=237.1s)]
*  So many of the community members here along the Lebanon border say if the Israeli government [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=239.45999999999998s)]
*  and military don't make a decision to bring the fight to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=243.9s)]
*  they will do so themselves. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=248.94s)]
*  They are really beyond frustrated about what has taken place over the past 10 months and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=250.58s)]
*  this tragic incident yesterday, a rocket attack against young soccer players, kids that were [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=255.26s)]
*  here just trying to enjoy their evening, really highlights the devastation in this ongoing [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=260.78000000000003s)]
*  war. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=265.66s)]
*  What can you tell us about the early response from the IDF into Lebanon? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=266.82000000000005s)]
*  Has that been fairly limited and do you expect more? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=274.78000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=278.74s)]
*  We understand that what you saw overnight, some of the artillery activity along the border [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  between northern Israel and southern Lebanon, along with some of the airstrikes that continue [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=285.38s)]
*  to take place even at this hour, this is not even the initial response by the Israelis [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=290.22s)]
*  against Hezbollah. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=296.26s)]
*  This is simply the ongoing really back and forth that we have seen along the border here [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=297.58s)]
*  over the past 10 months. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=302.74s)]
*  There will be a significant response, a direct response to the attack that killed these 12 [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=304.46s)]
*  innocent people yesterday and we do expect that to happen following the cabinet meeting [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=310.82s)]
*  likely in the nighttime hours with Israeli jets in the skies of Lebanon. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  Trey, there's been so much attention obviously put on Hamas and Gaza in the south and much [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=320.06s)]
*  of the conflict in the north has been basically ignored by the international community because [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=326.46s)]
*  despite all those attacks that you mentioned, they haven't really been successful in the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=330.78s)]
*  sense that there haven't been innocent people killed. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=335.29999999999995s)]
*  That changed yesterday in a horrific way. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=337.76s)]
*  Is there a sense of why this rocket attack hit civilians and actually was able to penetrate [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=340.34s)]
*  Israeli defenses? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=346.78s)]
*  Yes, so the Israelis are still investigating how this Iran-made rocket actually made its [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=350.29999999999995s)]
*  way to this location because as we know, there's a lot of air defense in this area. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=355.7s)]
*  Israel's close-range missile defense, the Iron Dome, is often active along the border [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=360.58s)]
*  with Lebanon and there have been questions, including questions on a military briefing [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=365.62s)]
*  that I was on last night, about why this rocket wasn't intercepted. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=369.76s)]
*  Now the initial explanation by the Israeli military has to do with the trajectory of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=374.06s)]
*  the rocket. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=378.34000000000003s)]
*  It was fired at relatively close range to the border and also at the low altitude and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=379.34000000000003s)]
*  so it made it hard to intercept. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=384.54s)]
*  The Israelis were not able to get off an Iron Dome interceptor round to try and stop the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=386.38s)]
*  rocket from landing in this community. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=390.7s)]
*  We also have to think about the proximity to Mazdal Shams to the border. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=392.92s)]
*  We are talking about a matter of seconds, even on a day where the sirens and alerts [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=396.3s)]
*  work in the right and correct manner and I just want to show you here because this is [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=401.46000000000004s)]
*  a really important part of the story. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=405.54s)]
*  How close we are to a bomb shelter and it is tragic. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=407.82s)]
*  It is simply tragic. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=412.09999999999997s)]
*  There's no other way to describe it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=413.38s)]
*  The impact site is here, the crater there and there's a bomb shelter right here and [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=414.7s)]
*  so these young children who were trying to get off the field when a brief siren did sound, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=418.82s)]
*  they were coming out of the doorway that we just exited from and that is when the rocket [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=425.74s)]
*  hit this area and the amount of shrapnel that we've seen across the ground here is also [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=430.1s)]
*  significant. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=434.94s)]
*  They're still going through the area trying to look for pieces of these kids and it is [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=436.26s)]
*  a horrific reality of this war but it is something that we have to bring to you because this [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=441.02s)]
*  is what Israel is dealing with and it is part of the reason you will see a massive Israeli [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=446.34s)]
*  response to this rocket attack by Hezbollah. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=451.08s)]
*  An attack that we should note, Hezbollah is claiming for the first time since this war [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=454.06s)]
*  began that they didn't launch but that's not true. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=457.78s)]
*  They absolutely launched this based on all the evidence that we have seen and all of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=460.9s)]
*  the intelligence gathered by the Israelis in the immediate aftermath of this strike [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=465.18s)]
*  yesterday in northern Israel. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=469.62s)]
*  And just to be clear on something you said a minute ago, the rocket was manufactured [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=471.34s)]
*  in Iran? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JD-IUA0IM&t=475.86s)]
