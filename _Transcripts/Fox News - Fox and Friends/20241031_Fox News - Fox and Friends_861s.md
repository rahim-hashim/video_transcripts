*  Well, we've been talking about the battlegrounds. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=0.0s)]
*  It all comes down to who is going to win the battlegrounds. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=2.04s)]
*  They will wind up being the president. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Pete is live in Romeo, Michigan today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=6.28s)]
*  And you're actually, it looks like you're in a tent. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=10.24s)]
*  You're in the overflow area, right? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=12.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=14.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=16.56s)]
*  Steve, we're in the parking lot. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=17.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=19.6s)]
*  Because there's such a big, and it's nice out here [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=20.96s)]
*  because it's a little bit cooler. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=23.2s)]
*  And we got a lot of folks in here who look like garbage. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=24.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=28.32s)]
*  I guess. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  Guys, we're in Romeo, Michigan, the Four Corners Diner, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=32.4s)]
*  McComb County. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=35.04s)]
*  They call it Trump County, I'm saying. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=36.0s)]
*  And I got to, this county went for Trump in 16 and 20. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  And by the way, it's Halloween. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=42.6s)]
*  And I didn't know this, but Romeo [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=44.64s)]
*  is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, Halloween [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=46.08s)]
*  town in America. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=49.08s)]
*  What's the name of the street here in town? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=52.08s)]
*  Tilson Street. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=54.08s)]
*  Tilson Street is where all the decorations are. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=55.2s)]
*  Apparently, it's just right down the road. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=57.76s)]
*  We'll have to check it out later on for decorations [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=59.44s)]
*  and for kids and everything else. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=61.92s)]
*  But this morning, we're talking to voters. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=63.32s)]
*  How many here have early voted here in Michigan? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=66.12s)]
*  OK, that's a lot. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  This is the first year ever there's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=70.52s)]
*  been early voting in the state of Michigan. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  Over 2 million, almost 2 million Michiganders [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  have cast an early vote. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=77.08s)]
*  Out of 8 million possible voters, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=78.68s)]
*  that's a big chunk six days away from election day. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=80.64s)]
*  But I want to get a sense of how this group, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  and we'll go talk to the other group as well, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=85.36s)]
*  is feeling about those comments. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=86.76s)]
*  I can't help but see this gentleman here [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=88.08s)]
*  wearing a reflective vest like the president did yesterday. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=90.12s)]
*  Have you ever actually used that to remove garbage? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=94.72s)]
*  Absolutely, picking up garbage along the side of the road [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  with cleaning up the highways and stuff like that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=99.76s)]
*  So what do you make of the comments made by Joe Biden [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  and the president's react? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=104.84s)]
*  Well, I think it speaks to what Joe Biden really thinks [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=106.36000000000001s)]
*  and Harris really thinks of the people in this country that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=109.28s)]
*  support Donald Trump. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=112.64s)]
*  And he's going to take out the garbage. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=116.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=116.62s)]

*  I mean, we need somebody back in office [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=131.32s)]
*  that cares about the American people, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=134.16s)]
*  not the administration that cares about themselves. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=136.72s)]
*  Ma'am, how about both of you? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=140.48000000000002s)]

*  I thought that was a bunch of garbage is what I thought. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=144.84s)]
*  I thought, oh my gosh, first we're deplorables, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=147.56s)]
*  and now we're garbage? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  No way. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=151.12s)]
*  We are the heartbeat of America. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=152.12s)]
*  We are the United States of America. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=154.24s)]
*  We are the Patriots. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=156.16000000000003s)]

*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=177.52s)]

*  then I don't care what you call me. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=190.4s)]

*  Not an easy job. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=220.12s)]
*  Not when the cans were metal and nobody put the lids on it [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  and the ice melted in them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=224.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's cold here in Michigan, taking out the trash. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=226.48000000000002s)]

*  Well, I think this lady over here [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=235.36s)]
*  said it best if she wants to repeat it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=237.28s)]
*  I don't want to take one back. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=239.84s)]

*  Her time has been deferred to you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=245.16s)]
*  All to be good. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4fbFwH-M5Q&t=247.56s)]
