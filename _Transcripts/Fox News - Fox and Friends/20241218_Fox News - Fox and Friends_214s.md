# 'ABSOLUTE TORTURE': Migrant gang continues to terrorize sanctuary city suburb
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo)
*  14 suspected Trendy Aragwa members were arrested [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=0.0s)]
*  after a violent home invasion in Aurora, Colorado, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=4.04s)]
*  where cops say two victims were kidnapped, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=6.94s)]
*  bound, one of them stabbed. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=9.56s)]
*  It happened at the same apartment complex, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=11.88s)]
*  remember that one, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=14.16s)]
*  where this armed takeover happened this summer [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=15.0s)]
*  back in August. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=17.32s)]
*  One Aurora councilwoman has been speaking out [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  from the beginning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=21.52s)]
*  I am tired of this being portrayed [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=24.64s)]
*  as just another gang in Aurora. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=27.16s)]
*  This is so heinous. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=30.28s)]
*  This is a whole different level and I am tired of it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=31.76s)]
*  I've been called a liar. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=35.4s)]
*  I've been told this was in my imagination. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=36.88s)]
*  This has been downplayed and people are suffering [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=39.08s)]
*  and I will not be silenced on this issue. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=41.72s)]
*  Well, that woman in that soundbite, Danielle Jurenski, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=45.56s)]
*  joins us right now from Aurora. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  Danielle, good morning to you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=51.32s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=53.2s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=54.6s)]
*  They called, when you were talking about [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=56.0s)]
*  simply things that had happened, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=58.32s)]
*  they called you essentially delusional, she's a liar, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  it's all your imagination. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=63.72s)]
*  You're not a liar, you're a truth teller [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=65.44s)]
*  and it was not your imagination. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=67.44s)]
*  That's right and it's interesting [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  because our governor was asked about his comments yesterday [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=72.98s)]
*  if he would like to update that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  And he really had nothing to say about this. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=78.4s)]
*  This is unfortunately not something [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=82.84s)]
*  that you want to be able to say I told you so on, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=85.56s)]
*  but I told you so and nobody wanted to listen to me. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=88.44s)]
*  This very much turned into political theater [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=92.4s)]
*  leading up to the presidential election [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  and many people have suffered. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  This isn't just assault. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  This isn't just fist fights. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=103.48s)]
*  This is absolute torture, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=105.04s)]
*  what some of these people have been going through. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  And once the Americans were moved out of the complex, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=110.76s)]
*  this is the most vulnerable population left. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=114.08s)]
*  These are other migrants who some of them [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=117.2s)]
*  don't even really realize where they are. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=119.68s)]
*  They were simply dropped off [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=122.96s)]
*  in the middle of the night in some cases. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=124.92s)]
*  Right and some of the torture regarding this home invasion, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  this most recent one there, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=131.6s)]
*  one of the people had their fingernails pulled out. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=133.68s)]
*  I mean, it's absolutely barbaric. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=136.32s)]
*  There's been a sea change though in Aurora [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=138.64s)]
*  because you've got a new police chief now [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=141.2s)]
*  who apparently is taking this more seriously. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=143.32s)]
*  He is. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=147.4s)]
*  He led a strong press conference. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=148.72s)]
*  Yesterday, the police response to these two victims was huge. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=152.2s)]
*  The police presence in this neighborhood right now is huge. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=158.48s)]
*  He has made clear that we will not stand for this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=162.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  It is a new day in the Aurora Police Chief's office. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=167.28s)]
*  Yeah and Danielle, before you go, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=170.36s)]
*  who is it who has wanted you to essentially be quiet? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=172.48s)]
*  Well, it's somewhere between the Aurora mayor, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=177.88s)]
*  the Denver mayor, the governor of Colorado, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=180.96s)]
*  and I think local liberal media. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=184.12s)]
*  They just don't want you to tell people [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=188.8s)]
*  what we can see with our own two eyes right there. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=190.84s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=194.4s)]
*  Upside down world. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=196.2s)]
*  Well, we appreciate your candor and your honesty [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=197.16s)]
*  and joining us today here on Fox and Friends. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=199.8s)]
*  Good luck to you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRsJrAD0yo&t=203.16s)]
