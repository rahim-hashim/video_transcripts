# Joe Rogan: The corruption is being weeded out
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI)
*  Federal workers now have until Monday to decide whether to take a buyout after a Clinton appointed judge [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=0.0s)]
*  Extended that deadline. I hope it ends there too. The move comes as nearly all [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=6.9s)]
*  USAID employees are reported to be laid off tonight with unions now suing the Trump administration [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=11.76s)]
*  Over the sweeping cuts they'll bet for over a thousand to three hundred [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=18.96s)]
*  Unbelievable Lucas Thomas and joins us live from Washington with the details. Good morning Lucas. Good morning guys [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=23.28s)]
*  Well, if you're a federal worker on the fence about taking the buyout [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=29.52s)]
*  You have some more time to think it over it [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=32.44s)]
*  Not the case for thousands of USAID workers who face a midnight deadline tonight. Here's Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the cuts [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=34.32s)]
*  We're not trying to be disruptive to people's personal lives. We're not this is we're not trying to we're not being punitive here [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=42.92s)]
*  But this is the only way we've been able to get cooperation from USAID [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=49.08s)]
*  I had preferred not to do it this way when we tried to do it from the top down [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  By getting cooperation from the central office of USAID [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=56.6s)]
*  What we found instead are people trying to use the system to sneak through payments and push through payments despite the stop order [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=59.96s)]
*  The United States will be providing foreign aid [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=66.4s)]
*  But it is going to be foreign aid that makes sense and is aligned with our national interest [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=68.4s)]
*  USAID is being folded into the State Department plans to keep only about [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=73.92s)]
*  290 employees more than ten thousand will lose their jobs tonight at midnight [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=78.6s)]
*  Unions representing the workers say these actions have generated a global humanitarian crisis by abruptly [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=83.48s)]
*  Halting the crucial work of USAID employees grantees and contractors [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=89.8s)]
*  They have cost thousands of American jobs and they have imperiled US national security interests [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=94.72s)]
*  Now the US Office of Personnel Management says in compliance with court order the deadline for federal employees to accept the deferred [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=100.3s)]
*  Resignation program is being extended to Monday February 10th [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=107.4s)]
*  1159 p.m. Eastern the program is not being blocked or canceled the government will honor the deferred resignation offer [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  Now we've put together a list of some of the things USAID is spending money on with your taxpayer dollars [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=119.58s)]
*  Perhaps we get a few more turns on the scroll there [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=126.86s)]
*  1,000,000 gender diverse support in Bangladesh 1.8 million for Honduran [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=130.66s)]
*  LGBT group [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=136.1s)]
*  Some of the bigger ticket items 15 million for condoms to the Taliban 19 millions assisting migrants in the Columbia [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=137.7s)]
*  The list goes on and on as you can see here 3.3 million for a Caribbean LGBT group [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=145.01999999999998s)]
*  29 million for young and female working eat the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=151.1s)]
*  Egyptians and 14.9 million for supporting [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=154.7s)]
*  LGBTQ youth in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=159.78s)]
*  Cambodia and 49 million for improving reading scores in Zambia [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=162.02s)]
*  Now some lawmakers on Capitol Hill guys seem to support USAID and that includes Mississippi Senator Roger wicker says USAID is [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=166.38s)]
*  Important to countering Chinese influence, but he also acknowledges some of these spending programs are a bit wasteful guys, right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=174.26s)]
*  Thanks so much Lucas [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=181.18s)]
*  So you would think it might work to their benefit to point out some of the programs that are dubious that point out other ones that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=182.5s)]
*  Necessary but instead they want to condemn people for bringing it up when as Mark Tieson writes today with perspective [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=188.74s)]
*  He said Warren Christopher a secretary of state under Bill Clinton was the first to say these guys are out of control [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=195.46s)]
*  Let's fold them into the State Department Al Gore was gonna do it, but he got massive pushback from USAID [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=201.26s)]
*  And they said okay, well fold senator [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=207.14s)]
*  Joni Ernst said what are you guys spending your money on you're looking so you're not even going for American causes [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=209.38s)]
*  You're going for America anti-american causes they threatened her down. They told her to back off and as Peggy Noonan writes [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=215.26s)]
*  She says of all the agencies being batted around this one will remember the first one [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=221.76s)]
*  We recall the period in history of the US agencies for international development [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=226.46s)]
*  Some of the whose line items were spending was devoted to cultural imperialism [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=230.1s)]
*  You have seen the list USAID produced DEI musical in Ireland and everything [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=234.42s)]
*  We just saw she says when you look at what they are pushing in the world you think they're not fighting [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=239.06s)]
*  Anti-american feelings they are causing anti-american feelings [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm stunned that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=247.88s)]
*  They have allowed the Republicans now to be the party of the people and when I say the people I mean the American people [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=249.92s)]
*  If they if there was an argument to be made of some program internationally [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=256.6s)]
*  That you want to fight for you could just go to the president Whitehouse [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=262.36s)]
*  They can we at least just keep this program, but that's not the argument that they're making [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=266.0s)]
*  They want to keep all of the programs from the USA even though it's fraud waste and abuse going on in place [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=270.36s)]
*  And I just don't think this is of course. I'm not gonna win against the Republic, but they're not gonna win with American people [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  They're not gonna have all these Americans calling and protesting to keep programs for foreign government [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  You're gonna have progressive people that want to keep all of those programs that all of the role of list [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=289.0s)]
*  But the common sense middle of the road [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  Democrat or Republican is gonna say and all the Republican Party is gonna say stop wasting our money. We're in debt [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=296.82s)]
*  We're giving money to these programs that we don't agree with to other countries. They don't need these programs [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=303.58s)]
*  Some of them yes, maybe and there's an argument for that if it's feeding children or if it's [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=309.3s)]
*  Preventing HIV from a child from getting HIV and they're allowing to send that drug over or the malaria drug [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=314.98s)]
*  I get it, but these programs [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=321.3s)]
*  It's so much waste and the Democrats what are they scared of are they scared to save money? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  Are they scared that we'll pull back the curtain and actually see what how progressive these Democrats really are [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=328.35999999999996s)]
*  They don't want this done and it just baffles most Americans. So here's Joe Rogan saying hey guys [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  This is what America voted for [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=339.4s)]
*  What's fascinating right now is we're getting a chance to see what happens when you take a business approach to the government the same [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=342.4s)]
*  People that say we need radical change. We need radical change. We've got corruption [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=348.91999999999996s)]
*  We need radical change. Okay. Well, here's your radical change. We don't need this but you do the government does they need oversight and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=352.76s)]
*  Haven't had that and because of that you're seeing this not just waste you could call it waste, but it's it's deeper [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=360.88s)]
*  It's deeper than waste. It's corruption and you're seeing that that corruption get weeded out [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=367.9s)]
*  Some of the people working for Elon Musk group Doge are in their 20s [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=374.92s)]
*  So what is wrong with 20 year olds? Have you talked to them in terms of being? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=378.8s)]
*  The Silicon Valley is populated by mostly 20 year olds 20 to 30 year olds. This is their generation. This is intuitive to them [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=382.76s)]
*  They're great at it and they help Elon Musk build seven major companies to make him the richest person in the world [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=389.12s)]
*  So they between 40 and 60,000 were 40 and 60 thousand [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=395.12s)]
*  Workers have applied for the six-month buyout [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  So they're examining whether we can do that or not bottom line is our federal structure is too big [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=401.88s)]
*  So in any company you have to pare it down when your number one expenditure is paying the debt on money you owe [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=407.74s)]
*  This has to be the focus [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=415.1s)]
*  But if you look at the left all they're doing is mocking Elon Musk one of the smartest richest people in the world and ripping [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=416.98s)]
*  20 year olds because they're examining the Treasury [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=423.18s)]
*  So I just I hope in the good the judges don't get in the way of this pairing down and slimming down to the government [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=426.22s)]
*  The executive branch has large discretion over these funds and when I look at all the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=433.42s)]
*  Crisis in America that we're currently experiencing we can go all the way back to Ohio East, Palestine [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=440.7s)]
*  Where their protests? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=446.82s)]
*  Advocating for those people have there's been protests in Los Angeles for the rebuild North Carolina [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=448.82s)]
*  Have we seen people assemble assemble to give those folks the funds that they need they have not [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=453.3s)]
*  And I think it's a slap in the face of the American people and one viewer came on the Martha show yesterday [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=458.91999999999996s)]
*  And I'm not saying this is true [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=464.76s)]
*  But the viewer said are they getting money like why are they so passionate for the average day American at home? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=466.28s)]
*  This is an independent voters. Just like why are they like this? Are they getting kickbacks or something? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=472.08s)]
*  They're so passionate about this money next up the NGOs. We're gonna do it. Oh, yeah, what's going on there? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=477.12s)]
*  We need that right? Okay, and Joe Rogan's right. It's corruption. It's more than waste [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  You [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7sBChvozI&t=488.84s)]
