# County supervisor criticizes sanctuary status of San Diego: ‘WE NEED TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES SAFE’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk)
*  What I heard from the incoming head of ICE is that we have the same desire to go after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=0.0s)]
*  those who are committing violent acts, repeated violent acts among innocent New Yorkers and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=11.92s)]
*  among migrants and asylum seekers. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=17.84s)]
*  We promised to put our two staffs together and work out the details, but as of yesterday, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=20.12s)]
*  he's all in. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=23.68s)]
*  Incoming borders are Tom Homan and New York City Mayor Eric Adams say they have the same [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=25.64s)]
*  goals. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=29.76s)]
*  Following their meeting this week on the migrant crisis, this is many Democratic run cities [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=30.76s)]
*  and states are looking to further protect migrants against deportations. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=35.08s)]
*  A move San Diego County and California made this week. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=39.96s)]
*  For more on that, let's bring in the man in the middle of that fight, the lone San Diego [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=43.96s)]
*  County supervisor to vote no on furthering sanctuary city policies, Jim Desmond. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Jim, when you messaged me much earlier this week that this was going to take place, I [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  was in disbelief because what it appears has happened is that not you, because the vote [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  was three to one, but the other San Diego County supervisors voted to protect the illegal [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=67.2s)]
*  criminal migrants from deportation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=73.48s)]
*  Is that the case? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=77.0s)]
*  Are they placing a priority on the interests of criminal migrants over public safety? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=78.0s)]
*  Well, what they're doing is they're putting in another bureaucratic layer hindering local [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=84.0s)]
*  law enforcement from being able to engage directly with ICE and let ICE know, hey, we've [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  got this criminal, this person in our jail that has committed a crime. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=94.32s)]
*  They've been tried. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  They're here in jail. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=99.78s)]
*  They're here illegally. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=100.96s)]
*  And we're letting, and right now we have had, I'm sorry, in the past, before this past, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  we had direct access to ICE. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=107.0s)]
*  We can pick them up, pick up the phone, give them a call, let them know, hey, this person's [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=108.72s)]
*  in our custody and or this person's about to be let out of jail. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  And so what my colleagues did is they put in another layer of bureaucracy that hinders [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=115.88s)]
*  law enforcement from directly working with ICE by making now the requirement is going [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=120.24s)]
*  to be that we get a federal or state warrant to be able to contact ICE before instead we [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  had that direct access. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=132.28s)]
*  Now we have to go through some judge who and who knows what this which way this judge is [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=133.48s)]
*  leaning. We need to clean up our streets. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  We need to keep our community safe. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=140.32s)]
*  And by this action, it makes us less safe and the bigger potential of these people just [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=141.92s)]
*  being let out onto our streets in San Diego County and making them less safe. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=146.32s)]
*  Jim, why would your colleagues do that? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=154.04s)]
*  You got to ask them. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=156.08s)]
*  They would just, you know, the reason some of the people that were, you know, for this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=157.44s)]
*  effort, they were saying, well, you're breaking up families, you know, and people will less [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=161.4s)]
*  be less likely to report crimes. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=166.2s)]
*  This is about people that are already in jail. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=168.88s)]
*  This in San Diego County, they're already in jail and they've already been tried and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=171.44s)]
*  committed for these crimes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=175.72s)]
*  This has got nothing to do with breaking up families. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=178.4s)]
*  The criminal should have thought about that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=180.72s)]
*  They're the ones breaking up families. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  So, you know, instead of blaming the criminal for the acts they're doing, you know, they're [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=184.56s)]
*  pointing the finger elsewhere. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=189.08s)]
*  And it's just really, you know, these people, if they do get out of jail and they go back [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=190.76s)]
*  into the communities, it's going to most likely be in the immigrant communities and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=195.72s)]
*  they're going to hurt them the most. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=199.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's the demographic that faces the greatest threat. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=201.28s)]
*  I want to play just a little bit more of New York City Mayor Eric Adams after his [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  meeting with Tom Homan, because he seems to get something that your fellow supervisors [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=210.2s)]
*  don't. Listen here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=215.72s)]
*  We're going to protect the rights of immigrants in the city that are hardworking, giving [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=218.52s)]
*  back to the city in a real way. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=225.36s)]
*  We're not going to be a safe haven for those who commit repeated violent crimes against [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=227.68s)]
*  innocent migrants, immigrants and longstanding New Yorkers. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=233.8s)]
*  So there's a element of common sense to that statement there from Mayor Adams, who, of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=238.0s)]
*  course, has to protect the rights of all of the people that he is in charge of governing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=243.96s)]
*  But why doesn't San Diego County understand that that line? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=248.72000000000003s)]
*  Well, the East Coast is getting it, but the West Coast is much slower coming along. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=254.0s)]
*  Even in the election, the rest of the country got it that people are fed up with the way [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=258.96s)]
*  the immigration status has been happening with the open borders. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=263.4s)]
*  Unfortunately, my colleagues, I think this is more in retaliation. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=267.36s)]
*  And our governor, even Newsom, wants to Trump-proof California. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=271.08s)]
*  And so my colleagues, all three of them Democrats have voted for this. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=276.88s)]
*  I think, you know, going along in that same effort and we're the doormat for the border [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=280.72s)]
*  here in San Diego County. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  We we've we've had over one hundred fifty five thousand people just drop them into our [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  streets. We have boats pulling up onto our beaches and dozens of people just jumping out [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  and running into our neighborhoods. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  We should be making our streets safer, not less safe. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=297.92s)]
*  I know it and have seen it close and personal, particularly in places like Hacamba, where [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=300.92s)]
*  you're getting people from all over the globe, from more than a hundred different [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=306.44s)]
*  countries. Let me just ask you lastly, because I think this is important, Jim, where is [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=310.52s)]
*  San Diego County's sheriff on this? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=315.08s)]
*  What is she saying? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=317.84s)]
*  Well, the sheriff thankfully has said she's not going to enforce this new policy [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=319.68s)]
*  by that was put forward by my colleagues. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=326.6s)]
*  However, there's already a group out there that is threatened to sue and see how this [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=329.24s)]
*  plays out. My supervisors could react. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=334.08s)]
*  My colleagues could retaliate with taking or withdrawing funds or money from the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=337.08s)]
*  sheriff. So this still has to be played out. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=341.76s)]
*  I'm glad this sheriff has stepped up and said no. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=344.12s)]
*  But legal action and other actions are yet to come. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=346.84s)]
*  Well, we will continue to follow it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=350.84s)]
*  And Jim, please give us any updates as it unfolds. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=352.52s)]
*  Jim Desmond, San Diego County Supervisor. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=356.08s)]
*  Jim, thank you. Have a great weekend. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNXbtNtlfhk&t=357.88s)]
