# Elon Musk gives his endorsement for Senate majority leader
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8)
*  So this morning, the Republicans are closer to holding the House majority. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=0.0s)]
*  And in the Senate, the battle to become the next GOP leader heats up. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=5.36s)]
*  President-elect Trump says whoever wants the job should back a Senate tool allowing him [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=8.94s)]
*  to bypass Congress and quickly get his administration in place. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=13.46s)]
*  Reconciled a recess appointment, I guess. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=18.34s)]
*  Our next guest backs this move, which quickly earned him the support from Elon Musk. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=20.34s)]
*  Senator Rick Scott joins us right now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=24.86s)]
*  So Senator, it's you against Senator Cornyn against Senator Thune. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=26.62s)]
*  Why are you the best choice? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=31.060000000000002s)]
*  Well, first, happy Veterans Day. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  I was very proud of my father, one of the 3,000 people that did all the combat jumps [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=36.1s)]
*  with the second airborne in the second world war. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  He told me the Germans, the Foxholes, the Futurbats. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=42.82s)]
*  So I joined the Navy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=44.94s)]
*  I'm very proud of the JD is the first Marine enlisted like I did enlisted in the Marines [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=45.94s)]
*  is the first first Marine vice president elect in the United States. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=52.06s)]
*  And I've got colleagues. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=57.1s)]
*  So so first I want to thank everybody for their service. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=58.1s)]
*  Thank God for people willing to put on the uniform with regard to the Trump nominees. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  We got to get them done. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=64.7s)]
*  Whatever whatever it takes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=65.7s)]
*  If it's a recess appointments, whatever it takes, we got to get these done. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=66.7s)]
*  We know Schumer is going to slow everything down. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=69.38s)]
*  I am all on board. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=71.42s)]
*  We're going to get we've got to change the direction of country. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=73.58s)]
*  The country voted. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  They want a change. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=77.42s)]
*  They want the Trump agenda. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=78.82000000000001s)]
*  They want his nominees. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=80.30000000000001s)]
*  They want his policies. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=82.54s)]
*  We've got to do everything we can to get that done. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=83.54s)]
*  So Senator, how is your chances looking because we're talking about a simple majority, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=85.7s)]
*  That you have to get. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=90.14s)]
*  It looks like you got Thune as well as my senator, John Cornyn from the great state [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=91.62s)]
*  of Texas, but they may split the vote. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=97.54s)]
*  So how's it looking for you right now? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=100.4s)]
*  I'm very optimistic. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=104.10000000000001s)]
*  I believe I'm going to win. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=105.10000000000001s)]
*  You know, Thune and Cornyn are friends. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  Here's what I bring to the table. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=109.62s)]
*  I clearly believe in the Trump agenda. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=111.14s)]
*  Number one, I'm a business guy that has success doing exactly what we need to do in the Senate. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=114.26s)]
*  We need to have a plan. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=120.58s)]
*  We need to work a plan. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=122.7s)]
*  We need to have a team. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=124.2s)]
*  We need to measure ourselves. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=125.42s)]
*  If we want to get all the nominees done, we've got to figure out a plan to get it done. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=126.42s)]
*  If we want to get a balanced budget, we got to start today to get a balanced budget. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=129.82s)]
*  If we want to get the border secure, if we want to get whatever policies we have to get [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=134.02s)]
*  through Congress, we have to have a plan just like what you do in business. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=138.45999999999998s)]
*  I ran a company with 285,000 employees. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=141.98s)]
*  We had a written plan for everything to get it done. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  My colleagues have told me they want change. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=148.14s)]
*  They want to be treated as equal. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=150.82s)]
*  They want to be part of a team. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=152.38s)]
*  They want to have an agenda. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=153.73999999999998s)]
*  They want to have a great relationship with the House. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=155.22s)]
*  They know I have a great relationship with Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  So I'm very optimistic that I'm going to win because I'm representing Trump's agenda and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=160.06s)]
*  what my colleagues want. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=166.14s)]
*  So you have Elon Musk in your corner. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=168.0s)]
*  You have Senator Marco Rubio in your corner, but it's a secret ballot. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=170.17999999999998s)]
*  Do you have Trump in your corner? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=173.54s)]
*  Well, I hope he weighs in. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=175.98s)]
*  I welcome his support, but that's up to him. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=180.06s)]
*  Tommy Tubbleville is supporting me. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=183.06s)]
*  Bill Haggerty is supporting me. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=184.98s)]
*  The Ron Johnson is supporting me. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=187.14s)]
*  There's other people that clearly would like what I'm talking about, but it's a secret [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=189.7s)]
*  ballot. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=195.3s)]
*  So we'll see if they come out publicly and support me. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=196.3s)]
*  But I'm going to work hard. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=198.26000000000002s)]
*  I believe I'm going to win because I represent exactly what the Trump team wants and what [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=199.94s)]
*  Trump wants and what the American public wants. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=204.66000000000003s)]
*  We have a great Republican Party across the country. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=207.3s)]
*  We need to have a Republican Party representing us as leader in the Senate. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=209.82000000000002s)]
*  So let's go to some other news because what's happening in PA, I think it's kind of disgraceful [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=214.9s)]
*  right now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  The race has been called by the AP, many publications. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=220.58s)]
*  You got your leader who is not going to allow him to go to the orientation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  And you got your colleague Senator Mike Lee saying that he will personally escort Dave [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=229.11999999999998s)]
*  McCormick into the Capitol for the orientation. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=233.0s)]
*  So what is your thought process on this? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, they did the same thing to me six years ago. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=239.56s)]
*  They didn't let me go through orientation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  So Schumer blocked it and our leader of the time didn't help. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=247.2s)]
*  So help me. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=254.76s)]
*  So it's the exact same thing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=256.52s)]
*  So Schumer is going to do everything he can to block the Trump agenda. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=259.12s)]
*  We have got to have a leader that's willing to stand up and say, no way, we are going [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  to do the right thing and we're going to stand up for our rights here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=270.08s)]
*  I mean, Dave McCormick won. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=274.56s)]
*  He won fair and square. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=276.66s)]
*  He got more votes than his opponent, Bob Casey. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=279.1s)]
*  He needs to be part of orientation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=282.38000000000005s)]
*  So I look forward to him coming up. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=284.70000000000005s)]
*  I look forward to hopefully seeing him today or tomorrow. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  And I'll do everything I can to help him become a successful senator. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=289.0s)]
*  All right, Senator, good luck with your vote on Wednesday, right? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=291.94000000000005s)]
*  So we'll see what's going to happen. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=295.02000000000004s)]
*  We'll get a majority leader. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=296.34000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=297.70000000000005s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=298.70000000000005s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKDIQFS-5o8&t=299.70000000000005s)]
