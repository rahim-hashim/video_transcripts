# 'POWER OF PROJECTION': Obama shredded for 'deeply bitter,' 'angry' post-election speech
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8)
*  One of the lessons I think we've come to understand, I hope that everyone has come to understand, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=0.0s)]
*  is the power of projection. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=4.8s)]
*  Accuse your opponent of the sins which you're committing. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=7.78s)]
*  President Obama gave us, former President Obama, gave us another example of projection. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=10.64s)]
*  Thursday night in Chicago, he gave a speech where he talked about the weaponization of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=15.92s)]
*  government and the polarization of your opponent, the polarization of America. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=21.38s)]
*  Let's listen to the words of former President Obama. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=27.2s)]
*  Since total victory is impossible and the country politically split down the middle, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=31.16s)]
*  the result is a doom loop of government gridlock, even greater polarization. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=35.44s)]
*  When I mentioned to a few friends that our foundation would be hosting a forum on democracy [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=42.56s)]
*  and pluralism, I got more than a few groans and eye rolls. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=49.64s)]
*  Especially since, as far as they were concerned, the election proved that democracy is pretty [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=56.4s)]
*  far down on people's priority list. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=62.68s)]
*  There are going to be times, potentially, when one side tries to stack the deck and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=65.44s)]
*  lock in a permanent grip on power, either by actively suppressing votes or politicizing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=70.4s)]
*  the armed forces or using the judiciary, the criminal justice system to go after opponents. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=85.72s)]
*  That my friends is projection. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  That is amazing, actually. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=95.16s)]
*  So it's intentional. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  I mean, this isn't just some tick or something that just popped into his head because he's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=97.83999999999999s)]
*  bummed out that they lost the election so bad. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=102.88s)]
*  People need to understand Barack Obama has been a really negative force on this country [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=106.56s)]
*  on politics and creating so much division. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=112.4s)]
*  That comes from Saul Alinsky. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=115.92s)]
*  People forget Barack Obama was teaching rules for radicals. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=117.56s)]
*  He was teaching about Saul Alinsky at the University of Chicago. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  That is a hero to him and one of his rules among many that was meant to basically dismantle [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=126.44000000000001s)]
*  society and bring about this liberal utopia. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=132.6s)]
*  One of them was how to attack your enemy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=137.06s)]
*  Saul Alinsky took his lessons from Lucifer, actually. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=139.8s)]
*  He talked about that being somebody who could teach them how to take power and control. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  Here is Barack Obama, Charlie, I think, really kind of going ... He's in a bad spot. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=150.44s)]
*  He created this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=156.28s)]
*  He thought it was going to become this permanent power base for him. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=157.4s)]
*  Now he's accusing the right of what he did because he's just super bummed out right now. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=161.8s)]
*  It is total projection. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=167.32s)]
*  It's also desperation. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  That's the thing that is so striking to me about that entire ... All those remarks that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=171.2s)]
*  he made, that entire speech or whatever it was. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=176.04s)]
*  The depth of the ... He's very bitter. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=179.72s)]
*  That's not the Barack Obama who ran, who gave that speech in 2004. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=182.64s)]
*  Even if you didn't agree with him and didn't like him and didn't agree with his policy [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=187.56s)]
*  prescriptions, it's a different guy than he was when he gave that speech in 2004 or when [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=190.32s)]
*  he won that election in 2008. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  He is a deeply bitter, angry guy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=198.16s)]
*  He's talking about how voters don't care about democracy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=201.64s)]
*  Open change has turned into dour and bitter. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=205.4s)]
*  Yeah, bitter and projectionism. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  I would say, and while he's projecting, he's not just projecting that which we all know [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  at this point, which is the Department of Justice was weaponized under Joe Biden. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=213.64s)]
*  There was a consolidation of permanent Washington under Joe Biden. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=217.24s)]
*  What we should also point out is it all began under Barack Obama. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=220.6s)]
*  That is when, for example, he spied on a Fox News reporter. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=224.48s)]
*  That is when Lois Lerner targeted conservatives with the IRS. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=228.24s)]
*  That is when much of this began and was just extrapolated under the presidency of Joe Biden. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=231.48s)]
*  Yeah, and then also under Barack Obama and then metastasized under Joe Biden, which many [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=237.24s)]
*  people believe that administration was being run out of Obama's mansion in Calorama, Washington, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=243.76s)]
*  DC. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=250.44s)]
*  That said, I mean, the censorship industrial complex that was used to also consolidate [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=252.12s)]
*  that power is something else. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=256.76s)]
*  And that's one of the things that people were really voting against, along with the weaponization [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=259.92s)]
*  of the government, this idea that it could be used to to censor us and therefore allow [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  them to consolidate power. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  Barack Obama is very isolated right now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=272.56s)]
*  Even his best friend, George Clooney, who wrote the op-ed that ended up pushing out [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=274.6s)]
*  Joe Biden, is now upset at Barack Obama going, hey, you told me to write that op-ed. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=279.76s)]
*  Now everyone's blaming me online. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=286.12s)]
*  Where are you, Barack Obama? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=288.48s)]
*  Barack Obama's becoming he's not used to not being glorified. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=290.48s)]
*  And this is an interesting moment for him. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=294.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=296.36s)]
*  And meanwhile, across the aisle, you have Donald Trump, who has taken over the mantle [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=297.36s)]
*  of sort of occupying the broad center of American public opinion on things like illegal immigration [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=300.44s)]
*  to the point where you even have New York City's mayor, Eric Adams, who has previously [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=308.12s)]
*  supported sanctuary cities. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=313.68s)]
*  So he can't be let off the hook entirely. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=315.32s)]
*  But he's open to the idea that Donald Trump and Republicans are might very well have some [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=317.38s)]
*  solutions to solve the grave problems in the city. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=323.02s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=326.0s)]
*  Would you ever consider rejoining the GOP? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  The party that's the most important for me is the American party. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm a part of the American party. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=335.08s)]
*  I love this country. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=336.68s)]
*  This is the home of the free, the land of the brave. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=338.2s)]
*  So Eric Adams there, who has taken the side, to your point, Charlie, of Donald Trump, or [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=340.68s)]
*  at least tilted in the direction of Donald Trump when it comes to illegal immigration, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=345.6s)]
*  there even leaving the door open to a return to the Republican Party. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=350.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's what the pills are coming due. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=353.92s)]
*  He's like, wait a minute, maybe this wasn't such a great idea. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=355.76s)]
*  But also don't forget, Mayor Eric Adams was the subject, I think, of the weaponization [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=358.6s)]
*  that we were just talking about. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=363.92s)]
*  You know, he, you said he was for sanctuary cities. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=365.62s)]
*  He saw the effects on his city. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=368.82s)]
*  He was listening to the feedback coming from the Bronx and Queens and people saying, this [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=370.76s)]
*  is horrible, our crime is up, we can't walk the streets. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=375.34s)]
*  You know, there's, you know, illegal businesses on the sidewalk. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=378.8s)]
*  The place looks like crap. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=382.0s)]
*  And so he started to respond to it and draw attention to what was happening at the border. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=384.02s)]
*  And all of a sudden, he had a big investigation on him. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=389.2s)]
*  And so Donald Trump famously at the Catholic event here in New York City just before the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=391.86s)]
*  election, sort of reaching out and saying, hey, I know what that feels like. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=396.90000000000003s)]
*  This government can be weaponized. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=401.74s)]
*  And I think that's why he's losing his thrill with the Democrat Party. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=403.62s)]
*  And again, it might just be, you know, that he's just being politically savvy, reading [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=409.3s)]
*  the tea leaves. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=413.7s)]
*  People are in no mood for Democrats and the radical agenda right now. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=414.74s)]
*  But I also think that he has experienced enough to know that this was not good for [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=418.76s)]
*  his city and also what happened to him personally. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  So it's a lot going on there. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YUP0exCt8&t=427.12s)]
