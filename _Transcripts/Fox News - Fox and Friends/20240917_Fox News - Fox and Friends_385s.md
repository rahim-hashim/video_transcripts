*  Good morning to all of you the indictment against Diddy will be unsealed this morning and that according to the US Attorney for the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=20.2s)]
*  Southern District of New York Homeland Security actually taking the lead on this case the charges against the embattled rap mogul not yet revealed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=25.56s)]
*  His attorney though telling the New York Times he believes Diddy is being charged with racketeering and sex trafficking [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=33.64s)]
*  Diddy's lawyer given a statement to Fox News digital saying quote [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=40.44s)]
*  We are disappointed with the decision to pursue what we believe is an unjust prosecution of mr [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=43.62s)]
*  By the US Attorney's office. He is an imperfect person, but he is not a criminal to his credit [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=50.24s)]
*  Mr. Combs has been nothing but cooperative with this investigation [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=55.440000000000005s)]
*  He looks forward to clearing his name in court that was homes in Los Angeles and Miami were raided back in March in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=58.78s)]
*  connection to a federal human trafficking investigation [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=65.64s)]
*  The rapper also has several sexual misconduct allegations against him all of which he has denied back over to you [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=68.6s)]
*  All right, Todd. Thank you very much. It's a long time coming [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=76.4s)]
*  I mean we've heard about this for longest time this case looks huge. They got the video footage from his house his mansions [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=79.32s)]
*  You got the the the accusations flying so and I guess he came to New York knowing this was gonna happen [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=85.72s)]
*  Yeah, let's bring in criminal defense attorney Lexi rigged in to talk about this Lexi last November his ex [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=91.44s)]
*  Her name is Cassie Ventura sued him for sexual assault rape domestic violence and sex trafficking the next day though that lawsuit was settled a few [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=97.16s)]
*  Others came out accusing him of different things as well [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=105.08s)]
*  And then last May that video surfaced of him with his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=108.12s)]
*  And I believe that was the video in the hotel right in front of the in front of the elevators [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=113.12s)]
*  Yeah, what do you think is gonna happen and what will we learn when the indictment is unsealed today? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=117.32s)]
*  Well, Ainsley we're gonna learn a lot more when the indictment is sealed as you know [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=122.0s)]
*  Especially what people really want to know is exactly what he's being charged with but to your point about all of the information that came [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=126.12s)]
*  Out of him. I mean this was a meteoric fall from grace. I mean this was he was an impresario [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  He was involved in the hip-hop community [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=138.04s)]
*  He became obviously very wealthy and he knew that this was coming down the pipe [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  First of all, the lawsuits started hitting then his houses started getting raided and now he's selling off his shares of various businesses [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=144.72s)]
*  His very expensive mansion in California is up for sale [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=152.16s)]
*  So he's clearly been preparing for this and did come to New York with the understanding that he was going to be arrested [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=155.68s)]
*  Which I can't even imagine how he must have felt about that sitting in that hotel room in New York [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=162.4s)]
*  But today we're gonna be able to find out exactly what he's charged with which I think will be [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=167.84s)]
*  racketeering just like his attorney said racketeering potentially violations of the man act which is [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=173.12s)]
*  Transferring somebody across state lines for illegal sexual activity and those are reminiscent of what R [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=178.88s)]
*  Kelly was charged and ultimately convicted with so [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  This this is kind of similar to what happened in the past with him [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=186.83999999999997s)]
*  So Lexi, this is not the first time they've tried to go after diddy [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  But what ends up happening is that the witnesses suddenly go away. Does that mean that it is different this time? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=193.76s)]
*  I mean we had a three house raid yet [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=200.92s)]
*  Florida yet New York and you had [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=204.16s)]
*  California so does this mean that this time that the Fed finally has cooperation from witnesses? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=206.92s)]
*  I think it is different this time. First of all [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  I think that the the civil cases which were explosive with the allegations really brought to focus his behavior [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=216.0s)]
*  And then one of those lawsuits by a former mail assistant [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  Actually has a lot of pictures and a lot of video that was referenced in the lawsuit [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=226.55999999999997s)]
*  And so not only do I think they have obviously witnesses who are cooperating [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=231.77999999999997s)]
*  But they also have evidence to support these charges [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=236.27999999999997s)]
*  That was a very detailed and and disturbing and surprising lawsuit that was filed by his former mail assistant [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and and Ainsley was talking a moment ago like see about [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=245.5s)]
*  Cassie his longtime girlfriend. She sued him [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=250.34s)]
*  He settled the next day then five more women five more people came out of the woodwork and also sued him [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=253.26s)]
*  But they decided not to settle they decided they were going to fight it in court [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=259.5s)]
*  And then you come upon these home raids and it wasn't the local cops it wasn't the FBI it was Homeland Security [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=263.8s)]
*  Investigations that a lot of people have never even heard of but they're the ones who investigate sex trafficking cases [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  That's a unique unit and that's why they essentially came out with bazookas [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=278.64s)]
*  Right, and and these are federal crimes. Obviously the man act is a federal crime [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=283.68s)]
*  And then the sex trafficking and there could also be potential for a lot of those lawsuits [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  Referenced rampant drug use and weapons one of Cassie's allegations was that he forced her to hold a gun in her purse [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=293.48s)]
*  I mean so there there could be also [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  Potentially a narcotics and firearm aspect to this as well. All right, what about Homeland Security? Why are they leading this case? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=303.32s)]
*  Homeland Security isn't is usually in charge federally of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=311.16s)]
*  Investigating human human and sex trafficking cases [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=314.94s)]
*  So that that's that's just standard operating procedure for why they were there [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=317.88s)]
*  But it just shows how seriously this has been taken after those lawsuits brought to light and I think had they not been filed [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=322.38s)]
*  There wouldn't have been the media attention [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=329.5s)]
*  and there wouldn't have been the substance for the feds to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=331.62s)]
*  Take a look under the hood and say gee, there's something seriously wrong with this guy [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=335.58000000000004s)]
*  And this isn't his first brush with the law and he was acquitted in 1999 of a nightclub shooting [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=339.20000000000005s)]
*  And which involved JLo which was a very sensational story. So [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=344.88000000000005s)]
*  You know, he's in a world of trouble, right? But he's got a lot of money. He's got a lot of lawyers. We'll see what happens [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=349.12s)]
*  Lexi, thanks so much. He likes see his lawyer said he's disappointed daddy's a music icon [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  Diddy is a music icon loving family a philanthropist adoring his children imperfect, but he is not a criminal [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=359.86s)]
*  Please reserve your judgment until you have all the facts. He's an innocent man with nothing to hide [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=365.88s)]
*  All right. We'll see we'll see if his sons are involved too because they were all over this thing. I certainly in the video [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qqG9TSZyFg&t=370.12s)]
