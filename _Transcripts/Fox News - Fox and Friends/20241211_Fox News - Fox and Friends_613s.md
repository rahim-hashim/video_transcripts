# Daniel Penny surprises hosts with answer on whether he regrets helping New Yorkers
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU)
*  Marine veteran and New York City subway hero Daniel Penny is speaking out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=0.0s)]
*  speaking out for the first time after he was acquitted this week in the subway [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  chokehold case. Penny opened up about his experience in an exclusive interview [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=8.72s)]
*  with our own judge Jeanine Pirro. The full interview with Daniel Penny is [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=14.22s)]
*  available on Fox Nation. That's right so one day after being acquitted he sat [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=18.14s)]
*  down at a location looks like an office probably one of his attorney's offices [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=23.68s)]
*  overlooking lower Manhattan and you know yesterday on the program we were [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=29.2s)]
*  talking about how he was exonerated how he was acquitted and we we wondered [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=34.48s)]
*  given the fact that he has been to hell and back ten times since he was charged [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=39.24s)]
*  with the death of Jordan Neely would he do it again if he were riding the subway [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=44.44s)]
*  today would he do it again? Here is the surprising answer. Will you take the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  subway again? Yeah and I have been. I believe in New York I love New York. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=58.24s)]
*  Knowing what you know now Danny if you faced the same situation again would you [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  do it again? Yeah totally I would not be able to live with myself if I didn't do [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=70.68s)]
*  anything in that situation and someone got hurt I would feel guilty for the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=78.56s)]
*  rest of my life and I think I'm in a position and all people if they're in a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=83.84s)]
*  position to help should always help. I think that's the New York thing to do [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=92.2s)]
*  it's the American thing to do and yeah I would. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=96.4s)]
*  That's why he did it in the first place. So he said that he believes that all [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=103.12s)]
*  people should help I mean that's how we all feel is that especially if [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=107.88s)]
*  you're a man you don't watch women and children one lady had a baby being [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=111.44s)]
*  harassed and don't do anything about it and what there's such a there's such a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=117.92s)]
*  void right now the cops can't do their job anymore you know the DA is a lot of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=123.36s)]
*  criminals just take take us under siege in this city it's like Gotham City in in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=128.16s)]
*  New York right now and so it's only up to us to stand in I still even though he [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=133.56s)]
*  got off and the jury's put a red line in I think more people are gonna be [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=139.12s)]
*  hesitant to get involved now Rachel. Yeah that's the problem right I mean we want [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=145.0s)]
*  good Samaritans we want heroes to step forward especially young strong men like [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=149.44s)]
*  this with the kind of experience he has from the military to step in and do the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=153.56s)]
*  right thing and I do think people will be hesitant and part of it is because you [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=157.76s)]
*  know when it first happened people were hailing him as a hero initially because [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=163.8s)]
*  we have to remember what was going on at that time people were dying on the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=167.38s)]
*  subway there were people getting shoved into the tracks and then this guy comes [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=170.38s)]
*  in and does that and then right away as soon as he starts getting that hero [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  adulation the forces of the racial justice cottage industry starts you know [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=178.9s)]
*  doing their thing and trying to turn him into a villain this young man actually [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=185.06s)]
*  talked to Judge Neen by the way this kid has good judgment also picking Judge Neen [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=189.3s)]
*  this was she did this interview beautifully she was the right person to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=193.02s)]
*  do this I was getting even better than Barbara Walter vibes off this Judge [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=197.70000000000002s)]
*  Neen killed it in this interview she was amazing and here he is talking to her [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=201.82000000000002s)]
*  about what it was like to go from hero to villain because of the racial justice [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=206.62s)]
*  industry listen. You go from a hero to a villain when they say they're going to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  indict you. Right. How do you feel about that? You know obviously it's it's pretty [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=221.16s)]
*  nerve-racking it's it was yeah it was very anxiety inducing but throughout [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  this whole process I would remind myself of the witnesses coming up to thank me [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  and really no matter what outcome the trial had I only cared about what the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  witnesses what the witnesses said about the situation and I only cared about [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=249.28s)]
*  their opinions. I'm on you know immediately when this happened I got a [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=253.84s)]
*  text message and said I surf with this guy I've been surfing with him for two [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=258.64s)]
*  and two and a half years he's one of the greatest guys they go is there anything [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=262.84s)]
*  in his background that's gonna come up as we were trying to make sense of this [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=265.64s)]
*  goes zero and then you find out they went all over his back and tried to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=268.32s)]
*  fight anything he did you know walked across traffic anything worked against [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=272.4s)]
*  traffic and he was actually in the military okay was actually in the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=276.08s)]
*  military for a while excuse me a military file he also was in the symphony [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=280.84s)]
*  so when he has some time he wants to be an architect and he was going to the gym [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=285.12s)]
*  so he's not even I mean there was nothing about him there was did anything [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=289.76s)]
*  but correct but here's what I worry about I worry about the civil trial yeah [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=293.56s)]
*  and with the threshold being so low and they're saying you know the cause of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  death and we remember that this could cost millions of dollars and I just [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  thank the American people for allowing his legal bills to be paid because he's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=305.08s)]
*  not from a family they could write a big check to be bankrupt and number two I [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=308.32s)]
*  worry about the civil trial because that'll send the wrong message too it's [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=312.15999999999997s)]

*  showing up now for the payout that's amazing well it's just unfortunate [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=349.76s)]
*  because he had a rough life I sympathize with his Jordan Neely with [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=354.64s)]
*  his story but that is not society's fault and it's not the innocent people [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=361.08s)]
*  that were on the subway's fault there was a system for that that system [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  clearly failed but you don't get to create some person to be the person that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  you crucify as a result of that go after the system say he didn't get homeless [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=378.59999999999997s)]

*  that was the hero suddenly this villain the last thing I say about this this is [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=387.35999999999996s)]
*  a story also about the leads I've been watching other networks talk about this [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=392.08s)]
*  you have the luxury not to have to take public transportation there's a lot of [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=396.52s)]
*  people that have to take the separate they have to take the bus I mean we're [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  blessed enough to be paid where you know if we want to take a black car we can [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=406.44s)]
*  take a black car okay average day New Yorkers cannot do that they can't afford [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=410.4s)]
*  an uber especially with all the surge price and that's why AOC's comments [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=415.76s)]
*  about this were so I actually found them kind of shocking because she is for all [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=419.71999999999997s)]
*  her flaws she's a populist after Trump won she went on social media and was [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=424.52s)]
*  like hey I really want to understand what happened here some people voted for [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=429.08s)]
*  Trump some people and at the same time voted for me she seemed curious and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  wanting to be in touch with everyday people but then these comments have [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  resurfaced of what she said at this time and her instincts were so wrong [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=439.56s)]
*  she's not with the common people who have to take the subway well we're all [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=443.44s)]
*  regarding Danny Penny taking the subway and he just said that he takes the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=446.84s)]
*  subway all the time and he will again I'm sure he's gonna take it today the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=450.92s)]
*  thing about Danny Penny though is he's got a distinctive look I mean if if you [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=454.96s)]
*  you would spot that hair a mile off I bet he wears he probably wears a [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=458.88s)]
*  stocking cap he probably wears a hat I saw photos of him out with his [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=463.16s)]
*  girlfriend right recently in one of these magazines and he's wearing a hat [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=466.48s)]

*  been fully exonerated by by a jury of his peers and that's why sit next to me [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=486.24s)]
*  clear what AOC said AOC said the subways are less safe because of people like [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=492.0s)]
*  Jordan Neely and it's for someone who grew up in New York you should know [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=498.48s)]
*  better and I will say this the whole interview you got to watch it because [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=503.88s)]
*  judge handles it because she lets she gets out of the way she asked the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=507.6s)]
*  question yes she lets him go and when a guy has long pauses my old instinct is [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=510.88s)]
*  to jump in she lets no she let it goes and the number two is Lawrence I'll [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x17DugcYOiU&t=515.34s)]
