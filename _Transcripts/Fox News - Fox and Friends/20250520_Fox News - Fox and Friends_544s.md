# 'Is anybody working there?!': Hosts react to NoLa jailbreak after fourth escapee captured
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y)
*  All right, welcome to Fox News Alert, Louisiana State Police capturing the fourth of the 10 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=0.0s)]
*  inmates who broke out of a New Orleans jail earlier Friday morning. The attempted murder [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=5.12s)]
*  suspect reportedly found inside an abandoned house. And as the manhunt for six others continues, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=9.92s)]
*  the DA says some of his staff and his family members are in hiding. Yeah, who wouldn't? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=15.92s)]
*  Nate Foy is live in New Orleans with the latest. Nate, you see anybody running around? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=21.84s)]
*  Haven't seen anybody running around quite yet, but yeah, it's five day five of this search and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=25.84s)]
*  every single day that nobody is hurt from any of these fugitives is a blessing because these are [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=32.8s)]
*  dangerous men charged with murder, aggravated assault and domestic battery. So we know, as you [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=37.84s)]
*  mentioned, progress is being made with an arrest last night, but still six of the 10 fugitives [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=44.16s)]
*  remain on the loose. Take a look at Gary Price. He is the most recent fugitive to be arrested. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=49.36s)]
*  Actually, the first one to be taken into custody since the first 24 hours of this search. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=55.6s)]
*  Price is charged with first degree murder. He was being held without bond awaiting his trial and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=62.64s)]
*  he'll now be taken to a state facility outside of New Orleans. As I mentioned, he's the first one [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=67.92s)]
*  arrested since Friday. Take a look at the map where the other three were found. All pretty close [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=72.8s)]
*  proximity within New Orleans and a source close to the investigation tells me that authorities [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  believe the remaining inmates are also still in the city and that's not good news for the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=83.2s)]
*  people who prosecuted their cases. I am personally afraid, not just for myself, but for my lawyers [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  who tried the case against the individual twice. We were asking for a life sentence of this man [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=98.16s)]
*  and he is now at large. Two of the lawyers who I tried that case with, who successfully [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=105.28s)]
*  went forward, able to get a conviction on that case, these lawyers got out of town this weekend [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=113.52s)]
*  with their families. Yeah, so people who prosecuted cases leaving town, also the family members and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  friends of former victims also leaving town concerned with what these fugitives might do. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Take a look at this. So the 10 guys broke out of the jail using a hole in the wall behind a toilet. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=132.96s)]
*  You can see right above that hole, they taunted officers writing, quote, too easy, LOL. They then [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=138.16s)]
*  ran off from a loading dock area and crossed the highway. The Orleans Parish Sheriff said it's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=144.8s)]
*  believed the inmates received help from someone inside the jail. Three jail employees are suspended [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=150.48s)]
*  pending an investigation. Now, Louisiana State Police are warning friends and family of these [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=156.64s)]
*  fugitives that if they assist them and help them evade law enforcement, that they too will be held [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=163.36s)]
*  responsible. A source close to the investigation tells me they believe that they're getting good [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  information, that they have good intelligence on these fugitives, but so far for the remaining six, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  the timing has been off. So we made it seem that they've come close to arresting the six remaining [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  fugitives. It just hasn't happened yet. You know, it's so amazing, Nate, is they found out that they [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=187.12s)]
*  left at one in the morning when they got up the next day. They found that they weren't there. They [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=192.48s)]
*  looked back at the tape and they said, well, at one o'clock they got out, but they didn't know until [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  eight hours later. And they looked at the tape. The question is, does anyone at the jail look at [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=201.6s)]
*  the surveillance cameras in real time? So normally they do, Brian, and the person who was supposed to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=206.16s)]
*  be doing that took a break to eat some food. So that was the first major security lapse here. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=214.72s)]
*  Also, these inmates, some of the most dangerous inmates in this facility, were on the first floor. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=221.44s)]
*  They're supposed to be held up on higher floors. Prior to that, there was a request from this [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=227.28s)]
*  facility to fix some doors that apparently you can knock the door off the track. And that is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  what the inmates did to get into that cell where they were able to dig that hole behind the toilet, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=239.52s)]
*  which ultimately facilitated their escape. So there are multiple layers of security failures [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=245.6s)]
*  that ultimately led to this escape. And now the priority is making sure that they catch the six [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=252.24s)]
*  remaining fugitives who are still out there. It's unbelievable. Right. Thank you so much, Nate. Also, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=258.08s)]
*  it is law in that area that you have to notify the media within minutes of knowing there have [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=263.2s)]
*  been inmates that have escaped. And they didn't do that. It took them hours to alert the media. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=269.76s)]
*  Was it the district attorney, the one who said he's afraid, the DA, Jason Williams, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=274.88s)]
*  said he learned about it on the media, through the media. They didn't notify the DA. They didn't [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=278.48s)]
*  even notify the victims as well. And it's like, is anybody working there? He had to do that. Exactly. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=282.32s)]
*  Why are they in that type of prison? It's a minimum. Exactly. They should be in the state [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=286.72s)]
*  prison. Number two, are y'all not doing sweeps? Did you not? I mean, it takes a while. Seven to eight [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=291.92s)]
*  hours. To be able to get that off the hinges there. Y'all didn't check that. And it's probably made a [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  lot of noise. When they're pulling that door, that had to be making a lot of noise. And why do you [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=302.88s)]
*  have people in a prison where the doors can be knocked off the hinges, where anybody can get [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=306.0s)]
*  inside of the door? So if other inmates want to let other people out, they can do that as well. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=312.64s)]
*  It's just stupid. That's where I was this weekend, in New Orleans. Oh, that's right, Brian. So I saw, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=317.68s)]
*  and by the way, two of them, this video, in the French Quarter. Right. They're in the French Quarter [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=322.8s)]
*  on Saturday. You know, so they know the clubs and bars to go to. And they stuck around. So [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=327.04s)]
*  they're smart enough to get out, but they're not smart enough to stay out. I mean, why would you, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=333.04s)]
*  if you were a criminal, why would you stay in New Orleans? And yet they stayed in town. Well, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=337.6s)]
*  he's trying to avoid the camera. I've done a lot of reporting in New Orleans. And they have this [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=343.44000000000005s)]
*  surveillance program where, because the crime has been, it was almost a murder capital, I think, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=349.04s)]
*  two years ago. And so all the local businesses installed these cameras that the police now have [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  access to. So he's trying to avoid these cameras. But I mean, think about the brazenness. You're in [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  the French Quarter, the most populated area right there, all the tourist attractions. Graduation [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=364.79999999999995s)]
*  weekend. And you think it's just okay. So the first three were found in a parking lot in the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=370.0s)]
*  French Quarter. The other two on the street. Police transported those three out of New Orleans [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=374.79999999999995s)]
*  on a secured helicopter flight on Saturday. Then they took them to a secure state correctional [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=379.28s)]
*  facility. Fourth guy, who Nate was just telling us about, Gary C. Price, will ultimately be [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=383.76s)]
*  transferred to a secure state facility outside of the area. Police say there's a task force there [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=388.64s)]
*  now of more than 200 law enforcement from local up to the national level. They're working around [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=393.68s)]
*  the clock, they say, to help locate the remaining ones. So you got some folks that sit out there, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=399.36s)]
*  as Ainsley noted. Derek Groves, he's convicted of multiple murders, connection with the killing of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  two people during the Mardi Gras in 2018. He's awaiting sentencing on a manslaughter charge [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=407.84s)]
*  since October 2024. Linton Van Bergen, arrested in 2021 for a second degree murder and armed [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=414.56s)]
*  robbery. You got Leo Taye sentenced to federal court for felony possession of a firearm, burglary [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=423.12s)]
*  theft, murder vehicle. So these aren't, you know, some upstanding citizens here. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=429.84s)]
*  Serious violent criminals. Right. I mean, the cops are underpaid, they're understaffed. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=434.24s)]
*  As far as I know, they're not led by anyone competent. And then it looks like the mayor is [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=439.2s)]
*  just overrun with corruption down there. That's right. Nonstop, evidently alleged as some type [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  of affair with a member of law enforcement. But let's listen to what the governor, Jeff Landry, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=450.16s)]
*  had to say yesterday. He's as outraged as you were. I think if you look at the criminal justice system [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=455.52s)]
*  as a whole in New Orleans, you will see the problem. Several years ago, George Soros came [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=462.0s)]
*  over to New Orleans like Santa Claus and unpacked the district attorney, six judges, and a sheriff. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=467.84s)]
*  And this is what criminal, this is what progressive criminal justice system looks like, Sandra. This [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=473.2s)]
*  is what happens when those people promise that they keep criminals out of jail. Sadly, you get [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=479.6s)]
*  10 of the most dangerous inmates that are in jail in Louisiana, they get to escape. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=485.76s)]
*  I mean, he's so right. He used to be a cop. He understands the problem better than anyone. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=492.56s)]
*  And, you know, I said it just a couple of years ago, it used to be the murder capital world. And [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  the DA still didn't do anything. The mayor still didn't do anything. That's why a lot of us, when [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  the, you know, the terrorist attack happened in New Orleans, it was the prime location because they [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=506.48s)]
*  had demonized the cops and they weren't enforcing the laws of the police. Remember those roadblocks [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=511.12s)]
*  were in their possession and they didn't use them? Well, the system has clearly failed. You have the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=515.76s)]
*  soft on crime policies. You have George Soros pouring money into the area. The locks don't work. It's [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=520.4s)]
*  a continuous failure of the system. And now the people who are scared are the ones that locked [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=526.4s)]
*  these criminals up and the victims and their families and they're in hiding. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=530.72s)]
*  And most compelling analysis. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PV0pcbi1Y&t=541.12s)]
