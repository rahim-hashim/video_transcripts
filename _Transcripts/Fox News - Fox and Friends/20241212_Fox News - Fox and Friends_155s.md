# Pentagon denies mysterious drones are sourced from Iran 'mothership'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg)
*  New Jersey lawmakers ripping the Department of Homeland Security leaving a briefing with no answers on the source of the mysterious drone [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=0.0s)]
*  Lighting up the state skies this has the Pentagon is denying claims [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=7.08s)]
*  They were sent by foreign enemies here to react retired Army General Anthony Tata [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=11.72s)]
*  General you you know this space very well [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=16.48s)]
*  And when I hear the Defense Department denying denying about while still allowing the drones to fly [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=19.36s)]
*  I just feel like the feds know something they don't want us to know what's your take on well [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=25.36s)]
*  I think there's that and there's just sort of a lack of concern you think of the loss of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=30.68s)]
*  Trust faith and confidence in the FBI the DOD [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=35.32s)]
*  Homeland security the Intel community think of all the misses the Intel communities had from [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=39.36s)]
*  Afghanistan Taliban to Russia Ukraine to Israel and so what are they missing here? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=45.4s)]
*  What are they not telling us and and the good news is Lawrence that you know President Trump has picked [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=50.88s)]
*  You know Pete heads out to come into DOD and Governor Noem into DHS cash in this way [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=56.56s)]
*  I also gathered into the Intel community great picks that are going to restore trust faith and confidence in the way that these [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  Agencies operate and focus on the missions that they're supposed to do instead of all this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=70.48s)]
*  Extraneous stuff because the people don't know what to believe right now. You've got congressmen [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=75.2s)]
*  You know getting in fights with the DHS you've got the commander of Picatinny Arsenal where we manufacture [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=80.36s)]
*  And do research on ammunition we store ammunition there 12 confirmed sightings [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  18 possible sightings you got Maguire Air Force Base [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=94.08s)]
*  Which is the strategic power projection base that that also has sightings down there [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=97.64s)]
*  And so what's going on and where are these things coming from? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=102.5s)]
*  They could be coming from a ship that's parked off the coast or in Harbor that it could be coming out of a container [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  And and it could be a merchant ship [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't have to be a warship or a mother ship [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  You know it could just be a couple of containers full of drones and the rest are Barbie dolls [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  And and we need to think creatively and we need to understand what the Intel community knows what the FBI knows [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  Because I don't think that right now DHS or DOD are really focused on anything [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=130.88s)]
*  And they don't feel like they need the answer to us as well general [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=136.4s)]
*  Hopefully that's gonna change in about a month or so. Thank you general. Thank you large [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjsgiI3nKIg&t=139.68s)]
