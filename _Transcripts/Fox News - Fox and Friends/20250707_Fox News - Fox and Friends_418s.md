# Kristi Noem mourns 'devastating' loss of life in Texas flooding
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w)
*  Kirk County, Texas devastated and 82 people dead after the state's catastrophic flooding. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump signing a major disaster declaration for the county yesterday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=6.0s)]
*  This as DHS Secretary Noem says the flood exposes a neglected weather alert system. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=10.88s)]
*  Let's bring in the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Madam Secretary, can you give us a little lay of the land right here? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=24.32s)]
*  What do you see that the folks here on the ground need, what resources, and what can we learn from this tragedy? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=28.72s)]
*  Well, this is a horrific situation, Lawrence. I mean, you're seeing it firsthand today. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=36.24s)]
*  I was there on Saturday and spent my time with the governor and the emergency management responders [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=41.76s)]
*  and a lot of the families that have been impacted, some of the parents of those kiddos at Camp Mystic as well. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=46.8s)]
*  It was absolutely devastating. So we responded immediately as soon as a request came in with Coast Guard assets. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=51.84s)]
*  With Customs and Border Protection assets that were specially trained for these kind of rescue missions. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=59.36s)]
*  Also FEMA has been activated and at an enhanced level. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=64.16s)]
*  So, you know, the partnership between the federal government and the state and those local officials is very tight and working hard to make sure that we're bringing some relief to these families and finding people and reuniting people with victims of this flood as soon as possible. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=68.0s)]
*  But it is, make no mistake, how tragic this situation is. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=83.2s)]
*  And the president is fully engaged and willing to do all that he can to help the people of Texas through this because it is a national situation that everybody's hearts are just broken over. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  It really is. Madam Secretary, you had on over the weekend said that there were some reforms needed for the emergency notification system. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=97.44s)]
*  Can you be more specific about what those upgrades need to be? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=107.76s)]
*  Well, when I got there on Saturday, you know, one of the number one questions we had asked was, you know, we were notified, but we only had a couple hours of notice before this flash flood came. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  You know, was the National Weather Service proactive? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=123.12s)]
*  You know, what was the process that was followed? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=125.76s)]
*  And the National Weather Service did send out notifications, gave as much time as they could with the tools that they have. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=128.88s)]
*  And we actually had staff on the ground that was more than would have been in the past because of the holiday vacation. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  But frankly, the National Weather Service under President Trump has been working to put in new technology in a new system because it's been neglected for years. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=142.16s)]
*  It's an ancient system that needed to be upgraded. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=149.2s)]
*  And so President Trump recognized that right away and got to work on it when he came into office in January. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=151.76s)]
*  But that installation is not complete and that technology isn't fully installed. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=157.2s)]
*  But the alerts went out. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=161.44s)]
*  We can continue to learn from every single situation, but know that during these times when we are trying to help people heal from situations like this, the best thing to do is to look and see how we can help and how we can walk along people and get them some relief. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=163.28s)]
*  Make sure that we're doing all that we can to be more proactive in the future, but get through this terrible time right now as well. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=179.36s)]
*  Sure. But was there any specific breakdown in this particular case that we should know about? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=185.04s)]
*  You know, not that we've found so far. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=191.68s)]
*  The National Weather Service put out the alerts when they received them. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=194.32s)]
*  And unfortunately, in many places in our country, we have flash floods like this that do occur. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=198.68s)]
*  And the notification was proactive and out there. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=203.68s)]
*  Would everybody like more time? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=206.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=207.8s)]
*  You know, in so many situations when we see terrible events like this and these natural weather disasters, more notification is always extremely helpful. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  This situation was especially tragic because of the location, because of the holiday weekend, because of these kids in these camps that were impacted along the Guadalupe River. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=218.6s)]
*  And the loss of life is just devastating. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=230.16s)]
*  We know the numbers are continuing to rise and and we have been prepared for that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=232.52s)]
*  But for those families that are sitting there waiting for word, their hearts are just broken, absolutely broken. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=237.32s)]
*  Madam Secretary, you stood next to the president as he talked about dismantling FEMA in favor of greater autonomy and targeted resources under the control of state and local officials. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=243.12s)]
*  Does this tragic situation underscore that need for you or does that change that dynamic of what would work best moving forward? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  I think what we've seen here is exactly what President Trump has envisioned for FEMA is immediately allowing the state to do the response and supporting them in every way that they can. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  So this response was driven by Governor Abbott and his emergency management director and the local officials that were on the ground. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=271.6s)]
*  And we were immediately there with to fill in the gaps where they needed and to give them their disaster declaration as soon as possible, which happened almost immediately as soon as the governor asked. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=278.96s)]
*  That's the FEMA and how it should operate rather than than how it operated under the Biden administration and previous administrations where it was slow to respond, slow to get resources there. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=289.2s)]
*  We already have emergency response teams on the ground that have been there from the very beginning. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=299.04s)]
*  And then we want to empower the states to do the response that's necessary to best serve their people. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=304.44s)]
*  So, you know, the FEMA that President Trump wants in place is one that takes care of people, but also empowers those people who live in those communities that know how best to respond to have the authority to do so. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=308.96s)]
*  Yeah, real quickly, Madam Secretary, I still can't get over the 45 minutes. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=323.12s)]
*  I mean, from alert 45 minutes to respond to the high level of water. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=328.56s)]
*  I mean, I have one of your swimmers on we had on Fox and Friends for the Coast Guard and he said he didn't feel safe getting that water. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=333.47999999999996s)]
*  So how can we expect, you know, kids to respond in 45 minutes? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=340.44s)]
*  Yeah, I can't get over it either, Lawrence. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=346.52s)]
*  I mean, I really can't wrap my head around it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  The alerts went out several hours in advance, but the rise in the level of water and how quickly that happened just really was unprecedented for this area, how quickly it happened in that alert and what those individuals had to do to get to safety and what those counselors and camp directors tried to do to get those girls to safety. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=350.4s)]
*  It was absolutely unbelievable hugging those parents on Saturday as they were looking for their children. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=371.12s)]
*  I talked to one father who found the one of the best friends of his daughter while he was still looking for his daughter, hugged one of the grandpas who was looking for his granddaughter. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=376.48s)]
*  Yesterday, Franklin Graham and I had a call in a prayer and shared some scriptures with families at a church that were still waiting to find their loved ones and spent some time visiting with them and talking to them about this difficult situation. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=386.12s)]
*  It really is unbelievable, the tragedy that we are seeing and my hope and prayer is that we can find these people with their family members as soon as possible. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=399.96000000000004s)]
*  We join you, Secretary, in those prayers mightily. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=411.04s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=413.44s)]
*  Thank you, Madam Secretary. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVVhRsCxB1w&t=416.32s)]
