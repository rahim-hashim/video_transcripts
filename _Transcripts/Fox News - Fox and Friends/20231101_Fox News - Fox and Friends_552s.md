# Netanyahu adviser's chilling message to Hamas leaders: 'We will find you'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY)
*  Let's bring in Mark Rigev, senior advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=0.0s)]
*  He's live from Jerusalem. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=4.44s)]
*  Mark, good afternoon to you there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=5.86s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=8.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=9.74s)]
*  It is good news that they have opened the Ra'afah crossing. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=10.74s)]
*  I know that this was a negotiation between the United States, Israel, Hamas, and Egypt. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=13.5s)]
*  Is it just going to be 400 or 500 today? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Is that going to be it? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=22.0s)]
*  I can't give you the answer because we want everyone to leave who wants to leave. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=24.0s)]
*  The question is what will Hamas do? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=28.5s)]
*  When Secretary Blinken was here on his first visit, that's over two weeks ago, we discussed [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=30.6s)]
*  our willingness to work with the Americans to get all your American citizens out. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=34.82s)]
*  That was our commitment. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=39.58s)]
*  And I thought it should have been done when we made that decision. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=41.1s)]
*  But Hamas was holding the American citizens as sort of hostages. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=44.38s)]
*  They didn't want to let them leave. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=48.56s)]
*  Apparently, they've agreed finally to let them leave. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=49.82s)]
*  I hope they can all get out and return home and be with their families. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  So Hamas is telling the mediators that it will release the hostages soon. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=56.42s)]
*  This was said in a video yesterday on the Telegram app. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=60.64s)]
*  What's the latest? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  So we don't believe much of what Hamas is saying publicly. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=66.42s)]
*  They say something and they say the opposite the next day and you never know what is true. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=71.02s)]
*  And the assumption is that everything they say is just psychological propaganda for their [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=75.26s)]
*  terror machine. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=79.7s)]
*  I can say the following. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=81.02000000000001s)]
*  We're continuing to hit the Hamas terror machine hard. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=82.7s)]
*  They're facing our blows. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=86.26s)]
*  They're feeling our might. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=88.14s)]
*  And I think that pressure will do more than anything else to get our hostages out. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=89.76s)]
*  Together with the diplomatic pressure on Hamas' allies in the Gulf, I think that's the way [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=94.5s)]
*  to get our people out. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, Ambassador, you're right. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=100.94s)]
*  They are feeling it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=103.10000000000001s)]
*  But my concern is the propaganda war. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=104.66000000000001s)]
*  It looks like Hamas is winning it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=106.5s)]
*  And I worry that the US as well as the UN already hates you guys already and they've displayed [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=109.26s)]
*  that over the years. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=114.6s)]
*  But I worry that it's going to cause pressure from the US and American journalists that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=116.28s)]
*  you guys won't be able to do the full war effort for long. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=120.44s)]
*  Do you worry about that? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=124.72s)]
*  You know, you talk about the propaganda from the other side and the trouble is, and sometimes [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=127.28s)]
*  I think parts of your colleagues in the media are guilty of this, people don't understand. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=132.66s)]
*  Hamas is not a democracy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=137.16s)]
*  No. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=138.88s)]
*  Gaza is a brutal authoritarian regime there. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=139.88s)]
*  And people who speak to the media, whether they're doctors or nurses or some local official, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=143.6s)]
*  they have to follow the party line. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=148.5s)]
*  They have to follow Hamas' line. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=150.6s)]
*  And so all the information coming out of Gaza is controlled by Hamas. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  The pictures you see are controlled by Hamas. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  The words that come out of Gaza are controlled by Hamas. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=158.76s)]
*  And as a result, people get a very warped picture. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, have you seen a single picture of a dead Hamas terrorist since we started operation [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=164.12s)]
*  inside Gaza? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=169.72s)]
*  No, they don't allow pictures. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=170.72s)]
*  They only want you to believe that innocent civilians have been hit. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=171.84s)]
*  Well, obviously we've been hitting Hamas terrorists one after the other. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  So the Houthi rebels declared war on you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=180.2s)]
*  They're hitting you with some long-range rockets. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=182.04s)]
*  I know you're not shy about bombing the terrorists in Syria. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=184.56s)]
*  You've hit back at the Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  Were you hit back in Yemen? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=192.84s)]
*  First of all, if we're about to do anything, I can't share it on television for obvious [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=196.28s)]
*  reasons. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  But all I can say is a statement that you know is true and I know is true, that is anyone [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=200.48s)]
*  who attacks Israel will face Israeli retribution, will face responsibility. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  You shoot missiles into Israel, we will hit back. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=210.88s)]
*  Great. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=214.83999999999997s)]
*  Ambassador. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=215.83999999999997s)]
*  That's a yes. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=216.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=217.83999999999997s)]
*  If Hamas is eradicated, as Israel would like to see and many people around the world would, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=218.83999999999997s)]
*  what happens next? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=223.88s)]
*  Who's waiting in the wings? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=224.88s)]
*  So first of all, can I just rephrase your question and say when Hamas is eradicated [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=227.68s)]
*  because we are determined. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=231.52s)]
*  We will do this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  We're talking about what happens after there is no longer a Hamas-controlled Gaza. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  A terrorist group. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=238.56s)]
*  Yeah, a brutal terrorist group responsible for the most hideous violence. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=239.56s)]
*  You've seen the pictures, I've seen the pictures. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=244.68s)]
*  These people are the enemies of everyone who believes in humanity. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=247.10000000000002s)]
*  These people are, as President Biden said, sheer evil. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=250.26000000000002s)]
*  Now what happens when they're gone? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=254.96s)]
*  We've been talking with the United States about different scenarios. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=258.56s)]
*  I'm not going to go into too much detail. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=261.78000000000003s)]
*  All I can assure you is that like when ISIS was defeated in Syria and Iraq, better things [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=263.46s)]
*  came after ISIS. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=269.7s)]
*  I am convinced that once Hamas is gone, once they no longer have their terror enclave in [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=270.86s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, I'm sure what comes after will be preferable, both for Israelis, who [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=275.94s)]
*  won't have to live in fear of these brutal terror attacks that we've suffered, and for [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=281.58s)]
*  the Gazans who deserve something better than this terror regime that doesn't give a hoot [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=285.97999999999996s)]
*  about them. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=290.14s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=291.14s)]
*  Ambassador, before you go, Tray Yanks was just talking about how Israeli missiles struck [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=292.14s)]
*  a refugee camp, the Jabalah refugee camp. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=299.46s)]
*  Apparently you were targeting a Hamas big shot, and there were other big shots in Hamas [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=304.73999999999995s)]
*  there as well. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=311.17999999999995s)]
*  Is that the new dimension, rather than hiding in a hospital, they're hiding with people [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=312.66s)]
*  who are trying to escape for their lives? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=317.74s)]
*  So first of all, the Jabalah refugee camp, a lot of people have moved to the south, the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=320.94s)]
*  vast majority of people. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=324.82s)]
*  And I noticed in the pictures that we just saw in your report, the people around the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=326.68s)]
*  crater where our strike had happened were mostly young men of military age. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=330.9s)]
*  And it didn't look like a lot of innocent civilians to me, but what I can tell you is [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=336.1s)]
*  if you are part of the Hamas leadership, if you are part of the command structure that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=341.1s)]
*  was responsible for the rapes, the murders, the beheadings, the mass shootings, the massacres [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=345.66s)]
*  that they perpetrated in Israel, we will find you and we will take you out. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=353.54s)]
*  We'll do so in a way, we'll try to be as surgical as we can to avoid other people getting caught [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=358.66s)]
*  up in the crossfire. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=363.3s)]
*  That's our commitment as a democratic country. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  But if you are responsible for Hamas atrocities, we will find you and we will take you out. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=366.66s)]
*  How many are there? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=373.06s)]
*  There's enough, there's still a few more on the list and the senior leadership, they have [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=375.18s)]
*  to care, they have to worry about us too. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  Israel will find you, we will reach you, we will take you out. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=380.86s)]
*  But Ambassador, I'm sorry, some of the criticism is that you guys knew about their positioning [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=384.02000000000004s)]
*  before, but y'all didn't strike them. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=390.34000000000003s)]
*  And I'm hearing this from IDF guys that I've known for a long time, that y'all knew about [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=392.8s)]
*  the position, so why strike now? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=396.58s)]
*  Why not be preventative? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=399.85999999999996s)]
*  And I know that's a conversation for after y'all take out Hamas, but y'all knew these [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=401.3s)]
*  targets before. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=406.26s)]
*  So first of all, there was a strategy to try to deter Hamas from attacking, which obviously [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=410.09999999999997s)]
*  failed. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=414.94s)]
*  And we have to have our own investigations in Israel of why we were surprised on October [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=416.02s)]
*  7th, why we paid such a heavy price in blood. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=421.58s)]
*  We have to have lessons learned because we always prided ourselves on having really good [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=425.7s)]
*  intelligence and that we were taken by surprise like we were, that's unacceptable. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=429.58s)]
*  We have to do a better job, that's clear. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=434.44s)]
*  But if you ask about Israeli preemption, we could only preempt if we had specific information [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=437.02s)]
*  and unfortunately, we didn't have the specific information and we paid for that in blood. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=441.3s)]
*  We have to get our act together and I think you're seeing now the Israeli people united [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=446.14s)]
*  as never before, understanding that we have to deal with this threat. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=449.86s)]
*  And what's the bottom line? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=453.78s)]
*  The bottom line is we refuse, we refuse to live next to this enclave of terror on our [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=455.26s)]
*  border. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=461.53999999999996s)]
*  That enclave will be destroyed. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=462.53999999999996s)]
*  That's good for Israel. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=464.3s)]
*  That's good for the civilians of Gaza. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=465.62s)]
*  We will end Hamas's regime of terror in the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=467.4s)]
*  Is there a difference between the Palestinians and Hamas in your view? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=470.86s)]
*  Should we separate the two? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=474.12s)]
*  Listen, they're in Gaza. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=475.86s)]
*  There are literally hundreds of thousands of children. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=478.5s)]
*  We don't want to see anything happen to them. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=481.38s)]
*  We are making our maximum effort. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=484.02s)]
*  We are targeting Hamas and its military machine. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=485.94s)]
*  When you talked about the refugee camp, it's not Israel firing on this huge tinted camp, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=489.46s)]
*  right? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=494.46s)]
*  They're concrete buildings and houses in this neighborhood in Gaza. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=495.46s)]
*  That's 100% correct. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=500.18s)]
*  And you have to ask why they're refugees because they're living in their own country. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=501.5s)]
*  Why does the UN still classify them as refugees when they're living in their own homeland? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=504.5s)]
*  But that's a separate issue. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=509.44s)]
*  What happened, those pictures you see, is we targeted the terrorist and we got him and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=510.88s)]
*  he deserved to meet his fate. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=515.84s)]
*  And because it was an underground tunnel network, that caused the surrounding buildings to collapse. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=518.12s)]
*  And this is how Hamas works. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=524.68s)]
*  They build their military infrastructure under civilian neighborhoods. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=526.0s)]
*  I've said before, and it needs to be said again, in normal countries like the United [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=529.92s)]
*  States, like Israel, our military is to defend our people, to protect our civilians. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=534.2s)]
*  Hamas inverts that in a perverted way. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=539.44s)]
*  For them, their civilians protect their military. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=542.1600000000001s)]
*  It's disgusting, it's an outrage, and it has to be condemned. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=545.5200000000001s)]
*  Alright. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=548.2800000000001s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you very much for joining us live from Jerusalem. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdl5_RxZrY&t=549.2800000000001s)]
