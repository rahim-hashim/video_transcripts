# Center of economic universe is 'running through Mar-a-Lago right now': Jenkins
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0)
*  So we got some news to get to after a whole week of drama on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=0.0s)]
*  The House and the Senate finally got it together and passed the third version [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=5.36s)]
*  of the funding bill, keeping the lights on in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=10.36s)]
*  So what is in this funding deal that passed last night? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=13.44s)]
*  And I was going to the president for him to sign it today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=16.52s)]
*  It funds the government through March 14th, 2025. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=18.8s)]
*  It also includes roughly one hundred billion dollars in disaster relief [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=21.96s)]
*  and also includes a foreign bill extension. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=26.28s)]
*  What it does not include is the debt ceiling suspension [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=29.0s)]
*  that President-elect Trump was hoping for. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=32.4s)]
*  And there were reports last night that the president-elect is really steamed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=34.52s)]
*  The debt limit did not either get extended or canceled altogether [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=39.68s)]
*  because they would rather the transition put something out the other day. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=44.36s)]
*  Increasing the debt ceiling, not great, but we would rather do it on Biden's watch. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  It's going to be a lot easier for him to do things like extend the tax cuts [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=52.2s)]
*  when he gets in if the Democrats are not, as Elizabeth Warren would say, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=55.0s)]
*  hostage taking over the debt limit. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=59.28s)]
*  But Elizabeth Warren is with Trump on this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=61.52s)]
*  It could happen. It could happen. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=64.32s)]
*  It could indeed. But what's so significant about this past week is you and I [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=66.64s)]
*  were covering the Mar-a-Lago Trump transition all week long, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=70.88s)]
*  was that we were clearly headed for an easy passage of that first version [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=74.64s)]
*  of the continuing resolution. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  And then you saw first Elon Musk weighing in saying, hang on. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=81.28s)]
*  This thing is huge. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=85.0s)]
*  And then President-elect Trump fully weighed in saying, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=85.91999999999999s)]
*  this is not why I got elected. This is not what America's want. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=88.96s)]
*  They don't want these, as Trump says, Democrat giveaways in this 1500 plus bill. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=92.88s)]
*  And now you've gotten exactly what was should have been the first option, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=98.16s)]
*  which is a skinny bill. Just get us to March. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=103.96s)]
*  And then obviously he wanted the debt ceiling and you didn't get it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  You've got members of Congress, though, like Andy Harris, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=109.83999999999999s)]
*  conservative, weighing in on exactly putting into perspective what happened. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=113.6s)]
*  Here's some of what he said. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=117.16s)]
*  Yeah, he posted this on X. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  Since President Trump's historic election to bring down spending, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=119.72s)]
*  deficits and inflation, the, quote, Republican-led house was, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=124.36s)]
*  and it has initiated 300 billion dollars in unpaid for new spending [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=128.88s)]
*  without even attempting offsets to prevent skyrocketing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=133.48s)]
*  The deficit and debt future generations deserve better. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  I am now undecided on what house leadership should look like. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=139.6s)]
*  And the 119th Congress just want to get the numbers out there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=143.2s)]
*  11 Senate Republicans and 34 house Republicans voted no. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=146.56s)]
*  Democrats by and large were all in favor of supporting this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=151.12s)]
*  And to his point about how now these house Republicans won't commit to what [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=153.72s)]
*  the leadership should be next time. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=157.84s)]
*  Mike Johnson did the thing that Kevin McCarthy did. They got him ousted. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=159.56s)]
*  He pushed forward a spending bill with democratic votes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=163.76s)]
*  That could be a fatal flaw. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=167.48s)]
*  And I know that this is something it happens every Christmas, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=169.76s)]
*  except like one in the last 15 years. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=173.0s)]
*  But there is a reason that this is different. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=175.32s)]
*  The president elect the incoming president is negotiating spending bills [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=177.4s)]
*  and then making the current president sign them. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  It's, it's so true. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=184.4s)]
*  And where has president Biden been throughout all of this? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=185.6s)]
*  I was thinking yesterday that he was going to be up late at night because this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=187.88s)]
*  passed in the house at five 30, that it was going to go over to the Senate. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=191.24s)]
*  They would have it for several hours and that he was going to have to sign it [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=193.76s)]
*  into law right after it passed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=196.8s)]
*  But then the white house released a statement that he'll, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  he'll get to it in the morning. Are you kidding me? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  And I think Harris's last point there about what house leadership looks like [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  while we're talking about this and the country feels like, oh great, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=207.56s)]
*  we're not going to have a shutdown on January 3rd. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  As soon as the house comes back after the new year, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=212.8s)]
*  the first thing they're going to deal with is whether or not to reelect Mike [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=215.56s)]
*  Johnson as speaker again. And there's obviously some unhappy folks. However, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  in the last hour we had Congressman Carlos Jimenez from Florida saying to your [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=224.0s)]
*  question, Peter, that speaker Johnson is the right man for the job. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=228.56s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=231.72s)]
*  I'm going to be supporting Mike Johnson. Look, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=233.56s)]
*  these are the cards that are dealt. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=236.0s)]
*  If we had sufficient Republicans to pass some bills, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  we wouldn't need any Democrats. Unfortunately, we, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=243.8s)]
*  we can't seem to agree with each other. We had like 30, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=246.92s)]
*  30 Republicans that did not vote for this, for this bill. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=249.96s)]
*  We only have like a two or three seat majority. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  And so when you, when that happens and you have to get something done, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=255.16s)]
*  and then all of a sudden you got to look over, oh gee whiz, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=258.88s)]
*  we have to pick up some Democrat votes. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=261.52s)]
*  Then the final bill isn't what we would like because we have to actually pick up [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=263.28s)]
*  some Democrat votes. And so it actually works against us. And so, yeah, I don't, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=267.88s)]
*  look, I don't think so. These are the cards that are dealt. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=271.84s)]
*  What we've learned from ousting Kevin McCarthy was that though he was playing [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=274.44s)]
*  those cards about as well as anybody could and speaker Johnson's playing those [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=279.64s)]
*  cards about as well as anybody can. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And being the house speaker is just one of the hardest jobs on Capitol [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=285.24s)]
*  Hill. And even after the vote passed out of the house, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=288.56s)]
*  he was interviewed and he said that he spoke to the president elect and he spoke [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=291.08s)]
*  to Elon Musk and they're both pleased with the passing of this [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=295.36s)]
*  bill. And he joked that when he's talked to Elon Musk, he's like, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  do you want to be speaker? You know, just, just a joke being like this, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=304.84s)]
*  this stuff is hard. As we have learned over the last few weeks, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=307.6s)]
*  Mike Johnson, it doesn't matter what anybody says. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=312.08s)]
*  Mike Johnson is one truth social social post away from it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=314.16s)]
*  And it's so true. Yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=318.68s)]
*  Republicans have a majority of just four seats when the next congressional term [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=320.16s)]
*  starts to 19 to two 15 and two Republicans, uh, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=325.2s)]
*  congressmen Paul Gosar and Thomas Massey have already said that they won't back [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=329.48s)]
*  him. I mean, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=333.76s)]
*  we remember what the vote count looked like when Kevin McCarthy was going [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=334.44s)]
*  through this, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=337.52s)]
*  where you have all the numbers on the side of the screen and you just watch and, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=337.96s)]
*  and see who's going to vote how and what the fate of the speaker of the house [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=342.0s)]
*  will be. That's what we're going to go through again in January. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=345.4s)]
*  Then, you know, Mike Johnson's getting a lot of criticism right now, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=348.52s)]
*  but he was just doing his job. I mean, his job, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=352.4s)]
*  he's got a huge body in Congress with everybody having different wants and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=355.44s)]
*  needs and he's got to wrangle it all with a very slim majority. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  So if Republicans wanted farm aid and they wanted some disaster relief, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=363.16s)]
*  he's going to have to cut a deal with Democrats. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  And he was just trying to get it all through and it ballooned in size, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=369.6s)]
*  but they got it down and they got it passed. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=372.44s)]
*  But we're not done hearing the last of president like Trump's frustration [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=374.92s)]
*  with working with the Democrats because remember his initial criticism was we, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=379.88s)]
*  we're not going to negotiate with the Democrats. We're going to do it our way. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=385.72s)]
*  And there's no doubt that Washington is now Trump's town. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=389.08000000000004s)]
*  And that's what speaker Johnson's going to have to deal with. He just impacted. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  And what, what, what, you know, the other thing that's so fascinating, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=396.32s)]
*  cause I keep saying this, but Peter and I were covering the transition this week. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=399.68s)]
*  When I was in Mar-a-Lago all week, literally the CEO of TikTok, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=403.40000000000003s)]
*  Jeff Bezos before that you had Zuckerberg, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=407.8s)]
*  all of Silicon Valley's most powerful. Look, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=411.04s)]
*  the center of the economic universe no longer runs through wall street or [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=413.64000000000004s)]
*  Silicon Valley. It's running through Mar-a-Lago right now. And any, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=417.12s)]
*  uh, better example of how that's painting out, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=422.04s)]
*  look at the donations to the inaugural committee. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=424.4s)]
*  A lot of it coming from people like Zuckerberg that are cutting the million [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=428.4s)]
*  dollar checks. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=432.24s)]
*  A lot of these rich guys that are going down to Palm beach are writing big [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=433.16s)]
*  checks for the inauguration. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=436.24s)]
*  So far $200 million for this January 20th event. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=437.6s)]
*  They're on track for 225. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=442.36s)]
*  They are already at a record beating Trump's first one, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=444.03999999999996s)]
*  which was 107 million Biden 62 million. That was a COVID year. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=447.71999999999997s)]
*  And did you say this number? The, uh, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=452.52s)]
*  the Trump people think that the number will increase to 225 million. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=454.23999999999995s)]
*  The target was 150 million. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=458.28s)]
*  What this money is used for is essentially what they call inaugural events. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=460.88s)]
*  But I think that these donations are just, uh, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=465.15999999999997s)]
*  it's a sign of people saying we are excited about the incoming [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=468.35999999999996s)]
*  president. We have hope for the future. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=473.12s)]
*  And there's a new Fox's poll that shows that 55% of people say that they are [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=475.32s)]
*  hopeful for the country's future today, as opposed to 45 who say, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  no, that number was 53% said yes. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=484.72s)]
*  During the around the midterm elections right after the midterm elections in [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=488.12s)]
*  2022 and 43% said that they had hope for the future a year into [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=492.04s)]
*  Joe Biden's term. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=497.12s)]
*  And you look, this is how you get Trump after a year almost of Biden, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=497.96s)]
*  43%. Uh, it's up 12 points now with Trump coming back in. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=502.32s)]
*  Yeah. Look at that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=506.76s)]
*  64% of people say that 2024 was a bad year for the country. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=507.4s)]
*  And then you've got the, yeah, a bad year for their family. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=513.52s)]
*  40% said it was a good year. 50% half the country thinks that this was a bad year. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=516.48s)]
*  And you know, if you could go back to that original graph, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=520.92s)]
*  I hate to upset the producers, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=523.96s)]
*  but really you saw from December 2021 to now, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=525.6s)]
*  the numbers are literally flipped. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=529.76s)]
*  When you talk about a direction of a country and how the country feels, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=532.52s)]
*  you can see a literal flip in the opinions. 43 yes, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=536.04s)]
*  54 no, and 21, 55, 45 now that, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=540.72s)]
*  that's a significant shift. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=545.76s)]
*  Yeah. And it's just, it's just so clear. I mean, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=547.4399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't just win the electoral college. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=550.04s)]
*  He also won the popular vote. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=551.92s)]
*  And we were talking to people all across the country after the election. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  You just felt it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=556.6800000000001s)]
*  And he received votes from people who had never voted Republican before, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=557.5600000000001s)]
*  because he was talking about what he called on the campaign trail, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=561.2s)]
*  common sense issues when it comes to the economy, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=564.24s)]
*  when it comes to the border crime education, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=566.44s)]
*  it's such a stark contrast to the threats to democracy on the other side and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=569.44s)]
*  all the cultural social things that have really passed when people, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=575.6400000000001s)]
*  about what people care about now. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=580.8800000000001s)]
*  So people say that they're hopeful for the next four years and it's, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=582.4399999999999s)]
*  it's evident in the polling and also the donations that Trump is getting as [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=586.9599999999999s)]
*  well. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=590.0799999999999s)]
*  And there was something really interesting to your point. The two Trump, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=590.92s)]
*  two of the Trump campaign managers just did an interview with Politico. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=594.28s)]
*  They ran one third fewer issue based at digital or TV ads than the Harris people [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=597.52s)]
*  ran. So the, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=603.68s)]
*  what we are coming to see now is that the Harris people just never figured out [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=605.36s)]
*  what the point was. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=608.72s)]
*  Right. Exactly. And according to the latest Wall Street Journal reporting, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=609.92s)]
*  Joe Biden in office for four years was struggling the entire time and was very [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=615.2s)]
*  much sheltered by the staffers who were trying to do basically be the president. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=620.88s)]
*  And the reporters that were trying to talk to him. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwTaX5pgX-0&t=625.88s)]
