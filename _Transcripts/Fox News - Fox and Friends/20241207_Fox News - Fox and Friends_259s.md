# Trump returns to global spotlight in France: A ‘diplomatic balancing act’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE)
*  Today, Donald Trump set to return to the world stage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=0.0s)]
*  in his first trip abroad as president-elect. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=2.36s)]
*  He'll be at today's reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=5.76s)]
*  and is expected to have high-profile meetings, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=8.84s)]
*  including with French President Emmanuel Macron [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=11.02s)]
*  and Prince William. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=13.76s)]
*  Global politics expert and director of research [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=15.0s)]
*  and outreach at the American Ideas Institute, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=17.3s)]
*  Dr. Samantha Meitra joins us now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=20.86s)]
*  Doctor, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=23.78s)]
*  This is- [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Good morning, Bill. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  This is President-elect Trump's first meeting [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=27.060000000000002s)]
*  on the world stage, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=29.36s)]
*  but not his first meeting with world leaders. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=30.16s)]
*  We saw, for example, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=32.7s)]
*  come down to Mar-a-Lago to meet Donald Trump. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=35.86s)]
*  We've heard about the phone calls [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=38.28s)]
*  between the Mexican president and Donald Trump. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  Do you expect these interactions in Europe [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=42.16s)]
*  to be somewhat similar to what's already happened [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=45.1s)]
*  with Trudeau? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=49.96s)]
*  I think Europe has always been an interesting place [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  for Trump. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=54.16s)]
*  Do you remember when he went in Poland in 2017, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=55.0s)]
*  he gave that speech where he said that, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=57.28s)]
*  European civilization, we write symphonies, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  we are Christendom, and this is the society [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=61.44s)]
*  that created everything in science and history. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=64.64s)]
*  So this is a very carefully chosen place for him to go. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  It is a massive signaling operation, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=71.8s)]
*  as we say in international relations. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=74.08s)]
*  First of all, Notre Dame's reopening [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  is a big thing in Europe. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  It's a place where the international gathering is happening, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=79.88s)]
*  you know, the European leaders are there, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=83.52s)]
*  but it's also a very good diplomatic balancing act. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=85.16s)]
*  On one hand, he's there in Europe [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=88.0s)]
*  to talk with European leaders [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=90.16s)]
*  because Europe is jittery about Trump's coming, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=91.64s)]
*  and they don't really know how Trump is going [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=94.96s)]
*  to position himself when it comes to tariff, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=96.52s)]
*  when it comes to defense, when it comes to NATO. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=98.32s)]
*  So it's kind of like a reassurance in a way [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=100.28s)]
*  to the European leaders in large. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=102.4s)]
*  But also, this is a reassurance to the European right, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=105.12s)]
*  who are, you know, you see the elections in Romania, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=108.44s)]
*  like the right one, and then the elections went unnoticed. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=111.84s)]
*  So this is kind of like Trump's presence in Europe itself [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  proves to the European right, like, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  look, I can come back, there is a place for you [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=118.16s)]
*  in democracy, in European democracy, and have faith. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  So I think this is a very good balancing act [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=123.8s)]
*  that he's chosen this place to go. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=125.6s)]
*  What about the balancing act of serious negotiations, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=126.84s)]
*  serious diplomacy versus honoring the reopening of Notre Dame? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  What I'm curious about is we'll see if he has any meetings [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=133.88s)]
*  with Zelensky from Ukraine. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=136.08s)]
*  But there's also the questions of commitment to NATO [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=138.52s)]
*  and that type of interaction. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=141.44s)]
*  He's got all these guys there, Macron, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=144.24s)]
*  perhaps Zelensky. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=146.32s)]
*  Do you think there are moments here that help establish [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  the footing of the relationship going forward in Europe? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=150.88s)]
*  I absolutely think so. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=154.52s)]
*  I think the key is to see in the next few days [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=155.64s)]
*  what Trump does and what Trump says. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=158.6s)]
*  For example, with Zelensky, Zelensky understands [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=161.64s)]
*  that there is a writing on the wall, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=164.32s)]
*  that the war is technically unwinnable [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=165.56s)]
*  without the United States, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=167.56s)]
*  and how to start a negotiated end [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=168.64s)]
*  is something that he wants to position himself to. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=171.28s)]
*  Now, he wants to say that, you know, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=173.16s)]
*  if you keep giving us more weapons and money, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=174.76s)]
*  we can win the war. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=176.88s)]
*  But obviously, Ukraine's main problem is manpower, right? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=177.72s)]
*  America is not providing soldiers to Ukraine [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=180.48s)]
*  to fight Russians. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=182.56s)]
*  So that is something, you know, he doesn't understand. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  Or if he does, like he doesn't want to say in front of Trump, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=185.48s)]
*  but Trump does understand that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=187.84s)]
*  And on the other hand, with the Europeans, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  like Trump's fundamental instinct [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  is to make Europeans pay more for their defense. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=192.28s)]
*  Now, that is a start of a negotiation. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=194.56s)]
*  There are ways to think about how to end this war in Ukraine. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=196.72s)]
*  There are ways like it could go like the North [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=199.12s)]
*  and South Korean armistice thing, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=200.56s)]
*  where you just stop firing at each other [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=202.12s)]
*  and kind of like have a demilitarized zone. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=203.56s)]
*  Or it could be like the Balkan Wars, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=205.12s)]
*  where you have like a main negotiation starting first, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=206.4s)]
*  and then you can find and figure out like what you want to be, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=208.44s)]
*  where you want to place yourself. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=210.88s)]
*  But fundamentally, this is Trump's way of finding out, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=212.4s)]
*  talking to other European leaders, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=215.0s)]
*  like, look, this is our position. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=216.4s)]
*  The war is unwinnable. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=218.96s)]
*  We have to have a negotiated settlement that I've been, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=220.24s)]
*  you know, I want to be a peace president, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=222.2s)]
*  and this is my legacy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=224.04s)]
*  So this is a time to start talking. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=225.84s)]
*  And I think this is a good ground for that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=227.56s)]
*  Yeah, and I think based upon the precedent [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=230.32s)]
*  of the meeting with Justin Trudeau, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  resetting relationships, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=233.76s)]
*  different from the way it's been the last four years, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=235.11999999999998s)]
*  one that focuses on America and takes, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=237.2s)]
*  because of that, a true leadership position. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=239.0s)]
*  That's pretty exciting about what could begin here [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=241.6s)]
*  today in France. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  Dr. Samantha Matre, thanks so much for being with us. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XH32XZzOxE&t=244.79999999999998s)]
