# WATCH: Thousands gather for Pope Francis’ funeral mass
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s)
*  mentioned earlier today, the first 300 years of the papacy, all of those popes were martyred. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=0.0s)]
*  So it has been a, you know, difficult, dangerous path. So as a Catholic, I look at it and I feel [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=6.24s)]
*  inspiration in the fact that it has such longevity. And when you talk about, you know, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  this pope is your favorite and that pope is someone else's favorite, obviously these people [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=22.72s)]
*  reach Catholics and people outside the Catholic faith in their own way. But the thing about this, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=27.84s)]
*  the Catholic Church is that it's not about any individual. It's not about any charismatic [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=35.6s)]
*  priest, although we love them and we love it when people can, you know, reach us that way, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=42.4s)]
*  but it's about the word and it's about the gospel. So no matter what is happening, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=46.4s)]
*  that is what has driven the faith for thousands of years. And it is an extraordinary story of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=52.32s)]
*  longevity. And as I said earlier, the longest surviving institution in history. So it's pretty [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=59.76s)]
*  remarkable. Yeah, it's an unbroken chain of popes. I mean, it's the first pope was Saint Peter. And [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=66.24s)]
*  that's why we see Saint Peter holding, you know, if you see images of Saint Peter, he's holding the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=73.6s)]
*  keys. You know, when you look at any statue, if they're holding the keys, oh, that's Saint Peter. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=78.48s)]
*  And as you pointed out earlier, the conclave means with key, which I did not. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  So, Martha, you've been there for a couple of days and, you know, there are tens of, many tens [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=89.92s)]
*  of thousands of people who have come from all over the world, you know, and just regular people. And [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=94.64s)]
*  watching, I love the images of all the people that line the streets and that were around, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=100.56s)]
*  you know, watching the funeral, participating in the funeral. Are these people who were visiting [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=106.48s)]
*  anyway, or were these people who, you know, he died on Monday, early Monday morning, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=112.4s)]
*  U.S. time, and just said, you know what, I'm going to spend, you know, thousands of dollars. I'm going [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=119.84s)]
*  to do whatever I have to do to get there, to go to Rome, to go to see the funeral. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  I think it's a combination, Charlie. But one of the things that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=131.6s)]
*  Pope Francis did was that he made this year, 2025, every 25 years, is a holy year jubilee. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=137.04s)]
*  So he invited everyone to come to Rome this year and to walk through these sacred ports, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=143.84s)]
*  the holy doors of the four major basilicas, invited everyone to come to Rome to do that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=151.44s)]
*  And so I think there are a lot of people who were here for that reason. I think a lot of people came [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=158.56s)]
*  over Easter. It's extraordinary, you know, just over the last few days, because [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  Easter Sunday was not even a week ago, and he was out in the middle of St. Peter's Square. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  And he said to the person who was helping to take care of him, Strapatti, who was by his side [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=174.72000000000003s)]
*  in all of these final months, he said, thank you for taking me back to the square. And [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  he wondered if he could do it physically that day. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=187.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=190.72s)]
*  And he went back to the people. His doctor had said, you know, we'd like you to take a couple of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=191.2s)]
*  months off and recover. And he said, no, I want to get out with the people. It's Easter. It's [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=195.28s)]
*  Holy Week. He went to a prison and saw 70 prisoners on Holy Thursday night. It was a tradition of his [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=200.96s)]
*  to wash the feet of the prisoners on Holy Thursday night. He wasn't able to physically do that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=207.68s)]
*  during this Holy Week. But this is just a few days ago. And now we have this extraordinary [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=213.12s)]
*  watching this funeral and the burial services that's underway right now. So to answer your [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=219.6s)]
*  question, Charlie, a lot of people are here because it's a Holy Year. And they happen to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=223.44s)]
*  have been here during an extraordinary moment that we've all been able to watch unfold. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=227.28s)]
*  Yeah. Such a reminder of our mortality. I mean, he was saying the Mass, participating in the Mass [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  less than a week ago. And here we are at his funeral Mass. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  And Martha, there was we've seen this image of President Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=242.08s)]
*  the president of Ukraine meeting. Do you have any other information about how long it lasted? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=247.12s)]
*  Anything, any readout from the White House yet on what was discussed or what might have been [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=253.52s)]
*  perhaps solved? Well, it seems it was a fairly brief meeting, but I think it's very interesting [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=257.76s)]
*  that of all of the people that he could have spent time with here in the short time that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=262.8s)]
*  they had this morning, it was Zelensky that he met with. And we know that they have worked [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=267.2s)]
*  on a ceasefire, that the president was hopeful when he was campaigning, that he could wrap this [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=272.56s)]
*  up very quickly if he could make some kind of arrangement between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=277.44s)]
*  But what we've seen over the past several days is that Russia has has not been playing ball. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=280.96s)]
*  And in fact, they have been sending missiles into Ukraine and injuring more people. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  During the course of this, we saw yesterday, Steve Wittkopf meeting with Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  So maybe the fact that that meeting just happened and the Zelensky meeting was a priority for [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=296.4s)]
*  President Trump today may mean that they are starting to see some movement here, which [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=301.28s)]
*  obviously would be just so welcome for all sides as we watch this unfold. But interesting. He said [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=307.12s)]
*  it went well. That was the word from the White House that was very productive. So we'll wait [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=313.76s)]
*  to hear some more details and hopefully it's moving in a positive direction. Well, it's a [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=318.23999999999995s)]
*  real indication of his priorities. I mean, it's one of the things he said he was going to do. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=321.67999999999995s)]
*  He wanted to wind down wars. I look at that image. I'm going to tell you, like, Dana, you're right. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=325.92s)]
*  I mean, the photographers captured it perfectly. I look at that inside of St. Peter's Cathedral [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  just before the funeral mass of Pope Francis, who also wanted an end to this war. And I think [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=337.6s)]
*  the thing that comes to my mind is blessed are the peacemakers. Blessed are the peacemakers. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=345.68s)]
*  And Donald Trump deserves credit for that. He's trying. He's trying. Absolutely. And let's hope [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=350.64s)]
*  he succeeds. It has been a really difficult chapter. And, you know, Putin, it looks like [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  Putin is the one who needs to come around. So let's hope that those product those conversations [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=362.96s)]
*  with Steve Wittkopf were productive as well. Yeah. And it's kind of amazing. It's that's just one of [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=367.2s)]
*  about 15 things, very large, major issues that this White House is juggling right now. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=372.56s)]
*  Well, we did we did notice earlier that, you know, President Trump, very much like what we saw at [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=381.2s)]
*  Notre Dame, there was a moment when he found his seat and there was kind of a crush of world leaders [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=386.32s)]
*  that were leaning in to to talk. I mean, obviously, they all want to get his ear. They'd all like to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=392.24s)]
*  work out some kind of agreement with these tariffs. So it is very interesting that his [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=397.68s)]
*  priority was to use the time that he had to speak to Vladimir Zemensky. Smart, smart, smart and wise. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=401.92s)]
*  Thank you, Martha. Thank you, Martha. Great coverage. Thank you all. Great to see you. Great [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=408.24s)]
*  to see you in the morning there, Dana. You know it. You guys. Thank you, Martha. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=412.24s)]
*  Thank you, Dana. Thank you, Martha. Thank you, Dana. Thank you, Dana. Thank you, Dana. Thank you, Dana. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfdOKtYIe6s&t=427.68s)]
