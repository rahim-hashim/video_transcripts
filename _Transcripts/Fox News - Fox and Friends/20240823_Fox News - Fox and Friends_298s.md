# 'HONED IN': Tulsi Gabbard offers update on Trump's debate prep
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY)
*  Let's go back to politics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=0.0s)]
*  Protests raging outside the DNC in Chicago. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=1.16s)]
*  Demonstrators call for Democrats to push for a ceasefire [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=4.0s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=7.0s)]
*  And they're pretty much anti-Semitic. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=8.76s)]
*  But inside the arena, the Vice President Harris [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=10.68s)]
*  appeared to play both sides of the issue. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=13.68s)]
*  I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=17.2s)]
*  because the people of Israel must never again face the horror [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=23.0s)]
*  that a terrorist organization called Hamas [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=28.4s)]
*  caused at the same time. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=31.72s)]
*  What has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=34.92s)]
*  So many innocent lives lost. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=40.44s)]
*  Yep, and the crowd got a lot louder [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=44.56s)]
*  on that second half of her statement, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=46.32s)]
*  trying to be both sides on the issue. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=48.32s)]
*  Former presidential candidate, former Democratic Congresswoman [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=49.959999999999994s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard joins us now to comment, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=52.64s)]
*  who famously debated on the same stage [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=54.64s)]
*  with Kamala Harris back in 2020. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=57.44s)]
*  First off, your reaction to that statement, Tulsi, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=59.16s)]
*  what did you get from it? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=61.92s)]
*  Well, like you said, she's playing both sides [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=64.44s)]
*  and she's trying to tell people what she thinks they want to hear. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=66.36s)]
*  You know, Kamala Harris, she only wants to win [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=72.28s)]
*  and her pollsters are telling her, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=74.96s)]
*  well, here's what we think you should say about this or that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=76.16s)]
*  You know, it was just a few days ago, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=79.16s)]
*  she said that she would support an arms embargo to Israel. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=80.56s)]
*  And in the very next day, either she or her staff [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=84.6s)]
*  walked that back. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=87.16s)]
*  I think it was very noticeable that in her speech [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=88.44s)]
*  and at no time so far has she been willing to speak the truth [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  about how Hamas is a radical Islamist terrorist group [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  that poses a threat not only to Israel, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=99.84s)]
*  but to all of civilization. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=102.52s)]
*  Their goal is to implement a caliphate, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  an Islamist caliphate around the world. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=108.52s)]
*  Nor has she laid out a plan of how to defeat this very real threat, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=110.92s)]
*  not only again for Israel, but for us. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=114.44000000000001s)]
*  How about defeating Hamas and every civilian deaths is on Hamas? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  And Iran is the problem. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  And when I last dealt with Iran, I signed off on a $6 billion [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=123.12s)]
*  cash deal to get our hostages out. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=127.04s)]
*  Obviously, by the definition, she'd never been taken to begin with. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=129.28s)]
*  Not getting to victory. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=133.08s)]
*  When she had a chance, Congresswoman, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=134.52s)]
*  to actually show herself with an ally, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=136.6s)]
*  she chose not to show up when Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=139.52s)]
*  addressed a joint session of Congress. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=143.0s)]
*  What should I read into that? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=144.8s)]
*  Should I listen to that speech or should I look at her actions? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=146.12s)]
*  And this exactly is what we have to do. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=151.08s)]
*  What voters need to pay attention to between now and Election Day [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=154.24s)]
*  on November 5th is don't listen to the words that she's throwing at us [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=157.64s)]
*  because they don't mean anything. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=162.0s)]
*  We have to look at her record and her actions. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=164.16s)]
*  She wants to be our president and commander in chief, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=167.0s)]
*  and yet at no time has she demonstrated that she has any capability [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=170.0s)]
*  or that she is fit to serve in that position. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=174.6s)]
*  In fact, she would be quite dangerous in that position. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=177.16s)]
*  And I have no doubt she would try to weaponize and use our military [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=180.08s)]
*  in order to try to cover up and mask her weakness and insecurity. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=184.84s)]
*  Tulsi, it's going to be a big day for the former president [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  if the reports are correct. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=192.0s)]
*  And RFK Jr. will appear with him in Arizona and say, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=193.44s)]
*  and I like all my supporters to go behind President Trump. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=197.92s)]
*  Who are his supporters? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=201.52s)]
*  You know him. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=202.8s)]
*  And what do you think this does to the election? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=203.96s)]
*  You know, his supporters are independent minded people who value freedom, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=207.72s)]
*  who are concerned about what President Biden and Vice President Harris [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=212.44s)]
*  have done to our country and leading us into the brink of multiple regime change wars, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=217.16s)]
*  the brink of World War Three and nuclear war. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=222.36s)]
*  They're concerned about this broken healthcare system [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  and the deep rot of corruption that is entrenched in almost every agency in our government. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  We'll see what Bobby Kennedy decides to do. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=234.76s)]
*  And you know, no vote should be taken for granted. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=237.16s)]
*  He'll have to make the case to his supporters [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=240.16s)]
*  about the very clear contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=242.6s)]
*  Kamala Harris standing for taking away our freedom, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  an increasingly tyrannical government, and more war versus Donald Trump, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  who stands for peace, prosperity and freedom. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=254.72s)]
*  Tell us real quick, you already met with the former president about with debate prep. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=257.64s)]
*  You went down there and told him what you know about Kamala Harris. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=261.32s)]
*  How's he doing? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=264.52s)]
*  He's doing great. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=266.68s)]
*  You know, I think you saw last night in his response to Kamala Harris's speech, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=267.96s)]
*  he knows the issues. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=272.68s)]
*  He is very honed in on her record in reminding voters. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=274.08s)]
*  As you started in this conversation, what have you done for the last three and a half years? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=277.8s)]
*  You can paint this rosy picture about what you're going to do, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=281.68s)]
*  but we're paying attention to what you've already done [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=284.16s)]
*  and how her policies have destroyed our economy, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=286.88000000000005s)]
*  made us less safe both here at home and abroad. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=290.12s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, thanks so much for stepping up for us this morning. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  Always great to see you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=295.88000000000005s)]
*  Thanks, Brian. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=296.76000000000005s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh__h3-1jlY&t=297.32000000000005s)]
