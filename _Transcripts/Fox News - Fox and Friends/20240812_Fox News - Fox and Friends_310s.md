# We've never seen anything like this: Thiessen
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg)
*  Kamala Harris has been the presumptive nominee for 22 days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=0.0s)]
*  You're looking at the calendar now, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=2.96s)]
*  and has yet to sit down for an interview with the press. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=4.4s)]
*  But that doesn't stop Democrats [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=6.8s)]
*  from defending her on every angle. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=8.6s)]
*  She did tons of interviews. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=13.0s)]
*  She's done interviews with you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  She's done interviews. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=16.48s)]
*  I'm sure she's gonna do interviews. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=17.48s)]
*  He is going to talk to the press. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=18.88s)]
*  When, here to react Fox News contributor Mark Thiessen. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=21.52s)]
*  Mark, have you ever seen anything like this? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=24.28s)]
*  No, you were just showing Tom Cruise [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=27.48s)]
*  jumping off of a building, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=28.92s)]
*  and she's afraid to take a question from a reporter. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=29.840000000000003s)]
*  That's where we are in this campaign. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=32.28s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump just did an hour long press conference. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  He went to the National Association of Black Journalists [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=36.88s)]
*  and took hostile questions from a hostile panel, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=39.52s)]
*  except for Harris, for over an hour. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=41.92s)]
*  And she's been a candidate for 22 days, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  and she's taken 90 seconds of questions at the tarmac. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=48.44s)]
*  And those were about when she's gonna take questions. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=51.0s)]
*  We've never had a less tested, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=53.28s)]
*  less examined candidate in the history of our country. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  She didn't go through a primary or a debate. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  She hasn't given a single substantive policy speech. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=62.76s)]
*  She hasn't done a town hall with voters [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=65.6s)]
*  like you would in a primary, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=67.62s)]
*  asking, taking questions from voters. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  She hasn't done a sit down media interview. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=70.32s)]
*  She hasn't held a press conference. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=72.06s)]
*  And on top of that, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=74.08s)]
*  she's even letting other people flip flop for her. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=75.44s)]
*  She's backing off of all of her previous positions, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=78.16s)]
*  but it's campaign aides who are doing it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=80.42s)]
*  She has not said a substantive thing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=82.02s)]
*  She's not laid out one policy proposal [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=84.8s)]
*  as candidate for president. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  She was DA and AG of a sanctuary state. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=87.84s)]
*  She is for defunding ICE, said that in the past. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=92.84s)]
*  And then we watched for the last three and a half years [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=97.0s)]
*  where she was borders, or whatever you wanna call it, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=99.08s)]
*  and didn't wanna go to the border. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  But now she's running and being strong in the border [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=102.38s)]
*  on putting these drug cartels on trial. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=104.88s)]
*  She's also now going to no longer tax tips. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=110.83999999999999s)]
*  Obviously those are two Donald Trump issues. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=116.08s)]
*  Is she gonna get away with this? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=119.02s)]
*  Well, first of all, she didn't just steal [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump's idea about taxing tips. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=123.24s)]
*  She plagiarized it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  Plagiarism is taking somebody else's idea [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=126.36s)]
*  and using it without credit. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=129.04s)]
*  She didn't say, I agree with Donald Trump. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=130.82s)]
*  We should not tax tips. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=132.62s)]
*  Here's an area where we agree. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=133.68s)]
*  She just stole it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=135.76s)]
*  And what's more stunning about that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=137.04s)]
*  is not that she stole the idea. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=139.32s)]
*  It's the only substantive economic policy [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  she's put forward as a candidate. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=144.28s)]
*  If you go to her website and click on the issues tab, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=146.12s)]
*  you can't do it because there is no issues tab. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=149.4s)]
*  It's literally fluff. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  All she talks about is, we're gonna fight for the future. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=155.68s)]
*  Well, what does that future look like? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=158.88s)]
*  She won't even take a question from a reporter asking, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=160.16s)]
*  explain to us, tell us what the wonderful future [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=162.44s)]
*  you have in store for us means. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=165.0s)]
*  It's just, I've never seen anything like it [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=167.28s)]
*  in my entire life. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=169.04s)]
*  See, Joe Biden was running on what he did. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=169.88s)]
*  And Joe, and Donald Trump was running on what he did. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=172.24s)]
*  And the American people were saying, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=175.28s)]
*  I prefer the other guy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=176.6s)]
*  Now she's running on someone she never, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=178.24s)]
*  as someone she never was and wants you to believe it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=181.52s)]
*  Will people buy that, that aren't, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  don't do this every day like we do 24 hours a day? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  So unless she's willing to say what she disagrees [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=195.28s)]
*  with Joe Biden on, like for example, the border, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=197.68s)]
*  she's like, she says, I'm not the borders czar. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=200.0s)]
*  She doesn't say that, other people say it for her. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=202.6s)]
*  Like, okay, what did you disagree with [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=204.52s)]
*  in Biden's border policy? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=206.2s)]
*  And what would you do differently? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=207.6s)]
*  And the answer is, I would have given healthcare [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  to illegal migrants. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=210.88s)]
*  I would have decriminalized illegal border crossings [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=212.32s)]
*  and created a bigger magnet for people to come over. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=214.76s)]
*  So under my administration, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=217.1s)]
*  the border crisis would actually be worse, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=218.86s)]
*  but she doesn't get asked those questions [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=220.6s)]
*  because she's not willing to put herself [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=222.2s)]
*  in front of the media to do this, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  most of whom are friendly. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  Most of whom are in the tank for her and want her to win [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  because they think stopping Trump is the number one priority [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=231.32s)]
*  that she can't find somebody because she's not confident [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  to go in front of these reporters and take tough questions. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=236.73999999999998s)]
*  Real quick, Bob, if the Trump team's watching right now, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=238.88s)]
*  how do you make someone do an interview [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=242.0s)]
*  if you're someone doing an interview? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=244.33999999999997s)]
*  Tonight, for example, he'll do an interview [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  with Elon Musk for an hour, will President Trump. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=248.16s)]
*  On Wednesday, he's gonna do a speech about the economy, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  maybe take questions there, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=254.2s)]
*  and then Saturday, he's gonna do another rally. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=255.04s)]
*  How do you get Vice President Kamala Harris to do something? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=256.52s)]
*  By doing what exactly what they're doing, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=263.76s)]
*  modeling the way a proper campaign is run. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=265.32s)]
*  Go and give speeches, go give press conferences, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=267.6s)]
*  focus on the issues. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=270.4s)]
*  Her weakness is that she's all fluff [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=272.2s)]
*  and covering up her left-wing policies [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=274.6s)]
*  by not talking about policy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=277.0s)]
*  So go out, give some substantive policy speeches, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=278.6s)]
*  lay out your economic agenda, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=281.46s)]
*  lay out your foreign policy agenda, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=282.72s)]
*  lay out your education agenda, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=284.12s)]
*  and say, why won't she do the same thing? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, if that's the way to get her to do it [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=288.44000000000005s)]
*  is to shame her into it, eventually the media will demand it [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  because they're getting it from Trump. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=293.76000000000005s)]
*  Gotcha, he is Mark T. C. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=295.32000000000005s)]
*  and you can read him in the Washington Post [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=296.76000000000005s)]
*  and watch him all over the channel. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=297.88000000000005s)]
*  Thanks, Mark. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRgQd8nkSg&t=298.84000000000003s)]
