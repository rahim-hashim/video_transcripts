# 'TIME FOR CHANGE': George Gascon's 'social experiment' has 'failed', challenger says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4)
*  Soft on crime and Soros backed district attorney George Gascogne now facing a possible [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=0.0s)]
*  ouster by voters in November. A new LA Times poll showing challenger Nathan Hockman with a [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=5.34s)]
*  massive 30 point lead. LADA candidate and former U.S. Assistant Attorney General Nathan [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=10.86s)]
*  Hockman joins us now. Nathan, look, we always ask when, when will voters in these far left [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=17.06s)]
*  cities finally wake up and vote in their own best interest? Is now the time in your race? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=24.66s)]
*  I think now is the time. I think voters have both experienced the statistics that have [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=31.060000000000002s)]
*  shown over the last four years. Violent crimes, property crimes, hate crimes, shoplifting, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=37.38s)]
*  human trafficking, fentanyl poisonings are up double or triple digits. I think people have said [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=44.1s)]
*  enough is enough. I've talked to thousands of people across the political spectrum, the demographic [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=49.62s)]
*  spectrum, even the geographic spectrum here in LA County. And people come to me and say, look, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=55.379999999999995s)]
*  we are tired of our homes being broken into, our cars being broken into. We're tired of watching [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=60.74s)]
*  50, 12 to 15 year olds take their bikes to a 7-Eleven, ransack the place and literally just bike out. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=66.98s)]
*  And they're saying, okay, we gave George Gascogne three and a half years to run his social [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=74.58s)]
*  experiment. It is failed and now it's time for change. I've talked to a number of people who [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=78.74s)]
*  still live in LA or have fled LA who refer to this time period, 2020 to 2023, as George Gascogne's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=84.58s)]
*  reign of terror. And the numbers bear that out in their defense. Violent crime to your point, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=91.3s)]
*  up 12%. Robbery is up 16%. Property crimes, up 20%. Shoplifting, heck, it's basically allowed at [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=95.78s)]
*  this point, up 133%. Auto theft, up 23%. Burglary's up 8%. So on day one of a Nathan Hockman [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=102.58s)]
*  administration, what will you do to save Los Angeles? So what I will do is the opposite of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=111.14s)]
*  George Gascogne. I'll actually work with the 750 prosecutors who do all the work, the tens of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=117.86s)]
*  thousands of law enforcement officers. I'll have all the victim groups there because I'll resume [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=123.86s)]
*  being their champion. And we'll eliminate all the extreme pro-criminal policies of George Gascogne, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=129.3s)]
*  not replacing them, by the way, with mass incarceration policies, but a hard middle [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=135.3s)]
*  approach. And the reason it's hard, you're going to do the work, the hard work of looking at each [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=140.34s)]
*  case individually, the crime committed, the impact on the victim, the defendant's background to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=144.74s)]
*  determine who the true threats are to our public safety and need to be behind bars and quite [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=150.5s)]
*  honestly the ones that aren't. A first-time nonviolent offender still has to pay their debt [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=155.3s)]
*  back to society, but that can be community service, restitution or even a diversion program. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  Gascogne said he came from way behind in 2020, that he expects to win again, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=166.58s)]
*  albeit by a tight margin. Your response to George Gascogne? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=170.58s)]
*  George Gascogne has been, we call him George Gaslight Gascogne, because he's been gaslighting [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=175.86s)]
*  the public for the over four years, basically saying that crime is down but fear is up. Well, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=182.02s)]
*  he's half right. Fear is up because crime is up. It's a shame what's happening to Los Angeles, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  Los Angeles County. Seems like the only thing good you have going for you right now is those [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=194.18s)]
*  Dodgers. We'll see if a Nathan Hockman time as DA will change the crime situation there in the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=198.34s)]
*  City of Angels. Nathan Hockman, thank you for your time. Appreciate it. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3Q38pT9j4&t=204.9s)]
