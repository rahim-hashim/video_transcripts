# Officials uncover secret drug tunnel near border wall
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0)
*  Well, U.S. and Mexican officials discovering a secret tunnel in Mexico near the border [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=0.0s)]
*  wall with the help of drones last month. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=5.72s)]
*  Mexican police call it a narco tunnel used for trafficking drugs and people into the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=8.76s)]
*  U.S. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=13.64s)]
*  It's the third time one of these tunnels was found near Yuma, Arizona last year. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=14.64s)]
*  Executive Director for the Center for a Secure and Free Society Visiting Fellow at the Heritage [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=19.32s)]
*  Foundation, foundation, Joseph Humeier joins us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=24.6s)]
*  Joseph, good to see you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=29.48s)]
*  So I was struck by the fact that this was found by both U.S. officials in coordination [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=30.88s)]
*  with Mexican officials. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=38.52s)]
*  Does that tell us anything about maybe the Mexican authorities realizing that they're [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=40.88s)]
*  going to have to start actually participating in securing the border? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=47.36s)]
*  Well, we've had good cooperation with Mexican authorities on tactical issues. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=51.28s)]
*  What happens is when you want to get to strategic issues or when you want to get to a very high [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=57.44s)]
*  level against the Mexican cartels, that cooperation tends to break down, particularly under the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=60.4s)]
*  most recent government. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=65.08s)]
*  But there's a new government in Mexico and there's a new president in the United States, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=66.08s)]
*  so I'm hoping that that cooperation could enhance. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=69.0s)]
*  But as far as the tunnels, I mean, we have this refrain in the military. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=71.8s)]
*  We say, amateurs talk strategy, but professionals talk logistics. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  And what you see on the border is some of the most advanced logistical networks that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=78.64s)]
*  the cartels build because they're powered by massive amounts of money. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=82.84s)]
*  I mean, you have the global drug industry, that's three hundred sixty billion dollars. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=86.56s)]
*  The human trafficking industry has two hundred forty billion dollars. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=90.2s)]
*  I mean, the amount of money that's being poured onto these illicit enterprises is giving them [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=92.96s)]
*  all the best technologies to go around law enforcement. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=96.88s)]
*  So this is going to be a major challenge, I think, for both the Mexican government and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=99.44s)]
*  the new Trump administration. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=102.88s)]
*  And they need to focus on this logistics because it's the logistics that power to just like [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=104.0s)]
*  it does in a war. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=107.96s)]
*  The supply lines power the the the militaries. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=108.96s)]
*  In this case, the logistics power the cartels and allows them to do all the stuff that they [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=112.0s)]
*  do. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=116.08s)]
*  Just want to look you to consider this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=117.08s)]
*  So this has just come out that this is a new stat. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=119.96s)]
*  Violent drug cartels are now Mexico's fifth largest employer. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=122.56s)]
*  They're operating right along the southern border, but also inside of Mexico. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=127.88s)]
*  I've been concerned for a long time. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=131.12s)]
*  As you know, Joseph, we've been having these conversations for a while that the open border [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=133.28s)]
*  and the enrichment and empowering of these cartels would turn Mexico into a narco state. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=137.96s)]
*  Is that where we're at right now? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=145.12s)]
*  If they're the fifth largest employer, that's insane. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=146.12s)]
*  No, that's that's 100 percent the direction that Mexico is going. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=149.36s)]
*  This is a tremendous concern. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=153.88s)]
*  We cannot afford for Mexico to become a Venezuela. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=155.06s)]
*  It's our neighbor, it's our trade partner, and we share a very long border. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=158.0s)]
*  And what happens and this is the biggest concern, especially on these border towns, is as you [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=162.52s)]
*  know, Rachel, like for enterprise doesn't stop just because you stop governing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=166.2s)]
*  So basically at any given moment, society has two enterprises, right, a free enterprise [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=171.8s)]
*  that we're all involved in and then an illegal and illicit enterprise. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=175.44s)]
*  And when the illicit enterprise, the incentives are driven more towards predation and production, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=179.44s)]
*  the illicit enterprise takes over the free enterprise. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=184.08s)]
*  That means it becomes rentable. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=186.28s)]
*  One day you're a truck driver for a multinational, the next day you're a truck driver for a cartel. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=187.44s)]
*  And that's what's happening on these border towns. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=191.84s)]
*  The incentives are aligning so that the illicit enterprise is dominating the free enterprise. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=193.28s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=197.78s)]
*  Because the Mexican government, the Mexican economy has not been boosted up. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=198.78s)]
*  It's been stifled down. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=203.38s)]
*  That was the big problem with Lopez Obrador's policies, his policies of nationalizing the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=204.38s)]
*  oil industry, of going after the private sector was pushing more and more of the incentives [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=209.1s)]
*  towards the cartels. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=213.82s)]
*  And they were taking over these towns. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=215.08s)]
*  And not to mention our open border, open border basically just gave all the money, all the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=216.72s)]
*  incentives into the illicit enterprise. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's why we have the problem that we have today. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Joseph, many Americans don't understand that in many towns, the cartel is the police [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=224.18s)]
*  for that town. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=228.38000000000002s)]
*  They are the security for that town. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=229.38000000000002s)]
*  And obviously this corrupts politicians as well. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=230.58s)]
*  If I need to operate in this area, I've got to coordinate with the cartels. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  This is a very dangerous situation. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=238.10000000000002s)]
*  They are our closest and most important neighbor. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=239.62s)]
*  So this is a big task for the Trump administration moving forward. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=242.46s)]
*  Joseph Humeyer, you're always on top of these issues. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=245.82000000000002s)]
*  We appreciate you joining us. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=247.78000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=249.78000000000003s)]
*  And most compelling analysis. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLSUb8JrC0&t=258.36s)]
