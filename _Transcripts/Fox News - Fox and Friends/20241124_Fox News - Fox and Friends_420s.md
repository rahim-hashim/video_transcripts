# The left is ‘totally off the rails’ on this: Rep. Nancy Mace
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ)
*  Over the last week, Putin is retaliating with new ballistic missiles after Biden allowed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Ukraine to fire long-range U.S. missiles into Russia. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=6.76s)]
*  And while Democrats applaud the move, Republicans, including our next guest, questioned the timing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=11.52s)]
*  just months before he leaves office. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=17.26s)]
*  GOP Congresswoman Nancy May sits on the House Armed Services Committee, and she joins us [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Welcome, Congresswoman. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=28.88s)]
*  So we've been trying to break this down and unpack this all morning long, trying to figure [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=29.88s)]
*  out why Joe Biden at this stage in particular would allow American-made long-range missiles [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=33.28s)]
*  to be used by Ukraine to go into Russia. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=39.8s)]
*  Why do you think that Joe Biden or whoever is running his government at this moment would [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=43.26s)]
*  allow for this to happen at this moment, during this transitional period? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=48.72s)]
*  They're doing it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  Yeah, they're doing this because Donald Trump won. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  And not only did he just win. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  It wasn't just simply a win. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=58.08s)]
*  It was a resounding mandate on the issue of Ukraine and a lot of other issues, like illegal [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=59.8s)]
*  immigration, inflation and government spending. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  And they're doing this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=66.92s)]
*  They'll do anything that they can to undermine Donald Trump as he enters office. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=68.52s)]
*  And Republicans made very clear last week that this was an escalation of war weeks before [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=72.64s)]
*  Trump is to be sworn in, and he wants to de-escalate the situation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=78.3s)]
*  And we saw just three days ago Putin fire a hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=82.53999999999999s)]
*  missile into Ukraine. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=87.3s)]
*  And it was an immediate escalation of war. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=90.17999999999999s)]
*  And that is the last thing the world needs right now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=94.7s)]
*  Where do the Republicans... [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=95.7s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure you're really familiar with where the conference is, just on this whole [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=97.53999999999999s)]
*  issue of how close we are to World War III at this moment. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=102.2s)]
*  I mean, we've never been so close. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=106.3s)]
*  Where is the Republican conference? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=109.06s)]
*  I know that there are different opinions about whether we should be in the war or not. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=110.62s)]
*  Is everyone backing Donald Trump as far as not just de-escalating, but really bringing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=116.1s)]
*  about a peace agreement here? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=120.82s)]
*  Well, first of all, I can tell you, no one wants Ukraine to lose. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=122.86s)]
*  I mean, no one wants Putin to win here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=126.66s)]
*  But when you look at the situation with Ukraine, when you look at the way that Iran is emboldened [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=129.29999999999998s)]
*  and Hamas and Israel, the Hezbollah, the Houthis, Yemen, the trifecta of Iran, China and Russia, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=134.82s)]
*  terrorism and terrorists feel emboldened. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=143.34s)]
*  I think there is a real opportunity for peace, but it's not going to happen until Donald [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=146.62s)]
*  Trump takes office and can negotiate that peace with these folks, with Putin and with [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=151.06s)]
*  Ukraine as well. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=156.9s)]
*  It's not going to happen until Trump is sworn in. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=158.62s)]
*  We have just a few weeks more to go. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=160.06s)]
*  And I think everybody in the conference, and I hope that they feel this way, that does [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=161.5s)]
*  want peace overseas, that want these crises and these conflicts to end. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=164.82s)]
*  But with his leadership, we can't do it until he's president of the United States. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=168.38s)]
*  Yeah. So we're all holding our breath, hoping nothing happens. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=172.06s)]
*  In the meantime, it's really unfortunate. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=175.22s)]
*  Congressman, let's talk about this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=177.66s)]
*  You've been in the press quite a bit because there is a trans member of Congress now who [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=178.78s)]
*  wants to use the women's restroom. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=184.74s)]
*  And you've been adamantly opposed to that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=187.78s)]
*  Talk to us about about that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=190.3s)]
*  And then I want to play a clip of a very prominent Democrat congresswoman, AOC, and what [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=191.82000000000002s)]
*  her response has been. But first, tell us your position and lay that out for us. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=197.62s)]
*  Well, it's sad and surprising that in 2024, I have to go on TV and on social media to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=201.58s)]
*  explain to the radical left that men shouldn't be allowed in women's restrooms, that women [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=208.66000000000003s)]
*  shouldn't be forced to undress in front of men. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=213.82000000000002s)]
*  I'm a rape survivor and I know how vulnerable women are in personal and private spaces. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=217.26000000000002s)]
*  And I'm going to make sure that I protect all women and girls. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=222.82000000000002s)]
*  And there are a lot of women out there, millions of women across the country who agree with [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=225.82000000000002s)]
*  me, but they're afraid to come forward because of the way that the radical left acts, the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=229.7s)]
*  threats that we've been receiving hundreds a day. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=234.78s)]
*  It's unsafe. I've been accosted several times over the last several days by folks in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=238.14s)]
*  public. The left is totally off the rails on this just because women don't want to be [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=243.18s)]
*  forced to undress in front of men. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=247.86s)]
*  Right. This is about a bathroom in Congress. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=249.34s)]
*  But as you know, there are trans, there are men who are now in women's prisons and women's [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=252.62s)]
*  domestic shelters, and these are all causing women to not feel safe. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=258.3s)]
*  Here's the response of AOC. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=262.06s)]
*  Listen. What Nancy Mace and what Speaker Johnson are doing are endangering all women [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=264.1s)]
*  and girls, because if you ask them, what is your plan on how to enforce this? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=271.38s)]
*  They won't come up with an answer. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=276.7s)]
*  And what it inevitably results in are women and girls who are primed for assault because [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=278.26s)]
*  they want because people are going to want to check their private parts in suspecting who is [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=284.86s)]
*  trans and who is cis and who's doing what, because she wants to suspect and point fingers at [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=289.38s)]
*  who she thinks is trans is disgusting. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=294.62s)]
*  OK, that doesn't even make sense to me. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=298.1s)]
*  Can you make sense of it? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=300.62s)]
*  No, I can't. First of all, she can't even she's not telling the truth. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=303.1s)]
*  No one has ever said that women should drop trial. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=306.14s)]
*  That's that's really disgusting. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=308.65999999999997s)]
*  And to say that about me, a survivor of rape and sexual abuse, it's really that's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=310.1s)]
*  the height of hypocrisy. And it it just goes to show that their lie, they don't they don't [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=314.82s)]
*  want to protect women. They never have wanted to protect women. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=320.3s)]
*  And their policies will only endanger more women and girls. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=322.65999999999997s)]
*  And that's what I've been saying for years now, that Republicans and conservatives, we are the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=326.74s)]
*  party of women. We will fight to protect women. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=331.1s)]
*  We'll do a really good job of it when we're in charge. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=333.3s)]
*  And so I'm going to keep calling out these folks on the left. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=336.21999999999997s)]
*  They don't they don't they don't get a say. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=339.26s)]
*  I mean, this is it's just ludicrous to me that women who are victims of abuse should be [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=341.26000000000005s)]
*  forced to undress or go to the bathroom next to a man. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=346.62s)]
*  I mean, I just I can't even that's why millions of women are supporting me. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=349.1s)]
*  That's why we're winning the message. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=352.54s)]
*  And so many women now today feel more brave and have more courage because I've been [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=353.94000000000005s)]
*  speaking out. They feel like they are going to be supported now. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  We're going to see this all across the country and we're hearing from folks all around the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=361.74s)]
*  world, women from all sorts of countries now coming out and supporting us in our effort. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=364.54s)]
*  Yeah, for the record, that trans member of Congress has said that he will he will actually [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=369.58000000000004s)]
*  abide by the rules and not use the women's restroom in Congress. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=374.7s)]
*  I think Marjorie Taylor Green came out with an idea. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=379.14s)]
*  She said, well, maybe we should just have a Democrat women's bathroom and a Republican [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=381.3s)]
*  women's bathroom. And then the Democrats can just open the doors to the trans those. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=386.54s)]
*  And also what what AOC said about not being able to recognize it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=391.78000000000003s)]
*  I've seen Rachel Levine. I know that's not a woman. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=395.5s)]
*  So I don't understand this idea. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=397.90000000000003s)]
*  But Nancy Bates, you've taken a lot of abuse for standing up for the rights of women, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=400.86s)]
*  especially in their private spaces. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=404.86s)]
*  And we appreciate that. Thanks so much. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=406.46000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNkJnsKtXWQ&t=408.98s)]
