*  Now to this now to the drama over the big beautiful bill [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, remember that president Trump says he has not thought too hard about getting a formal apology for Elon Musk [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=3.62s)]
*  Oh, by the way, roasted the bill after they reportedly spoke over the phone on Monday [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=9.9s)]
*  Alexandra Hoff is at the White House with all the details. Hey Alexandra [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=14.56s)]
*  Hi, good morning to you. Yeah, fortunately for Elon Musk [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=17.88s)]
*  He clearly developed a good rapport good working relationship with several key members of the administration during his 130 days while he was working with it [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=20.56s)]
*  One of those being White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=28.52s)]
*  The New York Times reports that Wiles and Musk actually spoke on Friday as well as Musk and Vice President [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=31.22s)]
*  Vance about a path to a truce with the president [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=37.0s)]
*  This gave way to the reported Monday night phone call between President Trump and Elon Musk [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=39.72s)]
*  Vance said at the Kennedy Center last night [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=43.96s)]

*  Entrepreneurs to also be supportive of the president to also be supportive of the president and our agenda if he doesn't I think that will [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=49.84s)]
*  Ultimately be Elon Musk's loss, but I suspect that Elon Musk very much wants to be on the team [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=56.76s)]
*  Now Monday's reported phone call led to the billionaire expressing regret over the social media sledgehammer [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=62.96s)]

*  I [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  Think he hasn't thought too much about it [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=88.44s)]
*  Well overall the president explained the situation to you know to New York Post columnist Miranda Devine listen to this [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=90.26s)]
*  Could you reconcile with him? Do you think could you forgive him? I guess I could but you know [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=96.52s)]
*  We have to straighten out the country. Yeah, and my sole function now is getting this country back to a level [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=100.28s)]

*  Yeah, the president has been very measured really in his responses to Elon Musk the questions [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=111.74s)]
*  He has fielded about that relationship and Musk in recent days has taken to X this time to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=115.94s)]

*  All right. Thanks, Alexandria. Appreciate it [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7PO2SssE&t=128.14s)]
