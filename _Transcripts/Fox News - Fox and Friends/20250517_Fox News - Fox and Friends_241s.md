# Comey has his fingerprints on ‘a lot of bad things,’ expert warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ)
*  Former FBI director James Comey in some hot water meeting face-to-face with secret service officials last evening [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks to his now deleted social media post that read quote cool shell formation on the beach that spells out [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=6.84s)]
*  8647 raising red flags to officials as it should as the number [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  86 is a common call sign used for murder or to get rid of someone while the number [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=19.48s)]
*  47 of course is seen as signifying Trump [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=25.28s)]
*  Congressman Rick Crawford serves as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and he joins us now. So mr. Chairman, are you buying? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=28.5s)]
*  James Comey's claim that he just had no idea what this meant [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=36.980000000000004s)]
*  He just thought it was a neat picture and he was gonna put it on his on his web page [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  Not at all now that's ridiculous and and he shouldn't be selling it [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=48.02s)]
*  It's insane that somebody that was in the position that he was in FBI director [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=52.18000000000001s)]
*  Whatever his his political [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=57.04s)]
*  Leanings are now he was an FBI director and you think the American people are gonna buy that you just happened on this random [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=59.92s)]
*  Shell formation and had no idea what that might mean [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=67.04s)]
*  Give me a break. This guy is like, you know an eighth grader in the back of the classroom with the behavioral problem [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=70.16s)]
*  Jumping up and down waving his hand saying hey, don't forget about me. I'm still here. It's just ridiculous [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=76.04s)]
*  Is it that or is he signaling something? I mean listen, first of all, we have a cabinet member [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  Who had his own father assassinated his uncle assassinated? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=86.64s)]
*  We have a sitting president who's had two attempts on his life by Democrats, by the way [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  I'm not buying all this, you know stuff that it's some foreign country. Those were Democrats [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  Call me a Democrat somebody who has actively tried to take down the president with with the fake Russia collusion case [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  What are going to be the consequences for this because something has to happen [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  Sure. So the first thing we know is that obviously there was a referral made to the Secret Service [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=115.76s)]
*  That's appropriate any time there's a threat against the president and they're taking the appropriate action [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  Keep in mind that the Secret Service comes under the jurisdiction of DHS, which is Secretary Nums Lane [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  But there may also be criminal proceedings under FBI director and Pam Bondi [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  So this is there needs to be a you know, a whole of federal law enforcement approach to this [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  So we're seeing that already underway [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=140.08s)]
*  The other issue is as you mentioned, you know some of the some of the history of Komi [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  Russiagate was one of those but think back to 2017 in June of that of that year when [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  There was an assassination attempt against Steve's police and many others on a baseball field [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=154.16s)]
*  Republicans we just after eight years [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=159.6s)]
*  We just got that report from the FBI that investigation and he was a part of that even though it was the Komi culture [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  It was McCabe that engaged in the cover-up primarily, but he was responsible for you know, establishing that culture [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=169.12s)]
*  and so [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  Komi has his fingerprints on an awful lot of bad things and and keep in mind that what? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=177.4s)]
*  Prompted this shooter in the case of the 2017 shooting at the at the Republican baseball practice was political rhetoric [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=182.28s)]
*  It was this inciting [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=190.36s)]
*  To violence that he had been listening to Bernie Sanders [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=192.36s)]
*  And so a guy like Komi when you've already seen two [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=196.24s)]
*  assassination attempts against President Trump and he comes out and and then and you know this innocuous [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=199.6s)]
*  Oh look what I just happened on here on the beach on my morning stroll on the beach [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=204.72s)]
*  That is that's not a dog whistle. That's a bullhorn for some people [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=208.72s)]
*  I couldn't agree more [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=213.12s)]
*  Well congressman, uh, Rick Crawford, um, we really appreciate you joining us today and we'll follow up on what's happening [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=214.56s)]
*  All of us want to see consequences [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=220.56s)]
*  Um, we know that there certainly would be if it was a republican if it was reversed [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=222.48s)]
*  So we appreciate you joining us this morning. Thank you so much [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhiIB-79nNQ&t=226.39999999999998s)]
