# Pope Francis posts on social media, writes he's thankful for 'messages of affection,' prayers
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4)
*  We're paying close attention to the health of Pope Francis this morning as the Vatican says he had had a restful night [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=0.0s)]
*  But remains in critical condition after suffering a respiratory crisis on Saturday [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=6.88s)]
*  Correspondent Jeff Paul just got to Rome and he joins us right now just outside the hospital there where the pontiff is [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=12.96s)]
*  Resting at this hour. Hi Jeff [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=20.6s)]
*  Yeah, hey there [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=24.36s)]
*  Well, there's truly a somber feeling here outside the Gemelli hospital in Rome where Pope Francis is currently recovering [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=25.259999999999998s)]
*  We've seen lots of people showing up to the medical center to pray for the Pope [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=31.58s)]
*  Especially after the Vatican used two words [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=35.82s)]
*  They haven't used before critical condition to describe the Pope's health [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=38.58s)]
*  But even with that being said we do know from their latest update that the Pope today is awake [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  He is receiving oxygen [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  But he is breathing on his own and he's even doing well enough to post on social media today [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=51.18s)]
*  Just a little while ago posting this on X saying in part that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=56.38s)]
*  Basically thanking people for their closeness and prayers that are coming in from all over the world now on top of that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=60.300000000000004s)]
*  We are learning the Pope again. He is awake [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  He's eating and officials have said the crisis is over at least for now [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=68.06s)]
*  The 88 year old has been receiving high flows of oxygen to help him breathe after suffering from a prolonged [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=72.86s)]
*  Asthmatic respiratory crisis a Pope Francis has also received blood transfusions due to a low blood [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=78.78s)]
*  Platelet count the Pope was admitted February 14th and has been getting treatment for double pneumonia and a complex lung infection [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=85.82000000000001s)]
*  It's worth pointing out though throughout this last more than week stay at the hospital Pope Francis has been fully conscious [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=93.66000000000001s)]
*  He's been eating working and reading [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=99.94000000000001s)]
*  Those who've been gathering both here at the hospital and at st [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=102.82000000000001s)]
*  Peter's Square say they feel it's very important to show up and make the trip. I [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=105.9s)]
*  came here for the Pope and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=111.5s)]
*  it's a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=114.46000000000001s)]
*  Symbolic time and I think that all the prayers and the support that he can get we we must must [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=116.06s)]
*  We must support the Pope at this moment. The voice of the Pope is so important at the moment [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  the world is full of hatred and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=128.46s)]
*  He's a he's a voice of love [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=131.9s)]
*  He echoes what Christ told us 2,000 years ago [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=134.45999999999998s)]
*  So we need him a lot and we hope that he will be healthy very soon [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=137.94s)]
*  Now there are a few factors impacting his condition and his road to recovery [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=145.98s)]
*  He's 88 years old and doctors have said his age makes his condition a bit touch-and-go at times [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=149.7s)]
*  He's also had a large portion of one of his lungs removed when he was young [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=155.17999999999998s)]
*  So that only adds to his fragile state now [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  We are learning that the White House is aware President Trump has been briefed at least on Saturday about the latest [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  With Pope Francis's condition and press secretary Caroline Levitt saying that they are all praying for him back to you all [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=167.85999999999999s)]
*  Jeff Paul, thank you so much. Thank you [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=174.94s)]
*  Yeah, well we Catholics are very accustomed to keeping vigil on Pope's in these conditions. And so we do that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=177.7s)]
*  Absolutely, right [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=184.62s)]
*  You [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzXXM2SAtj4&t=189.54s)]
