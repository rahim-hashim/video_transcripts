# Judge Merchan determined to 'stain' Trump as convicted felon: Jarrett says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE)
*  President-elect Trump slamming Judge Murchand's decision to sentence him in New York City on Friday, posting this quote on Truth Social, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=0.0s)]
*  The legal system is broken and businesses can't take a chance in getting caught up in this quicksand. It's all rigged. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=7.48s)]
*  It's this case against a political opponent, me. And while DA Alvin Bragg and Murchand have their sights set on Trump, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=14.36s)]
*  they're ignoring the rampant crime in New York City. I'm not kidding. Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett writes that Murchand is desperate to brand Trump as a convicted judge. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  He's a felon before his inauguration. He joins us now. Greg, you believe and the president believes this is personal. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=30.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. I think Murchand is desperate to stain the incoming president with the label convicted felon. And understand, Brian, under the law, Trump is not officially convicted of anything [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=38.24s)]
*  until he's formally sentenced, even though many in the media, of course, began immediately and incorrectly calling him a convicted felon when the jury verdict came in. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=50.800000000000004s)]
*  And that was the whole goal of indicting Trump and putting him on trial. Democrats assumed their politically driven lawfare campaign would destroy him. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=60.72s)]
*  Instead, you know, it had the opposite effect. Voters sought for what it was, a corrupt weaponization of the law, and it backfired spectacularly. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=71.0s)]
*  Many Americans recognize this was a sham trial, a preordained outcome. It drove a lot of them to Donald Trump, and he won. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=80.84s)]
*  Right. And he just actually dominated the election cycle. It just put to the side his whole primary challenge. And he, you know, for better or for worse, he just dominated it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=89.68s)]
*  I know he just wants it over with and doesn't want to relive it. But just think about the consistency or the lack thereof. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=99.92s)]
*  When you come to New York City and Alvin Bragg, another George Soros-funded DA who thinks criminal first, if you look at their misdemeanor and their downgrades, look at this full screen, you had 2,365 misdemeanors [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  were downgraded from felonies. You had 2,188 to a violation of 1,193. So you have a situation where serious crimes are downgraded when it comes to Trump. They put all these misdemeanors together to make it a felony and put them on trial. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=118.48s)]
*  Yeah. And it's, you know, one of the reasons why these George Soros-funded progressive district attorneys have ruined major cities in blue states. And, you know, Alvin Bragg is a prime example. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=135.52s)]
*  You know, if you're Trump, a misdemeanor business records violation somehow becomes a phantom felony. And in the end, nobody actually knew what he was convicted of. And it wasn't a unanimous jury verdict, the best we can tell. Nobody really knows. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=152.8s)]
*  So it becomes a bedrock violation. You know, Bragg goes after, you know, good Samaritans like Daniel Penny or a bodega worker who dared to defend himself when he was attacked. And he goes after a politician for purely political reasons. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=173.04s)]
*  This is what Alvin Bragg has wrought to New York City. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=192.32s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IL2n18ydSE&t=222.32s)]
