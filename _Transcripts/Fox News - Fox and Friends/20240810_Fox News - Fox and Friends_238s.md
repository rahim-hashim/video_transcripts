# Kamala Harris' failed policies create a level playing field, says Arizona voter
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts)
*  Kamala Harris in Las Vegas today as a new poll across swing states including [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=0.0s)]
*  Nevada show her neck and neck with Trump. Harris's campaign also releasing a new [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=4.94s)]
*  ad in English and Spanish targeting the Latino voters in those states but [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=10.5s)]
*  Arizona's GOP has an ad of their own calling out Harris for not fixing the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=16.5s)]
*  border. Here to react is Monet Flores-Bach, a Republican voter in Arizona [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=21.54s)]
*  and a strategic director at the Libra Initiative. Welcome Monet, tell us what [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=27.78s)]
*  you're seeing on the ground. I know Libra does a really good job of grassroots [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=32.660000000000004s)]
*  work. What are Latinos in your state saying? Well thank you for having me. I [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=36.5s)]
*  believe that Hispanics like most Americans are just asking themselves, am [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  I better off than I was four years ago? And this administration is not empowering [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=46.86s)]
*  Latinos to reach their full potential. Our community is looking for candidates [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=51.46s)]
*  that are pro-energy, pro-economic growth and she's had four years in this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=55.22s)]
*  administration to prove that she cared about the economy and immigration. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=59.18s)]
*  Instead now vice president is going to have to defend these policies that have [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=62.9s)]
*  left immigrants waiting for answers, Americans worried for their safety [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=67.34s)]
*  because of the open border, an economy where the average age of a homebuyer is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=71.22s)]
*  now 36 compared to 33 in 2020 and Americans are approximately paying [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=75.22s)]
*  $12,000 more a year than when she took office. So we're all feeling the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=80.53999999999999s)]
*  pain of this broken economy thanks to this administration's failed policies. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=85.14s)]
*  Yeah I mean look at this poll though, Harris still holding a lead over Latino [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=88.66s)]
*  voters. If you look at them as a whole, 58% support Kamala Harris, 42 for Donald [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=93.78s)]
*  Trump, but people have to remember those numbers for Donald Trump for Republican [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=98.9s)]
*  candidate are incredible. I mean it wasn't very long ago that Republicans [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=104.18s)]
*  were in the 20s with Hispanics. Donald Trump definitely on the move. What do you [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=108.9s)]
*  think Donald Trump, President Donald Trump should do in these last you know [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=113.82s)]
*  90 days before the election? More rallies, what should he do in order to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=118.1s)]
*  capture and catch up to Kamala Harris? Well I do believe that her [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=125.05999999999999s)]
*  failed policies create a level playing field where they both have to talk about [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=130.98s)]
*  solutions rather than your status quo political promises. Our community is [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=135.06s)]
*  looking for the candidates that are going to deliver on real policy solutions [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=140.3s)]
*  and we want candidates that will tear down barriers for a community that are [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  pro-energy, pro-economic growth and actually deliver on immigration reform. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  You know one of the attacks from the left on Donald Trump is he's a racist. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=152.46s)]
*  Interestingly the Trump campaign ad in Nevada is that he's gonna double down on [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=156.82000000000002s)]
*  closing the border and that's his ad for Hispanics. Talk to me about that. Yeah I [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=162.82000000000002s)]
*  really believe that the Hispanic community is just frustrated with where [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  we're at regarding immigration and 2022 Harris said that the border is secure. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=172.17999999999998s)]
*  However since this administration took office US Customs and Border Protection [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=177.22s)]
*  has logged more than 7.8 million illegal border crossings and I don't know about [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=181.78s)]
*  you but that doesn't sound very secure to me. Meanwhile hard-working [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  individuals who would be great assets to this country, I have family members in [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=191.18s)]
*  other countries that are also still waiting in limbo because this [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=195.86s)]
*  administration did not deliver on real immigration reform. Yeah it's usually [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=198.86s)]
*  people who came over here legally went through the process who are the most [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=203.18s)]
*  frustrated with the open borders and all of us no matter what our color or race [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=207.5s)]
*  or background will be upset about the fact that terrorists are coming across [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=213.46s)]
*  the border and that this is a national security nightmare. So thank you so much [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y16RL2An4ts&t=218.42000000000002s)]
