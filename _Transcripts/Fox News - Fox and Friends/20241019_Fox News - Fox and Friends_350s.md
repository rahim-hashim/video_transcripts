# Volleyball team makes stunning decision against trans athlete: ‘Bigger than a win or loss’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw)
*  My question is how do you plan on addressing the transgender issue in women's sports? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=0.0s)]
*  We stop it. We stop it. We absolutely stop it. You can't have it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=5.0s)]
*  It's a man playing in the game. I mean physically from a muscular state, even if it was a little bit less, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=9.0s)]
*  maybe they do all sorts of tests and drugs and everything else. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=15.0s)]
*  How do you stop it? Do you go to the sports leagues? Do you go to the Olympic counties? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=18.0s)]
*  You just ban it. The president bans it. You just don't let it happen. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=22.0s)]
*  This comes as several women's volleyball players have forfeited or in turn to forfeit, intend to forfeit, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=27.0s)]
*  their match against San Jose State over a transgender player on the team. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=35.0s)]
*  That includes players at the University of Nevada where several GOP lawmakers went to show their support. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=39.0s)]
*  And the captain of that team, Sia Lalili, joins us now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=45.0s)]
*  Sia, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=48.0s)]
*  You guys, you guys plan to, from what I understand, you intend to forfeit the match against San Jose State. Tell us why. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=51.0s)]
*  Yes, we just want our rights to be upheld on the court and we believe that women deserve fair opportunity and it's just not right. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=60.0s)]
*  Many people have made this point. And by the way, San Jose State has an outside attacker, outside hitter, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=73.0s)]
*  who is a biological male. And several teams have forfeited matches against San Jose State now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=79.0s)]
*  Sia, there have been people that have made the point. This is the only thing you can do. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=84.0s)]
*  Refuse to participate if this is going to be the case. Was that the feeling inside the team there at Nevada? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=89.0s)]
*  Yes, we met together as a team and the vast majority of us voted that we didn't feel safe and we didn't think that it was right if we participated in that match. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=96.0s)]
*  Have you discussed this with, I'm curious, any other teams that have also decided, any other players from other teams who have made the same decisions? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=106.0s)]
*  After our Utah State match, some of their players contacted me and just thanked us for supporting them and standing in solidarity, as well as the Boise State team. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=116.0s)]
*  Yeah, both Boise State and I believe Wyoming have already forfeited matches against San Jose State and Utah State has said it will when that match comes up for them as well. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=129.0s)]
*  Here's a question. What has been the reaction for you on campus from other students, not necessarily on the volleyball team, but the campus community there at Nevada? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=139.0s)]
*  It's been pretty silent lately, which I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I just hope that they know that we're doing what we think is right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=149.0s)]
*  And if one of those students, say, again, not involved in the volleyball team, thought you guys were somehow, I don't know, I'm going to use some of the arguments we've heard, were somehow bigoted or making a bad decision, what would be your response to that student? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=159.0s)]
*  I would just respect their decision and hope that they can remain respectful to me and my teammates. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=174.0s)]
*  And what about the university? How have they responded to, as I understand this is a decision among you ladies on the volleyball team. What is the response of the University of Nevada? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=179.0s)]
*  At first the university decided not to support us and they would still hold the match. But there's now an understanding between us and them that when we choose not to participate in that match, there's no repercussions or consequences to come to me or any of my teammates. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=189.0s)]
*  Yeah, here's the response. By the way, we have a statement from the University of Nevada. They said, University and its athletic programs are governed by the Nevada Constitution and Nevada law, which strictly protect equality of rights under the law. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=206.0s)]
*  The university intends to move forward with the match as scheduled. So they're saying the match will go forward as scheduled, but you're here telling us today the players will not play in that match. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=218.0s)]
*  No, we will not. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=230.0s)]
*  All right. And what do you hope changes as a result of you ladies forfeiting this match to San Jose State? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=232.0s)]
*  I hope it opens the eyes of not only the NCAA, but our conference, the Mountain West, that we're standing up for something and we hope that they hear them. They hear our faults. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=240.0s)]
*  OK, one last question for you, Cia. I think when other female athletes who've been confronted with this situation choose a different path than you, there's probably one of three reasons. One, they support the idea of transgender athletes invading women's sports. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=253.0s)]
*  Two, they're scared. Clearly, you're not scared, right? They're scared of the fallout. They're scared of the repercussions. Or three, they're afraid of the impact on their own competitive experience, meaning, well, I trained all this time. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=268.0s)]
*  I want to swim. I trained all this time. I want to run. Are you and your teammates concerned if you forfeit this match? It hurts you in the long run in reaching the Mountain West Conference finals or whatever it may be. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=282.0s)]
*  Are you concerned about the impact of what that means for your career? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=295.0s)]
*  I think that me and my teammates have gone over the fact that this is running a big risk for us. I mean, our one goal as a team is to win a Mountain West Championship and by forfeiting a game that puts that at risk, which is our main goal. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=302.0s)]
*  So of course, there's repercussions in that sense, but we all know that it's something that we want to stand for and it's bigger than just a win and loss. It's women's sports and the future of it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=316.0s)]
*  Right. I think that's the operative point. It's bigger than one forfeit, maybe even one Mountain West Conference championship. And we appreciate you sharing that sacrifice you and your teammates are willing to make with us here this morning on Fox and Friends. Thank you, Sia. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=327.0s)]
*  Thank you, Sia. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39VHDmawtw&t=345.0s)]
