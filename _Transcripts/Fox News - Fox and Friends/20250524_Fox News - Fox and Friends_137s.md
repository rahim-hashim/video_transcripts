*  Chaleigh Painter is here with the shocking details. Hey Chaleigh. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbEHea52FRs&t=11.9s)]
*  Hey Charlie, Rachel and Griff. So it all started after a 28 year old bloodied and bruised tourist broke out of a townhouse here in New York Friday morning [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbEHea52FRs&t=15.5s)]
*  Running to a nearby traffic officer for help after he said he'd been held captive for weeks. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbEHea52FRs&t=24.9s)]
*  According to sources to the New York Post, the victim arrived May 6th and went to the home rented by crypto entrepreneur named John Woltz. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbEHea52FRs&t=30.3s)]
*  The two apparently had passed business dealings according to police sources. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbEHea52FRs&t=39.1s)]
*  But once inside the home, a group allegedly tied up the victim with electrical cords and tortured him for days, including forcing him to take drugs, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbEHea52FRs&t=42.8s)]

*  He didn't look distressed at all, but that could have been just because he was on the street. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbEHea52FRs&t=90.2s)]
*  I just can't believe that like stuff like this would happen in 2025 in New York, you know, of all places. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbEHea52FRs&t=94.0s)]
