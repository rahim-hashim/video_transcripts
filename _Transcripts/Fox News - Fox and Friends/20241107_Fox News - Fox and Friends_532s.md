# ‘NO RESPECT’: Philly DNC lashes out at Harris campaign for botching race
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w)
*  Post-election political drama played out in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as the matchup between incumbent Senator Bob Casey and Republican Dave McCormick is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=0.0s)]
*  Still as you can see right there too close to call. Meanwhile all new this morning the Philly DNC [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=8.76s)]
*  Chairman is torching the Harris campaign. Let me just say this McCormick won. He's Casey's in denial [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=14.24s)]
*  There is no path to winning Bryan Yennis is live in Philadelphia Bryan [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=20.16s)]
*  Good morning guys the Democratic blame game in infighting here in Pennsylvania is heating up after Vice President Kamala Harris turned out [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=25.32s)]
*  Fewer votes in Philadelphia as of now with 99% of the vote counted then President Biden and former Secretary Hillary Clinton [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=32.92s)]
*  We spoke to Philadelphia's Democratic Party Chair Bob Brady who blames the Harris campaign [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=40.68s)]
*  The national campaign nothing zero they had no respect they have no coordination [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=47.68s)]
*  They didn't they didn't talk I never even had a conversation with the lady [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=52.68s)]
*  They didn't even do the right thing as far as giving us the resources that we need and they want to blame us and now I understand [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=55.68s)]
*  Somebody ever came was blaming Joe Biden. Can you imagine blaming Joe Biden for her loss? She lost he didn't lose [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=61.68s)]
*  Based on your experience in Philadelphia. Do you think that it is indicative of how this campaign was run? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=68.68s)]
*  Nationwide it kind of seems that way don't it I mentioned our collar counties. They didn't do any they didn't give them any respect [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=75.68s)]
*  They were they were screaming hollering for signs. They didn't get him to the last minute [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=81.68s)]
*  While the Harris campaign lashing out releasing a photo of Brady standing next to Harris and Tim Walls [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=87.68s)]
*  And then they said in part quote the Pennsylvania for Harris team knocked more than two million doors in the weekend leading up to election day [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=94.68s)]
*  Which is two million more doors than Bob Brady's organization can claim to have knocked during his entire tenure as party chairman [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=102.68s)]
*  Brady says the Harris campaign gave them about half the resources that they need and relied way too heavily on outsiders [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=110.68s)]
*  These people coming from other parts of the country they don't relate they got a clipboard [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=119.68s)]
*  They're not gonna do a drop of the children take off. They don't say house mom. How's your dad? How's your kids doing? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=123.68s)]
*  How's your son? You know, that's the more important the human touch when yet when you have your committee people doing that in the neighbors where they live in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=127.68s)]
*  Meantime we're watching Pennsylvania's Senate race, which is still too close to call Republican Dave McCormick leading incumbent Democratic Senator Bob Casey [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=135.68s)]
*  By less than half a point about 30,000 votes at this rate an automatic recount does hit according to Commonwealth law here in Pennsylvania [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=143.68s)]
*  When it is fewer than half a point, but the McCormick camp says look they have this in the bag [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=152.68s)]
*  They don't think there's enough votes out there for Casey to make up that margin guys. So what's the next step? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=157.68s)]
*  Brian who's gonna who's gonna push Casey to take a reality check? Do you know? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=163.68s)]
*  Yeah, well, I don't know look the Casey campaign says that there are enough provisional ballots out there and I don't know [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=170.68s)]
*  I mean at this point they're gonna hold on here the recount if it happens it has to happen. I think by the third week [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=177.68s)]
*  Three weeks from now and we'll see but McCormick remember McCormick and Oz had a recount in their primary a few years ago [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=183.68s)]
*  And that's what total maybe moved a couple dozen votes. So yeah, all right [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=190.68s)]
*  But the key is it's the provisional votes which have not yet been counted and that could tip it one way or the other [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=194.68s)]
*  All right, Brian. Thank you very much Brian earlier. You mentioned Bernie Sanders. He took to X yesterday to essentially [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=200.68s)]
*  Blow up the Democratic Party and he said among other things it should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party by the way [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=206.68s)]
*  He is not a Democrat. He's an independent which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=213.68s)]
*  First it was the white working class now, it's a Latino and black workers as well [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=220.68s)]
*  Well the Democratic leadership defends the status quo the American people are angry and want change and they are right and you know what? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=225.38s)]
*  Bernie Sanders is actually right on that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=233.16s)]
*  Of course [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=235.16s)]
*  He's right and I feel like we moved too fast when it came to the Philly guy because he had a couple points that he said [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=235.68s)]
*  We invited all these outsiders out here to a central be a relatable to average day working people [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=241.36s)]
*  No one respects it no one cares what this and there's this new talking point that I keep hearing on TV say well the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=248.4s)]
*  College educated people voted for a common excuse me [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=254.4s)]
*  So you're speaking down to vote because you have a degree [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=257.98s)]
*  By the way that you want all of us to pay for now the people that didn't go to college for you think that you're smarter [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=260.88s)]
*  That did not work. So what I love they love the term they use uneducated. It's not on it. Yes, it is high school [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=266.64s)]
*  There in their house ironing [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=275.04s)]
*  Educated was wrong with you [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=279.36s)]
*  Black voters so it's doubled 2024 and then Latino support in 2020 was 35% now. It's up to 41% [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  So Trump is telling the Republican Party. This is what I'm leaving you now [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=288.24s)]
*  You spend the next four years continuing to show you care. Don't you show up in four years or two years? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=292.36s)]
*  I also thought it was interesting that Joe Manchin a centrist or Democrats are really gonna miss is was trying to say this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  For the last four years. He wasn't trying to give Joe Biden a hard time [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=304.04s)]
*  He's trying to say wouldn't you're jamming down everyone's throat with your new Green Deal wouldn't fly and the rescue package wasn't needed [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=308.0s)]
*  And he has left the party. He wouldn't be Jim Justice [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=314.6s)]
*  Anyway, here's what he said that he should he thinks his party should take away from this devastating loss [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=318.12s)]
*  Donald Trump [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=325.56s)]
*  Didn't win just with the MAGA. He won with the centrist of the common sense the independence in the middle [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=327.2s)]
*  He was able to have a program that basically more people bought in and what Kamala did [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  That's the middle the power of the middle is unbelievable. I just hope when they get to Washington [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=338.20000000000005s)]
*  They remember how they got there. They got there by appealing to reasonable responsible sensible people that are in the middle [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=342.08000000000004s)]
*  That's right [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=350.04s)]
*  And we saw from the Fox News voter analysis that where we talked to 110,000 people coast to coast [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=350.72s)]
*  throughout the process there were only there were [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=357.08000000000004s)]
*  Less than 10% of people this time who identified as independence [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=360.4s)]
*  Ultimately people are all dug in what's interesting and as you look at as we wait for what happens in Pennsylvania [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=365.88s)]
*  13 Democratic senator candidates outperformed Kamala Harris for instance in Ohio [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=373.08s)]
*  Sherrod Brown lost to Bernie Moreno by four points, right? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  But Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump by 11 [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=382.64s)]
*  So people like their local people their statewide people more than the candidate did y'all see the clips of the view yesterday [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=385.96s)]
*  My word they still don't get it. I only heard one comment about how maybe we need to take a step back and think about [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=395.47999999999996s)]
*  Middle America. What does middle America really want? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=401.52s)]
*  I hope there's some selfish Democrats that say I'm not gonna go with this [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=403.67999999999995s)]
*  I'm gonna fight Trump every step of the way and just say okay [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  We lost the house and it looks like we didn't flip the house [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=408.91999999999996s)]
*  We flipped the Senate the Senate got flipped on us and you got the White House an overwhelming victory and I watched [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=412.28s)]
*  Congressman Himes yesterday [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  He said we used to say Donald Trump didn't win the popular vote [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=419.29999999999995s)]
*  He's not Trump barely Donald Trump lost the house and lost the Senate. We called him a loser [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=422.53999999999996s)]
*  Maybe that was but that's not what is and I couldn't believe it [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=428.0s)]
*  Anderson Cooper just sat there like everything he said I can't even what you know what I heard [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=431.4s)]
*  So we have to think about where we can work together [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=435.64s)]
*  I heard a lot yesterday the reason he won is because we were better off under him [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=437.68s)]
*  How can we vote for her when we know we're gonna get the same that we've had the last four years [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=443.15999999999997s)]
*  It's that simple and I was you were talking about the view. I mean some of the commentary about [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=448.08s)]
*  They rejected a black woman. Are you are you kidding? Yeah, a lot of this can you imagine? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=453.32s)]
*  Joe Biden got more of the black vote than she did. There was not this deep-seated [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  Hatred I shouldn't every single group. I should not play the outsharping clip because you lose your mind and Joe Scarborough yesterday [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=464.48s)]
*  Well, you know Chuck Schumer actually took the right tone and the tone was okay. We've talked about this before [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=471.72s)]
*  We are no longer in the majority, but we need to work together [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=477.24s)]
*  Hopefully Donald Trump needs people to work together. I mean can you imagine pinch me pinch me right now? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=481.56s)]
*  Okay, that was a little too hard. I wish I believe that's wrong. That's a guy that lost [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=488.44s)]
*  And that's a guy that's the same guy that was going to we had bipartisan [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=493.96000000000004s)]
*  immigration reform and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=498.36s)]
*  But now he's lost we send him to Washington to get something done, let's hope they do it without [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVzGeOM181w&t=501.76s)]
