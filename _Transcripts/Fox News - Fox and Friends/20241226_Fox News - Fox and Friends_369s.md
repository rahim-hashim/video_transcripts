# Government is 'hiding the truth' on mysterious drones, former defense official claims
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk)
*  Welcome back. As unexplained drones leave millions on edge across the country, one former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=0.0s)]
*  defense official recently issued this warning about the government's secrecy around UFOs. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=5.44s)]
*  Excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  and the public, all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos. If we approach [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=18.38s)]
*  the UAP topic in the same way as Americans have met other challenges, we can restore [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=23.48s)]
*  our faith in our government institutions. I believe that we as Americans can handle [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=29.259999999999998s)]
*  the truth, and I also believe the world deserves the truth. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=33.34s)]
*  Fox News contributor and former special operations intel analyst and drone expert Brett Velikovits [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=37.18s)]
*  joins us now. Brett, thanks for your service. Thanks for joining us. We listen to that, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=45.46s)]
*  and he's talking about extraterrestrial, but we really don't have to go outside of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=51.3s)]
*  our stratosphere to see our government being very secretive and not very trustworthy. I'm [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=54.98s)]
*  looking at the timeline here on these drones, and you have Majorcus at DHS briefing and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=59.779999999999994s)]
*  saying no big deal. You have Admiral Kirby saying it. These are people who lie to our [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=64.62s)]
*  faces about the border and about the Chinese spy balloon. If that's the credibility and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=69.1s)]
*  you're saying there's nothing to worry about here, that makes me think there's something [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=73.58s)]
*  to worry about here. Yeah, that's the issue is they've destroyed [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=76.82s)]
*  with the American people. And look, I want to believe there's some other form of life out there, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=81.14s)]
*  just like the rest of us. And I do have a real curiosity about what's up on our stars, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=85.7s)]
*  but I'm also pragmatic about it and realistic. And to say there's some alleged secret government [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=89.62s)]
*  group that for decades has been covering up evidence of aliens and hiding UFOs in their [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=95.06s)]
*  possession seems a little farfetched to me. I just frankly, I don't think the current government [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=99.22s)]
*  is smart enough to do that. But, you know, and then these sources are always some whistleblowers [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=102.9s)]
*  allegedly too afraid to come forward. What would be the incentive of that? And also, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=106.98s)]
*  you know, why does no one ever seem to be able to show me clear photos of these UFOs? And that was [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=110.42s)]
*  one of the issues with these recent drone sightings is the more people across the country [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=115.54s)]
*  who sent me photos of these drones, the more I started to understand many things in the sky are [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=119.62s)]
*  being misidentified. People are finally starting to look up. They're wondering what's up there now [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=123.78s)]
*  and they're seeing a lot of things that they don't recognize. And it's not their fault. The [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=128.34s)]
*  problem is our government hasn't done a good job protecting us from modern day threats by explaining [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=131.46s)]
*  what is regularly above us and what threats we're going to face at home sooner than later. And [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=135.78s)]
*  Joey, the rapid innovation right now of lethal drone technology over the years due to ongoing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=140.42s)]
*  wars overseas has forever changed the ways wars are going to be fought. In Ukraine, for instance, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=145.86s)]
*  an estimated 70 to 80 percent of the daily attacks that take place on the front lines are conducted [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=150.74s)]
*  with drones. You've got even North Korean soldiers who have entered the fight recently been taken out [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=156.18s)]
*  left and right by these kamikaze handheld drones. And frankly, we're just we're not ready for this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=160.34s)]
*  Our military is not prepared for that style of fight. We put too much money in the wrong thing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=165.22s)]
*  And there's just a lot of arrogance on our current government administration that thinks they've got [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=170.26s)]
*  it all figured out. But we're never going to fight another war without drones. And our adversaries, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=174.34s)]
*  they surely get it. I mean, there was a Chinese defense contractor who just signed an agreement [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=179.14s)]
*  for over one million handheld kamikaze drones to be produced for the Chinese government before 2026. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=183.06s)]
*  That scale of production doesn't exist in the U.S. They get it. But our government's not [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=189.78s)]
*  prioritizing it. Yeah, I've done a lot of coverage here, different shows on Fox about drones, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=195.22s)]
*  because I have friends in that industry coming from the EOD world. And it is it is the absolute [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=200.66s)]
*  arms race of the future. You talk about us spending money. We spend all this money on the F-35. And, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=205.54s)]
*  you know, you can do that with a with a Wal-Mart drone now. You can you can implement something [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=209.78s)]
*  that easy. But when we take a step back and look at what's happening, we're kind of honed in on [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=214.66s)]
*  New Jersey. But the lead up to this, I think, created a lot of the hysteria you had. I think [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=219.14s)]
*  the first thing reported on were drones going near military bases overseas. Then you have a [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=223.54s)]
*  Chinese citizen being caught trying to get back to China after flying a drone near a military base. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=227.7s)]
*  Then you start to have this happening in the Northeast. And I guess my question to you is, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=233.38s)]
*  my kind of take on this is a lot of it is coming from people actually finally looking up and paying [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  attention. But is there within all of this a layer of there is something specific going on [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=243.06s)]
*  that we need answers on? We definitely need answers. And look, the recent drone sightings [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=248.74s)]
*  just frankly showed how vulnerable we are as a nation and that we are no longer in control of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=254.10000000000002s)]
*  our airspace. And the government's lack of adequate response just made matters worse. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=258.82s)]
*  And but I understand why they were like that, frankly, it's because they were caught off guard [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=263.22s)]
*  that how little they even knew themselves, because we don't have the systems in place at the federal [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=267.7s)]
*  and state levels to monitor, identify, disrupt these rogue drone threats. And my concern is our [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=271.54s)]
*  government's just going to wait until somebody dies to do anything. And that's not acceptable. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=276.34s)]
*  That's because the US doesn't have a clear government wide policy on how to deal with [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=280.5s)]
*  unauthorized drone incursions. It's a national security threat. All the agencies like to say [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=285.14s)]
*  it's someone else's issue. But we know where the bottleneck is as the drone community. It's the FBI's [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=289.46s)]
*  drone department. It's the FAA's UAS office. These are the two most important offices for domestic [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=294.58s)]
*  drone defense. Yet they don't even know how to properly mitigate these threats. And they [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=300.34s)]
*  definitely don't possess the widespread technology across the US to stop it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=304.58s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people say 9-11 happened because government agencies didn't talk to each other. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=308.5s)]
*  Let's pray that's not the problem here. But you're an expert and you're getting in on this. You're [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=312.34s)]
*  part of a Fox Nation special, Close Encounters of the Drone Kind. It's streaming now. Let's listen. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=316.41999999999996s)]
*  One theory that got some traction was that the US government had dispatched the drones, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=324.58s)]
*  or perhaps a Pentagon training exercise for the US military. I find it hard to believe that there's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=330.18s)]
*  some super secret project in the works, especially because I used to work on a lot of these projects. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=336.5s)]
*  I used to test our own military's defenses with drone technology. Yeah, I'm excited for that. You [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=342.58000000000004s)]
*  can watch Close Encounters of the Drone Kind now on Fox Nation. I'm going to watch it today. Brett, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=349.54s)]
*  thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for your expertise. Thanks, brother. Appreciate it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5SPFv79RHk&t=354.18s)]
