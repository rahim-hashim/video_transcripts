# Israeli military announces temporary pause in fighting to allow Gaza evacuations
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4)
*  Hey, we've got a Fox News alert right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=0.0s)]
*  The IDF in Israel is temporarily pausing what they're referring to as military activities [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=3.56s)]
*  in Gaza City so that some civilians can actually evacuate. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=9.56s)]
*  And earlier this hour, Washington announced a third round of sanctions against Hamas-affiliated [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=13.72s)]
*  individuals. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=18.92s)]
*  And by the way, we're seeing video of Israel bringing incubators into that hospital in Gaza. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=19.92s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live in southern Israel. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=26.6s)]
*  Trey. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Hey guys, good morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=30.4s)]
*  We understand the Israelis are taking what they're referring to as tactical pauses today [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  to allow some more civilians to get out of the line of fire. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=36.1s)]
*  I do want to show you behind me here there are some excavators near the northern part [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=43.4s)]
*  You can hear a little bit of that small arms fire in the distance as the battles are going [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=44.64s)]
*  on. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=48.28s)]
*  The Israelis are working to destroy the tunnel network of Hamas, trying to target as many [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=49.28s)]
*  of those entrances as possible to make sure their forces are not ambushed as they operate [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=52.9s)]
*  inside Gaza. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=57.28s)]
*  The Israelis say 47 of their soldiers have died since the ground operation began two [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  and a half weeks ago. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=62.6s)]
*  Now, as these battles are taking place, much of the focus remains on the Al-Shifa hospital [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=63.6s)]
*  in Gaza City. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=67.92s)]
*  It is the Strip's largest. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=68.92s)]
*  UN officials say dozens of premature babies, kidney patients, and other vulnerable Palestinians [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=70.56s)]
*  are currently sheltering there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=75.36s)]
*  Overnight, the Israelis said they are preparing to deliver incubators to the Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=76.84s)]
*  They've been going back and forth as these battles are taking place in the streets of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=81.6s)]
*  Gaza City, working to support those infantry troops. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=85.28s)]
*  You can hear that outgoing artillery fire in the distance, a very active scene here [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=88.24s)]
*  along the southern front. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=91.84s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=93.08s)]
*  Hey, Trey, I've got a question for you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=94.08s)]
*  If they're taking these pauses so civilians can get out, how do they know they're actual [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=96.04s)]
*  civilians and not Hamas? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=105.2s)]
*  The Israelis are maintaining a distance from these evacuation corridors over concern that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=106.2s)]
*  Hamas could fire on their soldiers. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=111.36s)]
*  They also, interestingly, are going on loudspeakers and speaking in Hebrew to the evacuating Palestinians [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=113.68s)]
*  because they want to see if there are any of those hostages among the group. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=120.36s)]
*  Guys? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=124.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=125.0s)]
*  Thank you, Trey. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=126.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, moments ago, more than 400 U.S. officials from 40 departments, including the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=127.0s)]
*  White House, State Department, and the Department of Justice, signed a letter protesting against [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=131.76s)]
*  Joe Biden's Israel policy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=137.1s)]
*  They write, quote, we call on President Biden to urgently demand a ceasefire and to call [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=138.8s)]
*  for de-escalation of the current conflict by securing the immediate release of the Israeli [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=143.32s)]
*  hostages and arbitrarily detained Palestinians and the passage of adequate humanitarian aid [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=147.68s)]
*  to the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=153.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, 52 U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria have been attacked by Iranian militias. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=154.44s)]
*  Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall joins us now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=159.24s)]
*  Benji, so great to see you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=161.84s)]
*  You're looking good, man. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=164.08s)]
*  The forces that have been attacked there, some of them are special operators, some of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=166.64s)]
*  the guys that rescued you, they've been getting TBI traumatic brain injuries there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=171.44s)]
*  What's your reaction and what can you tell us from some of the soldiers that are in those [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=176.32s)]
*  bases that are experiencing right now, how it's impacted them? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=181.12s)]
*  Yeah, I've been out there quite a lot and I spent time on both sides with some of the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=184.44s)]
*  U.S. troops out there as well as near some of the Iranian-backed militias as well. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=188.12s)]
*  So I get both sides and 50 injuries now, over 50 injuries amongst American soldiers up there. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=192.24s)]
*  And I think the big question is what does the response mean? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=198.16s)]
*  You know, we've seen a few strikes on some of those sheer militia areas, but nothing [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=200.28s)]
*  in particular. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=206.24s)]
*  And I was speaking to Vice President Pence just before this and he was looking back and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=207.24s)]
*  saying, you know, we went in, we took out Soleimani when there was a big issue. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=209.56s)]
*  When there was gas used in Syria, we sent dozens of cruise missiles. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=213.32s)]
*  That sends a message to Iran. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=216.64s)]
*  That holds them back. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=218.22s)]
*  Taken out, a couple of guys in their little desert camps isn't going to hurt Iran. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=220.02s)]
*  Iran doesn't miss them at all. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=224.32s)]
*  We've hit back four times since we hit them on Sunday. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=225.56s)]
*  So they're saying bring it on. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=230.24s)]
*  We have to put a message of deterrence. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=232.68s)]
*  The administration feels differently. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=235.68s)]
*  They're afraid of escalation. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=237.52s)]
*  And they've made it very clear as well. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  So what message does that send to the Iranians? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=240.96s)]
*  We aren't going to do more because we're afraid of escalating it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=243.08s)]
*  And it has given Iran the carte blanche to continue doing what it's doing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=245.36s)]
*  You know, if it loses some of those guys, it just sends more. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=248.08s)]
*  It doesn't feel it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=250.24s)]
*  And you are seeing Iran in so many different places right now and they're not being stopped [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=251.24s)]
*  in any way. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=254.64s)]
*  You know, Hamas, Hezbollah supporting Russia. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=255.64s)]
*  Oil prices rising, which helps Iran. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  Iran is behind so many things and nothing's being done to stop them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=261.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=264.0s)]
*  I mean, what type of a message does this send to world leaders? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=265.0s)]
*  They've attacked us 52 times, our bases, since October 17th. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=267.28s)]
*  We've struck back only a couple of times. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=271.2s)]
*  I think the world leaders is really interesting because I think we're starting to see a bit [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  of a pull in some Western countries. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  The full-on support for Israel seems to be dropping back slightly. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=278.64s)]
*  And I wonder whether in the coming weeks we're going to see that change a little bit in [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=281.96s)]
*  growing calls for ceasefires. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=284.56s)]
*  And how about the fact that as we were introducing you, the news that there are a number of people [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  in the administration, staff members, who are have signed a letter at the DOJ State [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  Department, even at the White House saying, hey, Joe Biden, we shouldn't be behind Israel. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=296.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=300.72s)]
*  I mean, 400. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=301.72s)]
*  There was another letter written a few days ago by 100 State Department employees as well, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=302.72s)]
*  basically saying that the administration is wrong on its policy towards Israel, saying [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=306.92s)]
*  the guy who, a junior diplomat who wrote the first letter, had come out previously and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=311.6s)]
*  said that Israel was committing genocide against Gaza. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  And these are people who are working within the State Department. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=317.44s)]
*  And that's where we're going to start seeing this pull and push. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=320.0s)]
*  That's why Secretary of State Pompeo said at times he seemed like pretty isolated. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  And he was Secretary of State. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=326.32s)]
*  Within the State Department is another culture who want to run a different country than they're in. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=328.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=332.32s)]
*  It just feels that the State Department is, of course, out in the field. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=333.32s)]
*  And they're talking to the Qataris and they're trying to do things on diplomatic fronts. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=336.36s)]
*  But there hasn't been any progress as a result. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=339.52s)]
*  And so the question is, is that enough? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=342.2s)]
*  And what else needs to be done? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=344.0s)]
*  And I will point out that on the other side, you have all the Arab leaders meeting over [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  the weekend and they're making big pushes. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=348.88s)]
*  And you had MBS, Mohammed bin Salman meeting with the president of Iran, with Assad, who [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=351.0s)]
*  killed 250,000 of his own people. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=356.23999999999995s)]
*  You know, Erdogan, who hurts the Kurds, Sisi, who won't allow any Ghazans into Egypt. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=358.35999999999996s)]
*  And you ask the question, what are those world leaders doing? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=364.23999999999995s)]
*  And where is the U.S. influence on those countries? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=367.0s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  Benjamin, thank you very much. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttpu0VAqVF4&t=372.28000000000003s)]
