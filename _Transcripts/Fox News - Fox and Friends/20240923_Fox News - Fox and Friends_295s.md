# Bombshell letter revealed from Trump assassination suspect
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50)
*  This is a Fox News alert. In about two hours, the suspect in the second assassination attempt [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=0.0s)]
*  against former President Donald Trump will be back in federal court where a judge will [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=8.1s)]
*  determine whether he can be released on bail. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=12.06s)]
*  Brooke Singman has brand new reporting that has come out in the last half hour about the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=14.92s)]
*  suspect's movements and a note he wrote long before the attempt. Brooke? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=19.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's right guys. So Ryan Ruth will appear in a West Palm Beach courtroom today [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=24.76s)]
*  at 11 a.m. Eastern Time. This is the DOJ releases this letter from Ruth where he says quote, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  this was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Now this letter came from a civilian [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=34.56s)]
*  that contacted police after they say Ruth dropped off a box at their house several months [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=39.56s)]
*  prior to the attempt. After learning of the incident, the witness opened this box and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=44.76s)]
*  found ammunition with the letter that also says he will offer $150,000 to whoever can [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=49.2s)]
*  quote, complete the job if he failed. The DOJ also saying Ruth had six cell phones [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=55.84s)]
*  and two license plates and his internet history revealed he looked up Trump locations into [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  October and had to travel from Palm Beach to Mexico. Last week he was charged with possession [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=67.28s)]
*  of a firearm by convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=73.04s)]
*  The charges came after a Secret Service agent noticed what appeared to be a rifle poking [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=78.48s)]
*  out of a chain link fence at former President Trump's Florida golf course while Trump was [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=82.9s)]
*  golfing. The Secret Service agent fired in that direction of the rifle. A witness spotted [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=87.22s)]
*  Ruth then fleeing from the area and he was arrested shortly after. Now the two charges [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=92.26s)]
*  carry a combined maximum sentence of 20 years in prison but federal prosecutors say stronger [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=96.92s)]
*  charges could be coming. Meanwhile, the House has unanimously passed a bill to enhance Secret [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=102.34s)]
*  Service protection for presidential candidates and that bill is now heading to the Senate. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=107.4s)]
*  Brooke, thank you very much. There's so many questions. No kidding. So months ago Ruth drops [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  off at somebody's house a box and the person didn't open it until Ruth popped up in the news. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=118.62s)]
*  So obviously this is just pure conjecture but obviously it seems like, just like in the movies, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  dropped the box off and said hey if anything happens to me open the box and in the box ammo, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=131.18s)]
*  a metal pipe, building materials, tools, four phones, various letters. What's interesting is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=137.34s)]
*  it sounds like he had no intentions of being killed by return fire because they were trying, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=142.78s)]
*  he was trying to figure out how to get to Mexico. The plates on the Nissan not registered actually [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=151.5s)]
*  that car so he had a bunch of extra plates. He had a two additional license plate. He had six [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=157.82s)]
*  cell phones and all. He had 12 pairs of gloves. What's questionable though is in this letter it [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=164.22s)]
*  says this was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you. I tried my best, gave it [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=169.66s)]
*  all my gumption that I could muster. So does that mean he's tried in the past or was he talking [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=174.46s)]
*  about this latest one? I also think based on this letter, can we stop saying we don't know the motive? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=179.66s)]
*  I mean it's pretty clear in the letter what his motive and why he decided to do this and who was [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=186.46s)]
*  the intended target. I'm so sick of these press conferences where they come out for instance, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=192.3s)]
*  we don't know yet. We don't know his motivations. We don't know why he decides to do that. He [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=197.10000000000002s)]
*  spelled it out is what we would call in the legal field or criminal justice field as his manifesto. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  This is the manifesto. He even tells the person if he can't finish it, someone else, he asked [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=206.86s)]
*  someone else to finish it and then he was going to give him I think 150,000 dollars. So this is a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=212.62s)]
*  manifesto. We know the motive and that we should stop saying we don't know. They'll have to prove [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=217.5s)]
*  that he actually wrote this letter, that this was actually Ruth and what attempt is he talking [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=221.34s)]
*  about? Is there another one that he tried and he failed? And also today the judge is going to decide [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=226.86s)]
*  if he can be released on bail. We interviewed Jonathan Turley. He said I doubt it. He probably [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=231.18s)]
*  will hold him but he's being held for having a gun even as a felon which is illegal and then taking [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=235.5s)]
*  off the serial number of the gun but not charged yet with anything with any stricter laws like [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=241.34s)]
*  trying to assassinate a president or trying to assassinate a secret service officer. So the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=248.38s)]
*  attorney general for the state of Florida, she has said that they are expecting more charges against [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=253.82s)]
*  him. At the very least it shows premeditation. It shows that he had a plan and so let's see where [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=260.3s)]
*  they go with it because now it's in the the ball is in the fed's court to figure out the new charges [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=267.1s)]
*  but clearly even on those two charges, gun charges that he's being held on, he could wind up in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=272.46s)]
*  prison for over 20 years. Yeah for just those two charges. If these other charges are added, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=278.3s)]
*  could be for life. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilme. And I'm Ainsley Earhart and click here [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVj2k0oaf50&t=283.58s)]
