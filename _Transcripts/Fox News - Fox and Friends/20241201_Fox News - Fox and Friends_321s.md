# Former Democratic congressman: 'We need to get things done'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0)
*  Senator John Fetterman has some advice for his own party about why they lost male voters to Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=0.0s)]
*  The Pennsylvania Democrat telling the New York Times quote, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  In 2016 I was doing an event with steelworkers across the street where I was live, where I live, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=8.32s)]
*  and it was clear that at the time people were voting for Trump. And the Democrats response was, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=13.84s)]
*  aren't they smart enough to realize they're voting against their interest? It's condescending. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=19.04s)]
*  If anything, that reinforces the kind of stereotype telling them that I know better than you do, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=23.44s)]
*  and that's not helpful. Former Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania, Patrick Murphy, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  joins us now. My friend, I won't put up with any of his shenanigans, by the way, either, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  this morning. But in true sincerity and curiosity, Patrick, Fetterman I do think is pointing to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=37.6s)]
*  something that's a weakness within the Democratic party. There is a tone of condescension towards [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  those with whom they disagree. And in this case, it seemed to target an entire demographic, young men. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=52.4s)]
*  Yeah, and the Democrats, as you mentioned that article, we lost the Democratic vote and the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=59.52s)]
*  working class vote. I was at a holiday party for Thanksgiving with my buddies. Most of my friends [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=65.12s)]
*  I grew up in Northeast Fuluffe with, none of them went to college. And so I had police [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  lieutenant Keith Christie yesterday say, hey, Patrick, what happened to the Democrats? He said, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=75.76s)]
*  fight for us. And I'm talking to these folks. And then I'm like, Senator Fetterman's right, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=79.84s)]
*  he's onto something. You can't talk down to people. You got to meet them where they are. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  And when you spend so much time on things like student loan, over $100 million on that, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=88.56s)]
*  and it's just when you look at that, and most Americans don't go to college, there's a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  disconnect. And that's why, frankly, we lose that type of vote. You know, it's a great point on the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  student loan forgiveness in the blue collar workers as well. But I do wonder, I think this, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=107.68s)]
*  Patrick, Democrats fashion themselves. They believe they are the smarter contingency [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=115.84s)]
*  among the political parties. They believe they are the more intellectual. And because of that, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=121.76s)]
*  they, which I think is incorrect, but they because they believe that to be the case, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=126.48s)]
*  there's a looking down your nose. There is a that tone is going to be a real hurdle [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=130.16s)]
*  to attracting people to your party. Yeah, listen, I don't necessarily agree with that premise. I do [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=135.52s)]
*  think there are some Democrats that do look down and just like there's some Republicans that look [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=142.32s)]
*  down on working class people. Right. And that's the divide in our country. And that's why I think [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  when you have people like Senator Fetterman and other people who are trying to unite Americans [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=150.88s)]
*  and are trying to bring people together and do it and meeting them where they are, I think that's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=154.4s)]
*  what we keep missing. And you got to just talk to people and let them know what you're doing for [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=158.4s)]
*  them. You know, it's what's going to affect their pocketbook. You know, inflation was a big deal. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=163.6s)]
*  Right. And it was going down. But you got to talk about, you know, what you're doing that's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=167.44s)]
*  going to make their lives better. It's going to make your pockets better. It's going to put more [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=172.0s)]
*  food on the table at a cheaper price. And I think the Democrats have better policies, but they're [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=175.44s)]
*  not conveying that to the American people. And that's why, you know, they lost the Senate. They [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=180.4s)]
*  lost their White House and they still don't control that. So far, so far, their their their strategy [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=185.44s)]
*  seems to be let's triple down on trans issues or whatever it may be identity politics. And I don't [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=191.6s)]
*  know if this is a path forward. See what you think. There are rumors, speculation, running rampant [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=196.16s)]
*  that AOC could be a candidate for president in twenty twenty eight. Here's a list, by the way, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  of people who've been mentioned as potential twenty twenty eight leaders of the Democrats. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=207.28s)]
*  But the new one there is AOC. Listen, I will. I love you. I drives me crazy when people already [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=212.56s)]
*  talk about four years from now. Right. Like, let's get stuff done now. Let's you know, let's figure [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  out and be honest reflection on what we need to do better as a country and meet people where they [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  are, as I mentioned, but also get stuff done. And on that list is people like Governor Josh [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=232.16s)]
*  Pirro here in Pennsylvania. He gets things done. People appreciate that. And, you know, he does it [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  in a bipartisan way. He doesn't have control of the state Senate. He gets things passed because [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  he puts our Pennsylvania families first. And I think that's what people are hungry for. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=246.32s)]
*  But they don't want to be talking about four years from now. You know, we don't even have the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=251.68s)]
*  cabinet and we don't have the new members of the congress in yet. And people are tired of the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=255.76s)]
*  politics. But I get it. Well, like, you know, like people, they can't help themselves. Right. But [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  it's not just that. I got it. It's not just that. It's that your party is in the wilderness right [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=265.76s)]
*  now looking for an identity moving forward, trying to figure out how to talk to people [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=270.08s)]
*  and seeing who will be brainstorming, who could be the visionary or the leader of that movement. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=274.24s)]
*  And I'll just take you and we'll leave it here. I'll take you. What you said, you got to get [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  things done. And what you just said is AOC is really good at saying things, at articulating, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=282.56s)]
*  communicating a vision, which may or may not be your party's moving forward. We'll find out. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  Like you said, we do have four years to figure that out. But I would say that governors like [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=293.2s)]
*  Shapiro might have a better track record of getting things done. And we'll see if that [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  continues over the next four years. Patrick Murphy, very few shenanigans. I appreciate that this [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=302.56s)]
*  morning. Good to see you, Patrick. Thanks, Bill. Appreciate your time. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz5m5htoD_0&t=307.2s)]
