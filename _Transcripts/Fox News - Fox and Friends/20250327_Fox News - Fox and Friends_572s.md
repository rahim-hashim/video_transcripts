*  Drugs or you know those kinds of things himself [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=236.88s)]

*  We're waiting for the actual criminal complaint. Hopefully gonna find out some of those details here [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=247.16s)]
*  But even some of the agents that were on the scene [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=251.56s)]
*  Were remarking just his age the fact that he is 24 years old and he's considered the top [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=254.88s)]
*  MS 13 person on the entire East Coast of the United States [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=260.6s)]
*  And David so you were there at like a staging area a safe distance away from the apartment complex where this guy was [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=264.44s)]
*  because [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=273.56s)]
*  Apparently, you know, it wasn't a bunch of guys and windbreakers going in everybody was armored up [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=275.20000000000005s)]
*  They came in in armored vehicles. There were SWAT teams. It's because they were expecting. Oh, yeah, there could be trouble, right? Oh [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely, they expected a fight there were weapons in the house. We were told we saw multiple different SWAT vehicles [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=286.8s)]
*  I mean it almost looked like something you would see at an army base [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=294.12s)]
*  I mean there was a heavy heavy presence for this and the FBI director attorney general myself and others really other top DOJ [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=297.2s)]
*  leadership the deputy attorney general Todd Blanch [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=308.76s)]
*  Amiel Bovay the principal associate deputy attorney general also on scene watching [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=309.8s)]
*  From a distance, but they could watch it live on monitors and see and the technology [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=314.96s)]
*  We weren't allowed to show it on camera because of the nature of law enforcement [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=319.56s)]
*  But it was incredible to see I mean very very clear pictures and high-tech stuff and they've been [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=323.2s)]
*  You know surveilling this person for a while you were talking about how law enforcement [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  They do this every single day raised raids every single day, which is true [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=332.88s)]
*  But it is unusual to get someone this high up on the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  List on the food chain. I mean you got intelligence gathered. This is a massive operation [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  It is a big one and they've been looking after this person for a while [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=351.88s)]
*  It's not clear how many times they previously wanted to do this operation, but it happened to work out today [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  But we know that there was surveillance on this individual for a while [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=360.24s)]
*  And again just the neighborhood that this person lived in was a run-of-the-mill residential neighborhood [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=363.36s)]
*  People with Easter decorations outside it was an apartment complex [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=368.52s)]
*  very nice neighborhood and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=372.59999999999997s)]
*  You know they go in with these big tanks and and SWAT teams this morning and get this guy out of there [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=375.12s)]
*  And I'm sure those residents are thinking what the heck is going on here and now and everybody knows [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=381.68s)]
*  There was a raid in Virginia David that took place between March 1st and March 13th and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=385.47999999999996s)]
*  214 [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  Illegal immigrants were apprehended took place in Virginia [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  So I'm wondering if somebody that was arrested between that time period talked and told [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=396.0s)]
*  The the FBI about this guy where he is in his location [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=403.32s)]
*  When you were on the ground and talking to people that were involved in this arrest did anybody say anything about that? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=407.24s)]
*  No, they didn't they didn't bring that specifically up, but you're right that did happen recently in Virginia [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=417.20000000000005s)]
*  There's been a task force at the FBI [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=421.52000000000004s)]
*  In Virginia there's been a task force that the FBI has set up here in Virginia [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=423.64s)]
*  So that's something new and we expect the director the FBI director to talk about that along with the AG [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=427.84s)]
*  Attorney General we call it the AG [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=432.64s)]
*  Today here at this news conference [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=434.84s)]
*  But yes, there there definitely has been a heightened increase work here in Virginia on this and David [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=436.52s)]
*  While you were talking and reporting of the president posted on truth social this truth [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=442.47999999999996s)]

*  Tweeted out top MS leader arrested in Virginia [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=458.88s)]
*  This is what happens when you have competent federal leadership working with state and local law enforcement on the ground Bravo AG [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=461.76s)]
*  Pam bondi cash Patel governor Glenn Youngkin and Tom Homan. So there's a list of people real quickly [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=467.2s)]
*  I know the press conference is supposed to happen in about five or six minutes. Do we know who's gonna be there? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=472.44s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=478.56s)]
*  Yeah, we know it's gonna be the FBI director cash Patel [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=479.79999999999995s)]

*  That's all we're aware of now [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=486.2s)]
*  Obviously some other officials with the local field offices at the FBI and whatnot will be there [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=487.26s)]
*  But they're definitely happier that they have this person in custody now and again [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=492.2s)]
*  It's a little strange that I can't say this person's name [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=496.64s)]
*  But we've been told we can't say this person's name as per the way things work in the court system [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=499.32s)]
*  They need to wait for an initial appearance [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=503.79999999999995s)]
*  But we know it's a 24 year old man from El Salvador the the top leader of MS 13 on the East Coast and one of three [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=505.44s)]

*  It is because of the massive [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=529.36s)]
*  Maximum pressure of this administration whether you're talking about the border with the military there border patrol their record hirings now [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42jrCWGjnT4&t=531.36s)]
