# Karoline Leavitt: Think about how insane this is
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g)
*  Let's bring in the White House Press Secretary, Kellyanne Levitt, right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=0.0s)]
*  We saw some of your posts. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=3.2s)]
*  Mr. Press Secretary, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=5.36s)]
*  The coordination was really noteworthy to see that. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=7.76s)]
*  I never remember seeing Christopher Wray out and about at a crime location. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=10.28s)]
*  Could you bring us behind the scenes? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=14.94s)]
*  How long this has been in the works? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=17.2s)]
*  What could you add to what we just heard? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=19.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=21.52s)]
*  First of all, I want to commend President Trump and our great Attorney General, Pam [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=22.6s)]
*  Bondi, our FBI Director, Cash Patel, and Tom Homan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=27.24s)]
*  This is what happens when you have competent federal leadership at the top, working with [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  state and local law enforcement on the ground to put bad guys in jail. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  And this is a directive that has come from President Trump here at the White House to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=42.22s)]
*  law enforcement agencies across the country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=45.92s)]
*  This president has your back and he is going to support you as you pursue illegal immigrants [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=49.06s)]
*  and you pursue violent criminals in American communities. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=55.04s)]
*  This individual who they arrested today was a national ringleader of the brutal MS-13 [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=58.64s)]
*  gang, a gang that the previous administration, Joe Biden and his cabinet and his team allowed [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=64.48s)]
*  to infiltrate in our country. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=71.0s)]
*  And now President Trump and his team are cleaning up that mess by arresting these individuals. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=73.04s)]
*  And this took place 30 miles outside of Washington, D.C., where you have politicians and mainstream [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=77.92s)]
*  media journalists who live in this city and who have derailed against the president in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  his crackdown on illegal immigration and on violent crime. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=88.8s)]
*  They should be grateful that monsters like this are no longer going to be living in their [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  communities thanks to the great leadership of President Trump and everybody who was on [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  the ground. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=101.76s)]
*  They were working throughout the night, no sleep for this team, to make the lives of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=102.76s)]
*  the American people safer. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=107.88s)]
*  Caroline, I think it's important to note, too, with this big operation, there were no [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  leaks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=113.0s)]
*  I mean, that's incredible that there was no leaks in there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=114.0s)]
*  But also, the point was made that the flights will continue. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=116.6s)]
*  And this guy was in the country illegally, I think from El Salvador. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  Can we anticipate him being loaded up on a plane real soon? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  We are going to continue with the mass deportation campaign that President Trump promised the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=130.56s)]
*  American public. I understand that a radical judge at the appeals court has denied the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=135.48s)]
*  president and our legal team in the case against the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=141.2s)]
*  But we are going to continue to forge ahead in the courts. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  And think about how insane it is that we have a Democrat Party and we have Democrat activists [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  who are judges in our judicial branch who are fighting against this administration from [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  deporting these heinous individuals. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=160.76s)]
*  If we have a country where the president of the United States, where the commander in [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=162.92s)]
*  chief cannot deport foreign terrorists and illegal aliens, the American people are in a lot [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=167.12s)]
*  of trouble. So we're going to continue to fight to do what's right for law abiding [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=172.12s)]
*  American citizens. We will forge ahead in that court case. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  But yes, we will comply with the court's orders. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=179.52s)]
*  We will fight in court. But we are going to continue to deport illegal immigrants from [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=182.0s)]
*  the interior of our country. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=187.0s)]
*  You know, Caroline, one of the things about Donald Trump is before he was president, he [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=188.8s)]
*  was on TV a lot and he was a great, you know, a great presenter and he was a really good [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  producer as well. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=198.0s)]
*  And it seems like this entire administration so far has been really good at getting the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=199.44s)]
*  images out, the optics of what is going on. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=205.32s)]
*  We saw early on some of the raids. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=208.88s)]
*  We saw Kristi Noem yesterday in El Salvador. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=210.92s)]
*  We're seeing this going on. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=213.68s)]
*  Ultimately, the the visual message, the optical message to the people who are thinking [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=215.72s)]
*  about coming into the country is, why bother? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=221.72s)]
*  They're going to catch me. I'm going to wind up on a plane or in that hellhole in El [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=224.52s)]
*  Salvador. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=228.52s)]
*  That's right. The president has made it very clear to people around the world. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=230.12s)]
*  Do not come to the United States illegally. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  And if you do, you will face consequences for that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=237.6s)]
*  And not only are we taking action on the ground, we are sending a strong message with [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=240.72s)]
*  these visuals to the rest of the world. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=245.8s)]
*  And it's having an impact. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=247.72s)]
*  Look at illegal migration through the Darien Gap. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=249.28s)]
*  There has been a 99 percent decrease. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=251.68s)]
*  Look at the gotaways at our southern border. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=254.84s)]
*  Seventy seven a day. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=256.96s)]
*  That's an astronomical decrease from the previous administration. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=258.68s)]
*  There were thousands of people coming to the border every single day under the previous [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=262.4s)]
*  administration. And it just proves that everybody who said we needed a border bill was [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=267.48s)]
*  wrong. We just needed a president who actually wanted to enforce our nation's immigration [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=272.12s)]
*  costs. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=275.92s)]
*  Caroline, we only have a minute left, but right now we know the pattern. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=275.96s)]
*  They're going to pound you on the signal story all day. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=279.08s)]
*  How do you how do you handle that? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=282.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, there's so many other things to talk about. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=284.35999999999996s)]
*  The president and our entire team have been incredibly transparent. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=287.2s)]
*  We have taken every question under the sun about this story. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=290.32s)]
*  And the national security adviser has taken responsibility for this mistake. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=293.56s)]
*  We are looking into it to ensure it can never happen again. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=297.88s)]
*  And we're going to continue doing the business of the American people that they elected [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  President Trump to do, which includes removing illegal criminals from our communities, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=304.6s)]
*  which includes America first trade policies. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=308.8s)]
*  Yesterday, the president announced a 25 percent tariff on foreign auto vehicles and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=311.16s)]
*  auto parts. This is huge for our auto industry. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=316.6s)]
*  In fact, the United Auto Workers Union, Sean Fain, the president came out this morning [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=320.08s)]
*  and applauded the president for this exceptional policy. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=324.88s)]
*  More jobs, more investments, more money coming back to America. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=328.32s)]
*  We are going to continue to focus on that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=331.92s)]
*  Well, today is definitely a big win for the administration and the country. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=333.44s)]
*  That's right. A dirt bag off the street that was criminalizing and harming other [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  Americans. Caroline Levitt, we appreciate you a lot. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=342.32s)]
*  Thanks, guys. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV4FzZ5tg8g&t=344.91999999999996s)]
