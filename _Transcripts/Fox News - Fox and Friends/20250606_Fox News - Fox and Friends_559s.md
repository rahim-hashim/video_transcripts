# Trump, Musk to speak on phone after EXPLOSIVE online feud: Report
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI)
*  So a big beautiful truce could be coming today as President Trump and Elon Musk will reportedly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=0.0s)]
*  speak over the phone to hash out their differences that spilled over into the public. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=7.4s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson is live in Washington with all the details for us. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=12.96s)]
*  Hey Lucas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=16.04s)]
*  Well good morning Ainsley, good morning guys. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=17.04s)]
*  Peace talks are in the offering today after President Trump and Elon Musk appeared headed [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=18.92s)]
*  for divorce after a bitter feud over ex yesterday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=22.78s)]
*  The first shots were fired in the Oval Office. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=26.32s)]
*  Elon and I had a great relationship. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=29.76s)]
*  I don't know if we're well anymore, but I'm very disappointed in Elon. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=32.36s)]
*  I've helped Elon a lot. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=37.28s)]
*  And I'll be honest, I think he misses the place. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=38.28s)]
*  I think he got out there and all of a sudden he wasn't in this beautiful Oval Office. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=40.96s)]
*  White House aides rushed to schedule a call today with the world's richest man to broker [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=45.44s)]
*  a peace deal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=49.44s)]
*  Both Trump and Musk were textually active Thursday afternoon, hurling invectives at one another. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=50.84s)]
*  Here's Trump posting, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=55.96s)]
*  Elon was wearing thin. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=57.68s)]
*  I asked him to leave. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=59.0s)]
*  I took away his EV mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=60.0s)]
*  that he knew for months I was going to do. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  And he just went crazy. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=66.84s)]
*  Musk responding, without me, Trump would have lost the election. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=68.84s)]
*  Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=72.32s)]
*  Musk threatened to scrap his spacecraft used to ferry astronauts into orbit, saying, in [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=77.12s)]
*  light of the president's statement about cancellation of my government contracts, SpaceX will begin [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=81.24s)]
*  decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=86.2s)]
*  And later Musk walked it back. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=89.72s)]
*  OK, we won't decommission Dragon. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=91.64s)]
*  Here's Elon at 310. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=94.04s)]
*  Time to drop the really big bomb. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=95.84s)]
*  Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=97.92s)]
*  That is the real reason they have not been made public. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  Have a nice day, DJT. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=103.36s)]
*  Many Democrats pounced. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=105.36s)]
*  This divorce was predictable, if not inevitable, because it was always a marriage of convenience. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=108.64s)]
*  The Dems, we've been dumping all over Musk and vandalizing Teslas or whatever, and now [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=115.84s)]
*  suddenly now we might be more back into him. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  The roots of the feud are over Trump's big, beautiful bill. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=123.68s)]
*  Musk says it adds trillions to the debt. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=127.04s)]
*  Republicans say it includes nearly two trillion in savings. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=129.56s)]
*  I've had a lot of love and respect for you for what you've done for this country over [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=133.24s)]
*  the last several months, but you've lost your damn mind. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=138.08s)]
*  I've tried very hard to speak with Elon over and over, you know, and talk with him about [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=142.28s)]
*  what I believe are misconceptions he has about this bill and what it is. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=146.4s)]
*  There are no plans for President Trump to launch airstrikes against Tesla dealerships [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=150.6s)]
*  nationwide, something you can perhaps confirm with our defense secretary later in the show, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=154.52s)]
*  guys. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  Right, so Lucas, you're shooting down the rumors that we're going to have airstrikes [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  on Teslas. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=163.56s)]
*  You're shooting this down? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=164.56s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=166.0s)]
*  OK, thank you very much. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=167.0s)]
*  I just want to underline that for people at home. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=168.0s)]
*  Ted Cruz was on with Sean last night and he said it's unfortunate, both are extraordinary [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=170.32s)]
*  men. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=174.2s)]
*  He said Elon is just this incredible businessman. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=175.2s)]
*  You have Donald Trump, who's a phenomenal leader. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=177.16s)]
*  He works daily. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=179.72s)]
*  He's pulled our country back from the abyss. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=180.72s)]
*  He said both are great leaders and when they work together, it's better for our country. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=182.96s)]
*  Caroline Levitt said, Elon can speak for his companies as a businessman, but President [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=186.16s)]
*  Trump has the responsibility to fight for our country. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=190.68s)]
*  I am a little too optimistic, but they're both alpha males. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=194.56s)]
*  They fight. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=200.32s)]
*  It's dirty. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=201.32s)]
*  I got a friend like this. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=202.32s)]
*  I love him to death, but when we fight, it is, I don't know what gets over us. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=203.32s)]
*  We don't do it publicly, but we love each other and it comes, here's the reality though. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=207.6s)]
*  There's nowhere else to go in this breakup. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=212.6s)]
*  It's not like Elon can suddenly become a Democrat or join some other party. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=215.04s)]
*  We're in a binary system. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=219.24s)]
*  He is our George Soros on the right and Donald Trump is the Barack Obama of the party. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=220.96s)]
*  There is no split. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=227.0s)]
*  I think the call, based on my sources that I've talked to, is going to happen today. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=228.36s)]
*  They're going to bury the hatchet. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=232.68s)]
*  We wish this would have not happened publicly and happened privately, but you've got two [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  strong alpha males that are deep in their convictions and it just exploded online. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=243.68s)]
*  A couple of things. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=244.68s)]
*  It looks like foundationally, it looks like maybe Musk wanted to stay. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=245.68s)]
*  It would have been longer in some different capacity. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=248.84s)]
*  Number two is he wanted a different person at NASA head and to me, it would have been [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=250.72s)]
*  an easy thing to do. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=254.56s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you're Democrat or Republican, but the guy that he wanted has a Democratic [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=255.56s)]
*  roots and Trump's at this point, I can't have anybody inside the tent that wants to potentially [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=259.36s)]
*  could stab me in the back, but I think when Bill Ackman came out and said, I support Trump [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=264.52s)]
*  and Musk and they should have peace that would benefit our great country and Musk comes back [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=268.52s)]
*  and says, you're not wrong and I get the sense that things calm down. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=273.08s)]
*  The Epstein file thing was way over the top and just crazy to say that Trump was in the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=277.68s)]
*  Epstein files. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, what are you doing? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, sometimes when people get drunk, they do crazy things, but this is a total escalation [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=285.76000000000005s)]
*  and I give by Elon Musk, but I give Trump so much credit for the most part, he's measured, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=294.0s)]
*  wants to be here, appreciate what he did. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  EV mandate was eliminated. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=301.8s)]
*  He's not happy about it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=303.72s)]
*  He says foundationally he doesn't like the bill. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=305.32s)]
*  You know what? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=308.64s)]
*  The bill might actually get better because of Musk and I think we're working towards [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=309.64s)]
*  that right now. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=312.84s)]
*  Elon Musk, and I know it sounds crazy, he just doesn't understand politics. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=313.84s)]
*  He has no idea about compromise. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=317.24s)]
*  He doesn't understand that Donald Trump has to make Mike Lola happy in New York and he's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=319.04s)]
*  got to make every Congress, every conservative congressman in Texas happy and he's got to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=325.44s)]
*  an orchestra where the bassoon is having a fight with the oboe and the trumpets don't [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=332.08s)]
*  like the saxophone. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  All Trump has to do is get the song done and what Musk does is says, if I don't agree with [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=337.96s)]
*  the saxophone and the oboe, I don't want to play. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=342.64s)]
*  Donald Trump is a businessman. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  That was Donald Trump is a businessman and he's also a, he has this ability to understand [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=347.0s)]
*  politics. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=353.64s)]
*  So he has both. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=354.64s)]
*  Elon's a businessman. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=355.64s)]
*  He's used to just firing you if you're not doing a good job. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=356.91999999999996s)]
*  We saw that with Doge. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=359.88s)]
*  There's, there's, it's, he's black or white. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=361.48s)]
*  You know, there's no gray in the middle and it's just like a relationship. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=364.24s)]
*  Everyone's been in a relationship where in the very beginning, you're crazy about each [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=368.32s)]
*  other. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=372.12s)]
*  You're talking marriage. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=373.12s)]
*  You're talking about meeting the family and then all of a sudden it takes a turn and you [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=374.12s)]
*  don't like each other anymore. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  It's like what me and you always talk about sometimes. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=379.44s)]
*  Us men, we can be sensitive sometimes. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=382.04s)]
*  We just want to add a boy. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=384.24s)]
*  We just want to, good job. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=385.74s)]
*  Just a good job. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=387.64s)]
*  Just some words of affirmation. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=389.4s)]
*  Give it to him. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=392.0s)]
*  He did. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=393.0s)]
*  He did. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=394.0s)]
*  But Elon was upset about some certain issues and he felt kind of pushed to the side. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=395.0s)]
*  You mean issues, Stephen, that I brought up? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=400.52s)]
*  Correct. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=402.2s)]
*  He was a little upset with how the bill was going, some other issues behind the scenes [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=403.2s)]
*  and he just wanted to feel back in the fold. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=407.97999999999996s)]
*  We get like that sensitive sometimes. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  We don't expect it to be public, but it is what it is. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=413.06s)]
*  Here's a montage of the past relationship. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=416.92s)]
*  The bromance. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=418.84000000000003s)]
*  The good moments. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  We're honored to be joined tonight by one of the people who is going to help us build [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  this incredible future and he is a truly incredible guy. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=427.24s)]
*  His name is Elon Musk. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=431.56s)]
*  President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=433.96000000000004s)]
*  He must win to preserve democracy in America. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=437.64s)]
*  We have a new star. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=440.92s)]
*  A star is born. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  Elon. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=444.56s)]
*  You know, he likes this place. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=447.56s)]
*  I can't get him out of here. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=448.56s)]
*  He just likes this place. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=449.56s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=450.56s)]
*  I like having him here too. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=452.76s)]
*  He's good. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  Elon is doing a great job. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  He's finding tremendous fraud and corruption and waste. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=457.68s)]
*  Elon Musk said today, I love Donald Trump as much as a straight man can love another [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=460.44s)]
*  man. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=466.36s)]
*  What does the first lady think about that? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=467.36s)]
*  Oh, I think she'll be okay with it somehow. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=469.76s)]
*  If you read and believe the media, he's become one of your best friends. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=472.92s)]
*  He's working for free for you. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=475.76s)]
*  Well, I love the president. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=477.03999999999996s)]
*  I just want to be clear about that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  I think President Trump is a good man. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  I love Tesla. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=481.56s)]
*  I look forward to continuing to be a friend and advisor to the president. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=482.56s)]
*  I just like to add this. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=486.76s)]
*  The problem between two men, two powerful men, one of the richest, one of the most powerful, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=488.36s)]
*  is that Elon Musk doesn't have popularity. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=492.48s)]
*  He doesn't have a constituency. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=494.24s)]
*  And what he did is he's got relevance and he's got power. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=496.44s)]
*  So if he wants to spin off, it is not like a popular politician or businessman will spin [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=499.84s)]
*  off, you know, let's say maybe like a Jamie Dimon. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=505.48s)]
*  They go, wow, he's got all this popularity. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=507.96s)]
*  Elon Musk has turned a lot of people off because of his genius and his boldness. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=509.84s)]
*  Now, the most insincere thing ever is the Democrats. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=513.84s)]
*  The Democrats made him worse than Trump. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=518.32s)]
*  He's not going back. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=520.6s)]
*  And now they're all of a sudden praising him. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=521.6s)]
*  He can't go there and they don't want him. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=523.26s)]
*  So again, they are just like the KGB story, just like the Jay Tapper book. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=525.68s)]
*  The Democrats go, what do I do with this? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=530.24s)]
*  What do I do with this? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=532.96s)]
*  They try to take every opportunity and they feel like they can just bury the hatchet [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=533.96s)]
*  and somehow they can change the narrative. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=539.08s)]
*  I don't think that's going to happen in this situation. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=541.72s)]
*  You set all his cars on fire. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=543.72s)]
*  You've been asking people to boycott his company. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tZkGjiewrI&t=546.0400000000001s)]
