# Kevin O’Leary to anti-Israel protestors: This will come back to haunt you
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk)
*  Anarchy on college campuses continuing through the weekend with student activists pushing their pro-Hamas sentiments. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=0.0s)]
*  And now Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary is sounding off with a word of caution for those agitators. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=8.0s)]
*  O'Leary warning that student protesters are trashing their job chances, adding that when it comes to their futures, they are screwed. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=15.0s)]
*  Shark Tank investor and O'Leary Ventures Chair, Kevin O'Leary is here with us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=24.0s)]
*  Kevin, thanks for being here. Why are they screwed? Is it because, I mean, a lot of them are wearing masks. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=28.0s)]
*  They're trying to hide their identity. Do you think that'll work? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=34.0s)]
*  It used to work back in the 60s and 70s because it was only recorded on 16 millimeter film. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=37.0s)]
*  Today, all of this video security cameras are at 1080p and 4K resolution. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=44.0s)]
*  Extremely high resolution that allows you to use AI protocols to identify people by the iris or just a partial exposure of the face. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=51.0s)]
*  Do you ever wonder how they captured every single person that marched on the hill in the insurgents? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=61.0s)]
*  Now, whether they arrested or not didn't matter, but every single individual on that hill eventually was identified using this AI technology today. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=67.0s)]
*  It's very available. It's inexpensive. And I use it as an employer every time we have a candidate in the executive suite. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=75.0s)]
*  We do a deep dive and we find out where you came. We're looking for what you say on your resume matching your reality of your life. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=81.0s)]
*  And obviously, I don't care what side you're on in the protest, but if you're fighting police, burning flags, wrecking properties, breaking through windows, I'm going to know that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=89.0s)]
*  And so is the government. So is everybody else. So think about that. That's all I'm telling these young people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=100.0s)]
*  Think about it because it's not free. Do you think they're thinking about it or or or do they think this will pay off? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=104.0s)]
*  I mean, everything in their incentive structure, Kevin, in academia says become an activist, agitate. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=110.0s)]
*  That's what their universities are telling them to do. Wouldn't they want their best opportunities in mind? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=116.0s)]
*  Well, universities and the concept of tenor for professors is allowing people with different thoughts and ideas to flourish. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=122.0s)]
*  That's what our institutions are all about. But I'm just going back to a simple fact. When you break the law of the land, you become a criminal. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=130.0s)]
*  And if you think by putting a mask on or wearing sunglasses is going to protect you, it doesn't. That's all I'm telling you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=139.0s)]
*  And so, you know, I think when you're in your 20s, you're very passionate and I get that and everybody goes through that process. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=146.0s)]
*  But think about it. Think about what happens next in 10 years. Why didn't you get that job? Why didn't you get on that board? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=152.0s)]
*  Why can't you get a loan? I'm telling you why right now, because I saw you do it and you lied to me on your resume that you never broke the law. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=158.0s)]
*  Well, you did. Whether you get caught or not doesn't matter to me as an employer. That's why you should really think this through. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=167.0s)]
*  And I teach this in colleges now. The world has changed because we have AI and we've got high resolution imagery and it's being captured every day. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=174.0s)]
*  And it goes on the dark web within 48 hours. I can see it any time I want. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=183.0s)]
*  You're right. It is a totally different game. And why wouldn't you, for your corporation, cover your back by getting all the information you can? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=188.0s)]
*  Kevin O'Leary, thank you for your time. Take care. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=195.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_HpMJgirk&t=204.0s)]
