# Swing state voters ERUPT for Trump: Democrats are 'ruining this country'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI)
*  Meanwhile, with less than 24 hours to the election, more than 4 million votes already [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=0.0s)]
*  cast in Swing State, Georgia. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=4.24s)]
*  That's more than half the voters in the state. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=6.8s)]
*  So what do voters are, what are they saying this morning? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Lawrence Jones is talking to them live at the Eggs Up Grill. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  It has been sold out since 4 a.m. in that battleground state. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=14.8s)]
*  Lawrence, let them loose. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=19.48s)]
*  I mean, it's like we're at a stadium. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=21.48s)]
*  This is the overflow room here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=24.48s)]
*  USA? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=27.48s)]
*  USA? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=28.96s)]
*  Let's talk with some folks. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=32.96s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=34.96s)]
*  So you already voted. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=35.96s)]
*  What was the main issue for you when you went to vote? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, the border is a big issue. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  And those people don't work and we're giving them money like crazy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=44.68s)]
*  And I've worked all my life. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  I'm nearly 72 years old. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=50.2s)]
*  Didn't even start drawing Social Security until I was 70. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  And you know, it's just ridiculous what the Democrats want to do. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=56.12s)]
*  They're ruining this country. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  A lot of people agree with him. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  I'm going to go to my friend right here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=65.6s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=67.6s)]
*  I'm Brittany Soles. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=68.6s)]
*  So Brittany, what was the main issue when you went to the polls? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=69.6s)]
*  The main issue was just the fear of people voting in a direction that's going to take [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=73.6s)]
*  our economy in the wrong direction. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=78.84s)]
*  My biggest priority is my family. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=82.56s)]
*  I have three children. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=85.08s)]
*  And if our economy doesn't change, it's going to be a hard candy Christmas this year. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=86.08s)]
*  It may not even be a Christmas. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=90.08s)]
*  That's true. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=92.08s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=93.08s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=94.08s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=95.08s)]
*  I want you all to meet my other friend here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=96.08s)]
*  Now, you have not voted, but you promised me that you're going to vote. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=99.08s)]
*  And so when you go tomorrow, are you undecided by the way? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=104.08s)]
*  No, I'm very decided. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=109.08s)]
*  And what got you to that decision? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=111.08s)]
*  I love America, and I love Trump, and I love Jesus Christ. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=113.56s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=116.56s)]
*  It's so easy, isn't it? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=117.56s)]
*  All right, let's go to the other room. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=118.56s)]
*  All right, now, we're going to try to go to the other room. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=120.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=124.56s)]
*  We got another room. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=127.56s)]
*  What's up, everybody? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=128.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=129.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=132.56s)]
*  I want you to meet my friend here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=137.56s)]
*  You were telling me that you're passionate. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=138.56s)]
*  What type of work do you do? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=140.56s)]
*  I'm an EKG technician at Admin Healthcare Redmond. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=142.04s)]
*  It's a great place to work. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=145.04s)]
*  With the economy that's going on, people can't afford to come to the hospital, pay for their [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=148.04s)]
*  bill, pay for their surgeries and everything. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=152.04s)]
*  So it's tough out there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=154.04s)]
*  So you were telling me earlier, it's not just the grocery store prices, but when people [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=156.04s)]
*  need healthcare, they can't even afford that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=160.04s)]
*  Yeah, no, they're having to choose between one or the other. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=162.04s)]
*  So the question is, who are you going to vote for now? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=164.04s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=166.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=167.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=168.04s)]
*  As you guys can see, in Rome, Georgia, we got a fired up crowd and we got more of it [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  after a quick break on Fox and Friends. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  So, Brian, let's actually go, let's go talk with some women because maybe they can give [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  us some insight to what's happening right here. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  I pointed you out earlier because I just knew you had some stuff to tell me. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  So they're saying this race is real tight here in Georgia. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  Who would have thought in Georgia it'd be tight here again? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  And the key demographic is women. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=199.0s)]
*  What are women telling you? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=201.0s)]
*  How do you feel about this election? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=203.0s)]
*  Oh, I feel like it's going to go towards Trump because the women are for Trump. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=205.0s)]
*  You know, we're middle class women. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=209.0s)]
*  We're the ones that have to buy the groceries, pay the bills, and we know what's going on. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=212.0s)]
*  So the question is, ma'am, I'm going to ask your friend next to you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=217.0s)]
*  So you got the grocery prices and then you got the abortion issue. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=221.0s)]
*  And they're targeting a lot of that abortion issue to women right now. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=224.48s)]
*  What matters more, that issue or the grocery prices? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=228.48s)]
*  Well, it's definitely the grocery prices. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=233.48s)]
*  I have a 32-year-old son that is barely making it buying groceries. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=235.48s)]
*  He pays his mortgage and that's it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=239.48s)]
*  Abortion is very, oh my goodness, it's heart-wrenching. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=241.48s)]
*  So it's, but it's just everything. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=244.48s)]
*  It's just everything. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=247.48s)]
*  And we need some happiness, you know. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=249.48s)]
*  We need Trump. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=251.48s)]
*  I'm back here agreeing. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  So I might as well get your thoughts on it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  You heard the marbles. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=256.96s)]
*  I heard the marbles. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=257.96s)]
*  Why is it so close here in Georgia? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=258.96s)]
*  It used to be a solid Republican state. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=260.96s)]
*  Y'all even got a Republican governor and you got two Democrats that are senators. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=262.96s)]
*  Why is it so close here? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=266.96s)]
*  What changed? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=268.96s)]
*  We had a lot of people come in through the Hollywood tax credits that changed the profile of Metro Atlanta. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=270.96s)]
*  We have a different voter in the Metro than we do out here in what I call real Georgia, God's country, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=278.44s)]
*  where we have lived here for a really long time and we know what our values are and we have turned out strongly [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=283.44s)]
*  over the last three weeks to vote for those values. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=289.44s)]
*  We don't want to be a border county. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=292.44s)]
*  Every county in Georgia is a border county when the buses roll in with illegal aliens. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=294.44s)]
*  So the big question to the crowd as we get a live look at everybody, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=299.44s)]
*  does Georgia go back to red or does it remain blue? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=303.44s)]
*  Okay, this is what the people are saying, guys. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=306.92s)]
*  I'll send it back to y'all. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=309.92s)]
*  All right, we're back here in Georgia. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=311.92s)]
*  It's a fired up crowd today. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=314.92s)]
*  So everyone always says that the next generation, we're in trouble. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=316.92s)]
*  I think it's different for these Gen Z voters. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=323.92s)]
*  So tell me as Gen Z voters, what is the top issue for y'all? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=325.92s)]
*  So for me, for someone who is about to graduate next year, for me it's the economy and immigration. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=329.92s)]
*  I have tons of friends who are still unemployed, who have not landed a job a year later after graduation. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  One of the things I'm concerned about is how much taxes am I going to be paying next year listed in the Democratic Plan? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, what am I going to be paying next year? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  What about you, sir? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  The same thing, economy and immigration. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  Immigration is a record high right now. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  Our economy is totally in the garbage. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  It's just everyone's living paycheck to paycheck no matter how much you make. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  And it's just crazy. It's absurd. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  Did you worry about buying your first house? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=364.88s)]
*  Oh, I'm really afraid that I'll never be able to buy a house if the economy keeps going the way it is. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=366.88s)]
*  Something has to change, right? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=371.88s)]
*  All right, let's talk with some more folks back here. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=373.88s)]
*  How y'all doing back here? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=375.88s)]
*  What's your name, ma'am? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=376.88s)]
*  Carolyn Stallworth. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=377.88s)]
*  So Carolyn, tell me, what's your number one issue? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=379.88s)]
*  Well, I have three. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=381.88s)]
*  Economy, immigration and health. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=383.88s)]
*  I am so glad that President Trump has added that to his key policies. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=386.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=393.36s)]
*  Being the age that I am, I was fortunate to be healthy until I was 75. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=394.36s)]
*  So I know personally what the young folk are going to be going through as they age. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=400.36s)]
*  And with food, synthetic foods, etc. being a major cause of our illnesses, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=408.36s)]
*  I am just ecstatic that President... [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=415.36s)]
*  President? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=418.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=419.36s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=420.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=421.36s)]
*  So you talked to your husband, right? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=422.84000000000003s)]
*  Is this your husband? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  I assumed that. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  I got it right, huh? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  So tell me, everybody's talking about black males and the record support for Donald Trump. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  Can you tell me why there is this explosion within our community? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, that would be a very difficult question for me to answer because I've been a Republican since 1962. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=436.84000000000003s)]
*  But one of, you know, my primary objectives are to get young people to the stage in life [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=445.32s)]
*  where they are willing to work for the things that they like to attain. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=458.32s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=462.32s)]
*  And the problem we have in today's environment, so much has been given to them based on tax dollars. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=463.32s)]
*  This is why our economy now is in the garbage can. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=470.32s)]
*  That's why we got so much inflation. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=473.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=474.8s)]
*  We got a massive crowd here. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=475.8s)]
*  We got the front row Joes here. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=477.8s)]
*  We're going to talk to them later, but we got a big show coming up on Fox & Friend live from Georgia. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=480.8s)]
*  We'll see you all in a bit. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=485.8s)]
*  Here we go! [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=495.8s)]
*  That's for Georgia! [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=496.8s)]
*  We got a big crowd here today. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  Are you all ready? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  It's crazy in here. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  This is a powerful state because Georgia was 12,000 votes and separated Joe Biden from Donald Trump. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=517.28s)]
*  And they say they're going to turn this state back red. Is that right? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=524.28s)]
*  So let's get to why. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=529.28s)]
*  So we were talking earlier. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=531.28s)]
*  You know exactly how the economy is affecting people day to day because you see it in your job, right? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=533.28s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=538.28s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=539.28s)]
*  Okay, so I'm in the auto industry. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=540.28s)]
*  Here I've been 10 years consecutive at one dealership. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=542.28s)]
*  A majority of our vehicles are trucks. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=545.28s)]
*  Trucks with the hindsight of the increase of doubling the gas has hindered people from buying trucks [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=548.28s)]
*  because of the fuel price of going near $3 a gallon from what it used to be, $1.30, $1.40 a gallon while Trump was in office. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=553.76s)]
*  And now we have the situation where people have to look at the payment, the insurance, and they'll look at the price of gas. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=560.76s)]
*  And now the price of gas exceeds the monthly payment with their paint on their truck. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=565.76s)]
*  And that's affecting everything. I know because my dad's a truck driver. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=569.76s)]
*  Let's bring this barber in right here. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=572.76s)]
*  You're a barber and you've been watching our Barber Shop series. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=574.76s)]
*  So you run into a lot of folks. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=579.24s)]
*  When you talk to them, when they're in your seat, what do they say is the number one issue facing the country? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=581.24s)]
*  The number one issue is the price of energy. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=585.24s)]
*  And people forget all the things that have happened in the past four years. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=588.24s)]
*  Who would have ever thought that $5 a gallon gas to go three hours to find baby formula. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=591.24s)]
*  That happened in this four year period. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=597.24s)]
*  We cannot have that again. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=599.24s)]
*  We have to turn that around. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=601.24s)]
*  And people forget all those little things that happened under Harrison Biden. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=603.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=606.24s)]
*  Turning the page. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=607.72s)]
*  Alright, let's talk with these folks. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=609.72s)]
*  Alright, I got them. Alright, man. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=611.72s)]
*  Tell me, what's your name? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=613.72s)]
*  My name is Lauren. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=615.72s)]
*  Lauren, so tell me what's the number one issue facing this country right now? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=616.72s)]
*  I think border security. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=619.72s)]
*  I have three young children and I want them to grow up in a safe place in the economy. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=621.72s)]
*  Why would someone in Georgia care about the border? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=627.72s)]
*  Because they are all coming in and they are being distributed to all the states. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=632.2s)]
*  So they're in our own backyard. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=637.2s)]
*  We know what happened in Athens. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=639.2s)]
*  And it makes me very sad. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=641.2s)]
*  That family still hasn't gotten a call from the President of the United States? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=643.2s)]
*  No. And no parent ever recovers. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=647.2s)]
*  It's unbelievable. Georgia, it's great to be here. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=649.2s)]
*  I'll send it back to you guys on the couch as I make my way to my seat. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpdK4bpm4qI&t=653.2s)]
