# Trudeau out as successor vows to fight Trump: 'Canada will win'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ)
*  All right, President Trump will reportedly meet with tech CEOs at the White House today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=0.0s)]
*  to discuss the tariffs as Canada gets ready to elect a new leader. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=4.2s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like they got one. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=8.08s)]
*  Mark Meredith is at the White House. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=9.4s)]
*  Mark. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Brian Ainsley and Lawrence, good morning, friends. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  The White House is facing growing questions from economists, business owners, even voters [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=13.88s)]
*  about the impact of tariffs on the economy here and abroad. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=18.12s)]
*  Today trade expected to be top of mind, and the president sits down with multiple tech [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=21.88s)]
*  CEOs. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=25.84s)]
*  Among those expected to be here today, the heads of IBM, Qualcomm, HP and Intel. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=26.84s)]
*  Overnight China officially imposed tariffs on many foreign products coming from the United [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=32.24s)]
*  States, the latest sign of a trade war growing larger by the day. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=36.44s)]
*  The president still insists his decision to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=40.28s)]
*  will pay off. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=44.96s)]
*  I think the tariffs are going to be the greatest thing we've ever done as a country. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=47.16s)]
*  It's going to make our country rich again. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=51.72s)]
*  We have many companies, as you know, auto companies are opening up plants now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=53.94s)]
*  We've had four or five announced already, but many more are coming and we're basically [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=58.58s)]
*  going to take back the money, a lot of the money that we've given away over many decades. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=63.5s)]
*  We've lost our jobs, we've lost our factories. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=68.7s)]
*  Meantime Canada has a new leader, Liberal Party members choosing Mark Carney as new prime [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=71.97999999999999s)]
*  minister. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=76.62s)]
*  He's vowed to stand up to Trump over past comments that Canada should join the United [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=77.62s)]
*  States as the 51st state. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=81.38s)]
*  America is not Canada. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=84.25999999999999s)]
*  And Canada never ever will be part of America in any way, shape or form. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=86.82s)]
*  So the Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade as in hockey, Canada will win. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=94.3s)]
*  Certainly a lot of attention to our neighbors in the North. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=105.62s)]
*  We'll be looking to see how President Trump may respond a little bit later on today. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=107.78s)]
*  It is a big change for Canada as Justin Trudeau had served as prime minister, guys, going [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=112.04s)]
*  back for nine years. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=116.0s)]
*  So a big change up North. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  Brian Ainsley and Lawrence? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  So Mark, this guy finishes out Trudeau's term, then they have an election, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=121.72s)]
*  Is that the way the parliamentary system works? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=127.9s)]
*  Well, and the Liberal Party is certainly feeling emboldened. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=129.76s)]
*  Obviously they decided to move past Trudeau, but they're feeling a little bit more emboldened [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=132.28s)]
*  after some of the back and forth with the United States. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=136.24s)]
*  But whether or not Carney's speech, like we just saw from Ottawa, would really kind of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=138.74s)]
*  rally his base there, or would it be something where it just kind of continues this back [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=141.86s)]
*  and forth with potential tariffs and trade that could create more problems for Canadians [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=146.14000000000001s)]
*  and Americans is what we have to watch. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=150.10000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=151.9s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=152.9s)]
*  He said that Canada will never be a part of America in any way, shape or form, because [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=153.9s)]
*  we've heard President Trump say it should be the 51st state. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  He used to call Trudeau Governor Trudeau. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=160.5s)]
*  But this guy, the Liberal guy, he received 86 percent of the votes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=164.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of tough talk going on. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=168.1s)]
*  But when it comes to the trading partnership, they really cannot survive without the United [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  States. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=177.78s)]
*  So the rhetoric is fine, I guess, if you want to rally your people. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=178.78s)]
*  But then you're going to have to tell them, help the people, or at least explain to the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=183.38s)]
*  people how they're going to overcome when they get hit with this massive tariff. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=187.38s)]
*  So the one thing is the tariffs are rocking the market. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=192.62s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=194.78s)]
*  Donald Trump, when he first took over, the stock market rallied in 2016, 5.7 percent [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=196.1s)]
*  by this point. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=201.38s)]
*  But because of the tariffs going back and forth and the lack of predictability, now [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=202.54s)]
*  it looks like they're on the negative growth side there since the inauguration. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=208.18s)]
*  The market's only up 1.6 percent after the initial rally. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=213.14s)]
*  So Obama was up, it was down 20 percent, but that was after the collapse of 28. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=216.68s)]
*  So it's getting some stability. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=221.22s)]
*  Whatever the president's going to do with tariffs, I think the up and down, the threating, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=223.9s)]
*  the pushing back of the barriers, the market hates it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=227.3s)]
*  And I just think that if we just pick a lane, whatever it is, we could deal with it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=230.86s)]
*  Because this overall approach, I think Americans get behind. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=235.34s)]
*  We don't manufacture things. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=238.58s)]
*  How do we bring it back? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  Make it economically profitable to come back here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=241.62s)]
*  Make these companies build here zero tariffs. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=244.78s)]
*  And if you've got to bring your company here, down to 15 percent corporate tax instead of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=247.42000000000002s)]
*  paying up in the 20s. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=251.70000000000002s)]
*  So make people want to build things here, like Conda, like that tech company from Taiwan, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=253.7s)]
*  the chip company from Taiwan. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=257.86s)]
*  That's the overall goal. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=259.86s)]
*  And you know who appreciates it? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=260.86s)]
*  One of Donald Trump's biggest critics. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=262.92s)]
*  He spoke at the DNC and how bad Donald Trump was. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=264.86s)]
*  But he is somebody who is pro-tariff because he sees the objective. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=268.21999999999997s)]
*  Listen to what he said on ABC's Sunday show. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=272.7s)]
*  It's simple for us. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=277.09999999999997s)]
*  Look, we're in a crisis mode in this country. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=278.34s)]
*  There is no single issue in this country that has affected our economy and working class [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=281.9s)]
*  people and their jobs than NAFTA, the USMCA, and our trade laws, our broken trade system. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=286.78s)]
*  And we're in a crisis mode. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=294.17999999999995s)]
*  And you know, we are triaging right now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=296.58s)]
*  So I hear this debate about blanket tariffs and all this stuff. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=299.5s)]
*  But look, we're in a triage situation. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=302.09999999999997s)]
*  Tariffs are an attempt to stop the bleeding from the hemorrhaging of jobs in America for [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=304.78s)]
*  the last 33 years. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=309.17999999999995s)]
*  Of course, it's pro-worker policy that the president is doing when it comes to the tariffs. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=311.38s)]
*  Look, I know the market is going crazy right now because of the uncertainty. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=315.65999999999997s)]
*  But I think you've got to let it roll with it for a second. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=320.7s)]
*  And the reason why I say you roll with it for a second is because we know what happened [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=322.94s)]
*  in the first administration that he had. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=326.58s)]
*  You had, when he passed the tariffs, when it came to inflation, was virtually at zero. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=329.21999999999997s)]
*  So I say give the president some latitude here. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=335.58s)]
*  I think the second thing, Ainsley, is they haven't passed the tax cuts yet. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=339.14000000000004s)]
*  I think if the American people had the tax cut with the tariff policy, there would be [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=343.82000000000005s)]
*  less franticness. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=348.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think the president has said there's going to be a transition period. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=349.74s)]
*  And it's going to be in the very beginning. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=353.26000000000005s)]
*  He said, I like to get things done in the very beginning, probably because he anticipates [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=354.5s)]
*  that it's going to take some time to bring business back to America. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=357.66s)]
*  And he's waiting on, you know, a few years into his administration to see the economy [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=361.22s)]
*  grow again. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=364.90000000000003s)]
*  And so he's just basically saying, give me some time to bring wealth back to America. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=366.14s)]
*  I know that they want to apply. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=369.97999999999996s)]
*  He's working with Elon to apply the business model, business management, to our federal [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=371.38s)]
*  government so that these companies will be, the government will be subservient to these [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=376.14s)]
*  companies instead of the other way around. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=382.06s)]
*  And so they have, there's a method to their madness. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=384.06s)]
*  And he's just saying, be patient with me. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=386.78s)]
*  So I agree with you. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=388.7s)]
*  I think... [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=389.7s)]
*  Give him some room. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=390.7s)]
*  I think there's two things. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=391.7s)]
*  The reason why the tariffs went on Mexico and Canada is fentanyl. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=393.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=397.65999999999997s)]
*  And that's because this is about drugs. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  So saving lives. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=400.46s)]
*  Mexico made some big improvements. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=401.46s)]
*  Mexico, Mexico made some huge improvements. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=403.65999999999997s)]
*  We've seen it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=406.53999999999996s)]
*  They also are playing a role in the lack of traffic at our southern border. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=407.53999999999996s)]
*  And then there's, they see some gains over with Canada too. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=411.21999999999997s)]
*  And then we get to the whole reciprocal tariff thing. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=414.41999999999996s)]

*  It's surprising that it wasn't already done. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=431.53999999999996s)]
*  These are supposed to be our partners, but they're not doing it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIIE-UMZeQ&t=433.82s)]
