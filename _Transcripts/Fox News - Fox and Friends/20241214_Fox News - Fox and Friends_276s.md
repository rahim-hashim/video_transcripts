# Democrat says party carries ‘stench of loser’ on them after election defeat
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4)
*  39 minutes after the hour now, welcome back to Fox and Friends. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=0.0s)]
*  As President-elect Trump prepares to return to the White House, it is clear that the tech [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=7.68s)]
*  industry is, you guessed it, they're preparing for it too. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=12.32s)]
*  Already Amazon plans to make a million dollar donation to Trump's inaugural fund ahead of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=16.68s)]
*  Jeff Bezos' visit to Mar-a-Lago next week. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=20.84s)]
*  Google's CEO is also reportedly meeting with Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=23.56s)]
*  Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman will be donating, you guessed it, a million dollars to Trump's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=28.64s)]
*  inaugural fund. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=34.68s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, Mark Zuckerberg's Metta announced that they're doing the very same. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=35.92s)]
*  So the question is, what's behind the shift? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=40.84s)]
*  Here to discuss is DNC National Finance Committee member Lindy Lee. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=44.28s)]
*  You know, it's interesting because I think a lot of people are saying they're trying [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=47.84s)]
*  to get ahead of what could be more regulatory restrictions on them, maybe a bit of a microscope [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=51.28s)]
*  What do you think is behind all this? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=58.84s)]
*  Kevin, it's great to be with you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=60.24s)]
*  I think, unfortunately, a Democratic party has a stench of loser written all over the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=62.08s)]
*  party and I'm sorry. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=66.16s)]
*  And I'm speaking as a Democrat myself, this brings me no joy to say it, but I feel like [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=67.16s)]
*  the Democrats are going to be consigned to the wilderness for at least the next four [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=71.12s)]
*  to eight years. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=74.36s)]
*  And Jeff Bezos is probably thanking his lucky stars that he withheld that endorsement. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=75.76s)]
*  And they're doing everything they can now to continue the detente. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=81.08s)]
*  Remember what Zuckerberg said on July 13th when in Butler, Pennsylvania, this assassination [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=84.56s)]
*  attempt, he praised President Trump for being a badass. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you about this idea of going out there and sort of kissing the ring. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=93.56s)]
*  You have Zuckerberg doing his thing, Bezos, and by the way, I was really surprised that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  he decided to stay out of the fray and not let the Post do that, but as it turns out, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=102.92s)]
*  it was a pretty shrewd move. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=107.64s)]
*  What do you expect will happen when they go there and they have these conversations? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=109.16s)]
*  I think they're going to solidify the relationship between the business world and President Trump. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  And right now, the economy is ailing under the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  People are just, they're suffering. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=123.56s)]
*  Yes, inflation has come down, but cumulative price hikes are still eating away at people's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=125.64s)]
*  pocketbooks and people are dying for a change. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=130.0s)]
*  So this is, I think we're about to embark on an entirely new era of prosperity. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=133.12s)]
*  I certainly hope so. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=138.12s)]
*  And yeah, you can just feel it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=139.88s)]
*  Even in the last couple weeks, Americans are celebrating that Trump's approval rating is [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  incredibly high. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=145.56s)]
*  People are in support of his transition. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=146.56s)]
*  The momentum is just tremendous. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=148.52s)]
*  And I'm speaking as a Democrat and I'm feeling it as well. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=152.36s)]
*  Also as a Democrat, you probably could acknowledge that the party seemed to have been given, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=153.36s)]
*  let's just say it for what it is, a bit of an edge, especially as it relates to Google. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=158.96s)]
*  The way that they manage their search engines, you're going to have their CEO go over there [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=163.44s)]
*  and basically try to state his case. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=168.12s)]
*  How concerned do you think that the tech giants might be of a Trump presidency moving forward? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=170.48s)]
*  Especially, I understand, if you're a Democrat, you're probably like, hey, great, we've gotten [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=177.68s)]
*  in sort of the brakes, as it were. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=181.28s)]
*  How concerned, though, should they be about a Trump presidency? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=183.92s)]
*  I think the tech world is loving the fact that Donald Trump's going to be the next president. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=186.64s)]
*  He's really embraced crypto. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=190.4s)]
*  And he's saying that he wants the United States to be the crypto capital of the world. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=192.48s)]
*  In the meantime, Biden and Harris, they're clamping down on crypto and it's a booming [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=196.44s)]
*  industry. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=200.8s)]
*  People are upset. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=201.8s)]
*  This is their livelihood. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=202.8s)]
*  Not to mention TikTok. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=203.8s)]
*  You have all the millennials out there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=204.8s)]
*  Very, very upset. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=206.8s)]
*  Well, it's interesting that it sounds to me like there's this shift. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=208.8s)]
*  We tend to think of big tech, especially in financial tech, as being sort of right or [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=212.04s)]
*  make that left leaning. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=216.24s)]
*  Is there a shift to the right happening organically? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=217.8s)]
*  Kevin, that's such a great point. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=219.92s)]
*  I don't think it's just the business world. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=221.68s)]
*  I think it's across the country. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=223.36s)]
*  People are fed up and they realize that Biden and Harris, they lied to us for the past four [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=226.36s)]
*  years about the cognitive state of our president and they failed on immigration. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=229.56s)]
*  The expiration of Title 42 was the original sin. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=233.76s)]
*  Millions of migrants poured into the country. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=237.56s)]
*  And I am a naturalized immigrant myself. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=239.16s)]
*  I'm speaking as an immigrant. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=241.0s)]
*  My family and I came here with $200. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  We never took a handout. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  We waited in line. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  We followed all the rules. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  So for immigrants like me, who became naturalized Americans, proud and grateful Americans, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=248.52s)]
*  it's extremely upsetting that people are just flooding into the country willy nilly. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=253.04s)]
*  So it's a rightward shift, both in tech and other areas too. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=257.06s)]
*  Lindy Lee, always a pleasure, my friend. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=260.08s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQd8hrykOn4&t=261.96s)]
