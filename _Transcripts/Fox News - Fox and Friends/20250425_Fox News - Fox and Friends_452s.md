# Gabbard reveals possible motivation behind intel leaks
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0)
*  The director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, is here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=0.0s)]
*  And she's saying this. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Deep state criminals, and she puts him on notice, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  referring to two alleged leakers of classified info [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=7.26s)]
*  of the JOJ for prosecution. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=10.1s)]
*  So two and more are coming. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=11.84s)]
*  Third referral is on the way. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=13.88s)]
*  Here to explain is the director of national intelligence, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=15.6s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=18.28s)]
*  Director, great to see you in person. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=19.34s)]
*  Good to see you, Brian. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=20.38s)]
*  So I read about this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=21.22s)]
*  We had, you indicated to me this was happening. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  Two people have been found to be leaking, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=25.26s)]
*  a third on its way. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=27.36s)]
*  Can you give me the nature of the leaks [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=28.94s)]
*  and how you discovered it? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=30.9s)]
*  Let's just first of all point out what we know [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=32.34s)]
*  has been the problem for a very long time. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=34.08s)]
*  One of the reasons why the American people voted [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=36.06s)]
*  resoundingly for President Trump was to root out [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=38.14s)]
*  the kind of politicization and weaponization of intelligence [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=40.74s)]
*  that has really undermined the trust the American people [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=45.56s)]
*  have in the intelligence community [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=47.74s)]
*  and the national security state, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=49.18s)]
*  but really what also directly undermines [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=50.94s)]
*  our own national security. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=53.1s)]
*  So I made it very clear to the US Senate, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=54.2s)]
*  to the American people when I had the honor [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=57.22s)]
*  of being appointed to this position [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=59.22s)]
*  that we will not allow this to continue. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=61.72s)]
*  We take this very seriously. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=63.64s)]
*  It is illegal to leak classified information [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=65.02s)]
*  and so what you're seeing here is me carrying out [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=68.62s)]
*  on the promise and the mandate [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=71.18s)]
*  the American people gave Trump. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=72.5s)]
*  We conducted our own internal investigation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=74.18s)]
*  We have referred them now to the Department of Justice [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=76.18s)]
*  and the FBI for an official criminal investigation [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=78.66s)]
*  because these are crimes and people need to be held [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=81.7s)]
*  accountable to put a stop to this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=84.52s)]
*  You were a Congresswoman, we talked about this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=85.9s)]
*  There's people within the department not undermined, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=88.62s)]
*  not selling secrets to Russia or China. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=91.10000000000001s)]
*  Well, we're keeping an eye out for that too. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=94.02000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely, but undermining the policy [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=95.9s)]
*  of the administration, the first administration. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=98.82000000000001s)]
*  Working against you at the CIA, working against you. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=101.18s)]
*  Now you're finding this out. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=104.22s)]
*  So you found people who seem motivated [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=105.66000000000001s)]
*  to undermine the president. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=108.9s)]
*  When we look at the examples that I've seen [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=110.54s)]
*  just in the short time that I've been in this position, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=113.04s)]
*  what they consist of is essentially very selective leaks [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  to their friends in the propaganda media [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=120.06s)]
*  that twist and manipulate intelligence [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  directly to undermine the president's policies [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=125.78s)]
*  and his aggressive work to keep the American people safe. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=128.9s)]
*  So does that third person know that you're zeroing in on them? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if they know, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=136.70000000000002s)]
*  but these are the first three investigations [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=138.74s)]
*  we are referring to the Department of Justice. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=141.38s)]
*  There are more that we are continuing to, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=143.98s)]
*  investigations we're continuing internally. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=146.5s)]
*  Can you give me the nature of what they did [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=148.34s)]
*  and will we know their names? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=149.82s)]
*  I can't get into detail now [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=151.22s)]
*  because of the criminal investigations [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=153.06s)]
*  that the FBI will be conducting. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=155.22s)]
*  But in each one of these examples, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  I can tell you we know that the intent, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=159.54s)]
*  based on the result that we've seen, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=163.26s)]
*  through their leaks to the Washington Post, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=164.56s)]
*  the New York Times and other outlets, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=166.33999999999997s)]
*  Huffington Post and others, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=168.01999999999998s)]
*  has been directly to undermine President Trump [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=169.82s)]
*  and the work that he's doing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=172.29999999999998s)]
*  In cooperation with the director of the CIA and the FBI, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=174.7s)]
*  since you're overseeing all of it, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=177.66s)]
*  so it could be any of those bureaus beneath you? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=179.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=183.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=184.1s)]
*  We just had the Secretary of Defense on [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=185.22s)]
*  and he also is dealing with leak issues, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=187.1s)]
*  three of which have been fired, maybe a four queued up. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=189.62s)]
*  As Director of National Intelligence, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=192.26s)]
*  do you have a role in that investigation? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=193.78s)]
*  I don't. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=196.33999999999997s)]
*  The Department of Defense [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=197.17999999999998s)]
*  is conducting their own investigation. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=198.1s)]
*  I've not been involved with or connected to that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=200.7s)]
*  What we are looking at is specifically [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=203.17999999999998s)]
*  within the intelligence community. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=204.73999999999998s)]
*  So that means the Office of the Director [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  of National Intelligence, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=208.17999999999998s)]
*  but also with purview over the 18 different [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=209.7s)]
*  intelligence elements that I have oversight over. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=212.1s)]
*  Can you give me what you were told [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=215.5s)]
*  about you need to be able to communicate in real time, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=217.33999999999997s)]
*  rapidly, with people at your level in a secure location? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=220.38s)]
*  Thanks to the Chinese infiltrating just about everything [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=224.94s)]
*  under the Biden administration, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=227.45999999999998s)]
*  everyone was told to use the Signal app. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=228.98s)]
*  What is the protocol for the administration [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=231.98s)]
*  about using the Signal app? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=234.54s)]
*  It's very simple, obviously. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=236.78s)]
*  We have official secure means of communication, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=238.29999999999998s)]
*  whether it's email or phone. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=241.98s)]
*  That is the preferred method of communication. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=243.89999999999998s)]
*  If, for example, someone is traveling, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  they're on the road. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=249.01999999999998s)]
*  Which happens all the time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=250.45999999999998s)]
*  Which obviously, we're not all locked to our desks, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=251.54s)]
*  which is a good thing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=253.94s)]
*  Limited use of an end-to-end encrypted app like Signal [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=256.53999999999996s)]
*  is not only authorized under this administration, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=260.66s)]
*  it was used prolifically under the Biden administration [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=263.02s)]
*  as well, recognizing that that's the most secure form [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=265.86s)]
*  of communication, but not using it [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=268.82s)]
*  to communicate classified information, of course. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=271.26s)]
*  Was Jake Sullivan and former Secretary of State [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=273.38s)]
*  Anthony Blink, were they communicating that way? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=275.58s)]
*  I have been told by people who have firsthand experience, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=277.58s)]
*  they communicated prolifically [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=280.82s)]
*  and in great detail using the Signal app. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=283.22s)]
*  So, yesterday- [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=285.1s)]
*  Which is interesting, because the Democrats on the committee [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=285.94s)]
*  and people who've been talking about this [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=288.1s)]
*  have never questioned or acknowledged that fact, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=290.14000000000004s)]
*  even though we know that they know. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=292.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's important for people to point out [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=294.46000000000004s)]
*  that there's very few options, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=296.46000000000004s)]
*  because the Chinese have penetrated [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=298.22s)]
*  into almost every major communication device. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=302.14000000000004s)]
*  It's just practical. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=304.06s)]
*  We have to be able to communicate. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  That is the most secure way to communicate. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=307.38s)]
*  Obviously, carefully, limited, but we have to have options. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  So, just so you know, there's a big story out today [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=314.02000000000004s)]
*  that the Secretary of Defense was using the Signal app [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=316.42s)]
*  on his desktop. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=318.94s)]
*  And his spokesperson, Sean Parnell, said this, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=320.02s)]
*  the Secretary's use of communication systems [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=322.5s)]
*  and channels is classified. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=324.97999999999996s)]
*  However, we can confirm that the Secretary has never used [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=326.18s)]
*  or does not currently use Signal on his government computer. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=328.82s)]
*  When you get briefed, like I get briefed when I started here, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=332.41999999999996s)]
*  this is what you can do, this is what you can't do. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=335.06s)]
*  What do they tell you? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=337.18s)]
*  I mean, isn't this, these are stories [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=338.21999999999997s)]
*  that really come from protocol, isn't it? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=340.9s)]
*  Well, first of all, the Signal app has been uploaded [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=344.26s)]
*  on government phones specifically to be able to use [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=349.18s)]
*  in those exigent circumstances where it is needed [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=352.58s)]
*  to be able to communicate. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=355.5s)]
*  The point is being very careful in how you're using [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=357.82s)]
*  any means of communication [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=360.38s)]
*  if it is not a secure government classified system. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=361.90000000000003s)]
*  You're not new to Congress, you're not new to Washington. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=365.86s)]
*  No. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=368.38s)]
*  But you're in a position, you couldn't possibly be known [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=369.22s)]
*  everything you were getting into. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=372.74s)]
*  What's been the biggest surprise since you took over? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=374.1s)]
*  What's one of the biggest adjustments [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=376.02s)]
*  since you've taken over? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=377.66s)]
*  There's a long list, but really the levels [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=379.86s)]
*  of very serious, deep reform that is essential. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=383.46000000000004s)]
*  Number one, to restore trust on behalf of the American people [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=387.38000000000005s)]
*  in these institutions to keep the American people safe [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=391.46000000000004s)]
*  and being able to make sure that across the board, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=395.62s)]
*  we are focusing on that foremost mission. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=398.58000000000004s)]
*  There are obviously the DEI stuff [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=401.3s)]
*  that has been a huge distraction. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=403.14000000000004s)]
*  I've had employees come and talk to me [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=404.66s)]
*  and say they were expected to spend half of their day [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=406.66s)]
*  within the intelligence community focused on DEI work. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=410.1s)]
*  So if you can imagine when we have intelligence professionals [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=413.14s)]
*  and analysts whose mission it is to make sure [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=415.98s)]
*  that the president has relevant, timely, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=418.58s)]
*  apolitical objective intelligence to make his decisions by. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=420.94s)]
*  But in the last administration, they're told, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=424.38s)]
*  you gotta spend half your day on DEI work. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=426.34000000000003s)]
*  We can understand why the capabilities [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=429.58s)]
*  in some cases were so degraded. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=433.7s)]
*  Well, without DEI, you got free time to do it [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=435.62s)]
*  with everyone's supposed to be doing. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=438.3s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=439.70000000000005s)]
*  Thanks so much for coming in. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z46y3lcJSb0&t=440.70000000000005s)]
