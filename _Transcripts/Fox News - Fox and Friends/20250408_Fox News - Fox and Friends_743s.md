# Supreme Court delivers win for Trump: 'A liberal judge is not going to stop us'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo)
*  And here we go. Fox News alert the Supreme Court given a major boost to President Trump's border agenda, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=0.0s)]
*  clearing the way for deportation flights to resume using the Alien and Enemies Act [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=5.88s)]
*  after an Obama-appointed judge tried to block it. Let's bring in the Attorney General for the United States, Pam Bondi. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=12.32s)]
*  Madam Attorney General, thank you so much for joining the program. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=19.12s)]
*  Thank you. Good morning. It's a great day for America and it's a great day to be a Florida Gator. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=22.36s)]
*  Well, yes it is. More news on that later, Madam Attorney General. But let's talk about what the court did. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=28.48s)]
*  Essentially, you know, they didn't rule when it comes to the Alien and Enemy Act. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=35.6s)]
*  What they said was this was the wrong venue, that the D.C. Circuit Court had no jurisdiction over that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=39.8s)]
*  But they also said, listen, if there's due process, then they have to do it through the normal channels, through a habeas writ. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=46.96s)]
*  So what is the administration reaction to all that the Supreme Court just said yesterday? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=55.56s)]
*  Well, Lawrence, this is a landmark victory for the rule of law. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=62.28s)]
*  And this is what we've been arguing on behalf of President Trump from day one. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=66.0s)]
*  These are enemies of our state, of our country, and they should be deported. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=70.2s)]
*  And what the judge ruled was going forward from this day forward, all those planes that are gone are there. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=76.28s)]
*  Those people are staying. So there are a lot of reasons why Americans are safer. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=83.36s)]
*  From this point forward, the hearing will be held, it's a habeas hearing, in the Court of Confinement, which means in Texas. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=87.84s)]
*  So it will be a much faster hearing. They can't do class actions. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=95.32s)]
*  It will be a much smoother, simpler hearing. And these people will be deported. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=99.08s)]
*  Americans are safer. And domestic terrorists, foreign terrorists, you better look out because we're coming after you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=104.28s)]
*  I'd start self-deporting if I were you, because we're going to find you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=110.64s)]
*  So, Madam Attorney General, let's get this on record because I think it's important for the audience to understand. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=116.08s)]
*  Going forward, there's no shopping as it relates to immigration anymore. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=121.72s)]
*  If someone is detained and scheduled for a deportation, they can no longer shop across the country for a judge, a liberal-leaning judge. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=126.6s)]
*  And now all the cases going forward have to go to that Texas judge. Is that correct? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=136.0s)]
*  Correct, Lawrence. And that's what was happening. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=142.44s)]
*  These liberal district judges thought that they could control our entire country's policy, Donald Trump's policy, on keeping America safe. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=144.64s)]
*  They cannot do it. And this was, again, a landmark ruling for the rule of law yesterday. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=153.68s)]
*  And it's so important because these flights will now continue. These terrorists, they are foreign terrorists. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=159.0s)]
*  They are alien enemies to our country, and we will continue to deport them. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=165.88s)]
*  We are going to keep America safe, and a liberal district judge is not going to stop us. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  And that's what the Supreme Court ruled yesterday. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=175.6s)]
*  So, Madam Attorney General, let's talk about the judge in D.C., Boasberg. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=179.72s)]
*  There's a hearing scheduled today. Will that happen? I mean, this is essentially over. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=183.8s)]
*  Will he still try to use some type of power that he has? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=190.72s)]
*  There is a hearing scheduled today at 3 p.m. He is not canceling the hearing. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=196.68s)]
*  He is continuing on with the hearing, but the Supreme Court has spoken loud and clear. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=200.96s)]
*  He has no jurisdiction. That flight will remain in El Salvador. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=206.84s)]
*  Those inmates, those violent gang members, those violent alien enemies will remain in El Salvador. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=211.88s)]
*  He cannot get them back. So his jurisdiction is over. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  So we'll see what he says today at 3 p.m. But going forward, these terrorists better look out. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=221.72s)]
*  Let's talk about this DOJ attorney that you have since put on leave. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  As I was reviewing the case, I felt a lot of the action skeptical, interesting. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=234.68s)]
*  It seemed like this attorney was arguing for the other side and not for the United States at that moment. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=240.72s)]
*  At what point did you make the decision to pull him off the case? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=248.32s)]
*  Well, we represent the United States of America. That's our client. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=253.16s)]
*  That's our only client and all the agencies that fall under the federal government. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=257.68s)]
*  And any lawyer has an ethical duty to argue on behalf of their client, not against their client. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=262.32s)]
*  And that's what happened in this case. He has been placed on administrative leave. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=269.32s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=273.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was the right decision. You're exactly right. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=278.4s)]
*  There have to be consequences for your actions. There will be consequences for your actions. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=281.92s)]
*  You have to ethically argue on behalf of your client. And that wasn't happening in this case. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  That's exactly right. So, Madam Attorney General, it looks like Maine is upset. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=293.16s)]
*  The state of Maine. The president made it very clear that no more men in women's sports. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  It's not going to happen. As a result of that, he took a lot of the funding away since they didn't want to comply. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=302.04s)]
*  They have since decided that they're going to sue the United States government. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=307.04s)]
*  You're going to be representing the government. What can you tell us? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=311.12s)]
*  Well, we were right to do that. President Trump has the right to determine where the money goes, where federal money goes. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=315.12s)]
*  And also, Lawrence, on Friday, we got a great win, too, with the Department of Justice. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=323.44s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruled in our favor on DEI and where this money can go with the Department of Education. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=326.76s)]
*  So that falls for every agency. We can determine where that money goes. All federal money. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=332.44s)]
*  Now, back to Maine. Yeah, what's happening there is they're not abiding by what President Trump said. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=337.52s)]
*  They're allowing men and women's sports. And in the case right now, what we did last night, some breaking news. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=343.0s)]
*  We pulled all non-essential funding from the Department of Corrections in Maine because they were allowing a man in a woman's prison. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=348.92s)]
*  A giant six foot one, two hundred and forty five pound guy who committed a double murder with a knife, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=356.76000000000005s)]
*  stabbed his parents to death and the family dog. And he identified as a woman. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=363.76000000000005s)]
*  So they were letting him be housed in a female prison. No longer. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  We will pull your funding. We will protect women in prison. We will protect women in sports. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=373.8s)]
*  We will protect women throughout this country. No more of that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=378.88000000000005s)]
*  It's unbelievable that we're still dealing with this issue. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=382.44s)]
*  It seems like the American people have spoken on this issue, but the resistance campaign continues. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=388.32s)]
*  Madam Attorney General, thank you so much for joining Fox and Friends this morning. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=393.12s)]
*  Thank you. Have a great day. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=396.48s)]
*  To a Fox News alert now, the Trump administration celebrating the big Supreme Court win, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=398.36s)]
*  allowing them to resume deportation fights under the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=402.64s)]
*  Madeline Rivera joins us now with more and Maddie, it all comes down to the Supreme Court said, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  what are you doing? You filed this in the wrong state. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=413.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so the Supreme Court's ruling here was pretty narrow, but nevertheless, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  both sides are claiming victory to some extent after the High Court's five four ruling on Monday. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=420.44000000000005s)]
*  I want you to take a listen to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=425.8s)]
*  Today is a bad day to be a terrorist in the United States of America. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=430.20000000000005s)]
*  Today, the Supreme Court came out with a decision that reaffirmed President Trump was correct [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=433.08s)]
*  in using his authority on using the Alien Enemies Act to deport terrorists out of this country. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=438.12s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi saying tonight's decision is a landmark victory for the rule of law. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=444.76s)]
*  An activist judge in Washington, D.C. does not have the jurisdiction to seize control of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=449.64s)]
*  President Trump's authority to conduct foreign policy and keep the American people safe. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=454.36s)]
*  But the Supreme Court did not decide whether the administration's invocation of the Alien [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=459.72s)]
*  Enemies Act was constitutional. It ruled that the challengers brought their lawsuit to the wrong [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=463.88000000000005s)]
*  court. They should have filed it in a Texas federal court where the detentions took place [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=469.24s)]
*  and not in a D.C. federal court. The justices also agree the detainees must have the chance [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=474.12s)]
*  to challenge their removals and the ACLU is taking that as a victory. Federal Judge James [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=479.56s)]
*  Boesberg, who had initially blocked the Trump administration from continuing those deportation [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=485.48s)]
*  flights under the Alien Enemies Act, is holding a hearing today. He will likely take the Supreme [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=490.20000000000005s)]
*  Court's decision into account. Also on Monday, Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily paused a [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=495.08000000000004s)]
*  midnight deadline for the Trump administration to return a Maryland resident, Kilmar Abrego Garcia. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=500.76s)]
*  You see him there on your screen back to the United States. Robert's order will give the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=506.36s)]
*  full court more time to consider the case. Although the government says Garcia's deportation was an [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=510.76s)]
*  administrative error, Bondi says ICE members have testified he's an MS-13 gang member. Garcia's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  lawyers argue, though, he's not been charged with any crime in any country. Steve Ainsley and Brian. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=522.84s)]
*  All right, Madeline, thank you very much. Let's bring in Lawrence Jones. He's live in El Paso. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=528.6s)]
*  You saw him a moment ago where they were training the dogs. Lawrence, what's interesting about the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=532.76s)]
*  finding yesterday from the Supreme Court, the ruling, the decision, is that the administration [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=538.28s)]
*  can continue to deport people under the Aliens and Enemies Act, but before they deport them, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=544.36s)]
*  they got to say, okay, you're being deported under this act, and then they're going to get some due [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=551.0799999999999s)]
*  process. So they can continue, but there's going to be a pause where lawyers get involved. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=555.8s)]
*  Yeah, so a couple things from this. First of all, the D.C. Chief Judge should have made this decision [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=561.8s)]
*  to begin with. This shouldn't have never made it to the Supreme Court because he knew that he didn't [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=570.68s)]
*  have jurisdiction over it. You have someone that's been held in Texas, and then you have a D.C. Circuit [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=576.12s)]
*  Judge that is overseeing it. That should have never happened. So what the Supreme Court said, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=582.76s)]
*  this was an improper venue, and any time someone is held, whether it's an immigration case or any [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=587.56s)]
*  other federal crime, it has to happen wherever they're held at. And so they sent it right back [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=593.4s)]
*  to Texas. The second part, which is what you were alluding to, was the due process. What they're [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=600.92s)]
*  saying is that you have to file a habeas petition. They're not disputing the flights yet. None of that [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=606.04s)]
*  is happening. But this is not exclusive to immigration. If you have any issue with detainment [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=611.8s)]
*  and your lawyer wants to post some type of legal order, you got to file a habeas petition in the [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=617.88s)]
*  area where you're being held and let that judge handle it. I think it was a great win for the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=623.56s)]
*  administration, but it also was a great day for the rule of law. No more venue shopping when it [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=628.28s)]
*  comes to immigration. Yeah, and you had that judge that was saying you need to bring that MS-13, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=633.8s)]
*  alleged MS-13 gang member back home. He's in El Salvador in that maximum prison. You need to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=639.32s)]
*  bring him home by midnight on Monday. And you had Chief Justice John Roberts say, no, we're going [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=644.36s)]
*  to pause that while we investigate. Let me see if this guy really is MS-13, what he's done. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=651.08s)]
*  So that's just paused for now. But that's another win for Donald Trump. I just worry about the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=657.08s)]
*  already overburdened court system. I wish there was an intermediate way, like a special judge, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=661.16s)]
*  to get a hearing because now we've got to get him a lawyer. We've got to hold them up. We've [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=665.96s)]
*  got to feed them. There's going to be, who knows, can they appeal the sentence? And how long is it [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=669.1600000000001s)]
*  going to take for them to go through the courts? Right. So it would eliminate all controversy. So [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=672.76s)]
*  anybody on that plane would get all the way, you know, you'd get the due process that all of us [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=677.88s)]
*  would get, which I just don't know if they're worthy of it. I'm wondering if there was some [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=682.44s)]
*  type of military expeditious way to do it. Well, you've got to wonder because it's based on the [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=686.52s)]
*  president of the United States has said, I'm going to deport them because they're members of [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=692.28s)]
*  the gang. I would imagine it would be easy, pretty, it would go really fast if the federal [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=695.8s)]
*  government just said, okay, here's our proof that the guy's in a gang. Ultimately, that's what you [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=701.48s)]
*  want to know because the Garcia guy who we were talking about, who's stuck in a legal limbo, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=706.04s)]
*  his lawyer say he was never in a gang as Mattie just said, he was never charged. So if the, as [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=712.76s)]
*  quickly as the government can say, look, this is a TDA guy, this is an MS-13 guy, boom, they [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=718.04s)]
*  had their day in court. But the problem is then the TDA guy has Matt Locke as a lawyer. I, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=723.0s)]
*  it's the wrong guy, wrong neck tattoo. That's what the Supreme Court says you've got to get. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNdsAOAFOdo&t=728.76s)]
