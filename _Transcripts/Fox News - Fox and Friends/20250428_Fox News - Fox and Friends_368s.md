# Bondi reveals SHOCKING new details on Colorado nightclub raid
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4)
*  Meanwhile, I'm here at the White House as President Trump is going to mark 100 days [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=0.0s)]
*  in office tomorrow. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=3.48s)]
*  Today, he is highlighting his border agenda. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=4.48s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi is here now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  And she has everything to do with the video you just saw her in Colorado Springs. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Ms. Attorney General, thanks so much for seeing me. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=14.68s)]
*  My first time seeing you since you got the job. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=16.2s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=19.2s)]
*  Tell us what you were thinking about when we were watching that video seconds ago. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=20.2s)]
*  America is safer tonight thanks to Donald Trump. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=23.68s)]
*  Last night, Brian, what they did. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=26.78s)]
*  During the Biden administration, they received 170 911 calls to that club alone. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=29.12s)]
*  That club we were just watching, 170 calls. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=35.36s)]
*  Wouldn't you think that would have been a red flag? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=38.04s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=41.0s)]
*  Guns, shootings, ag batteries, nothing happened. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=42.0s)]
*  So under Donald Trump, DEA, FBI, US Marshals, ATF, ICE, everyone went in together. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=45.04s)]
*  DEA led this investigation, went in, got 115 illegal immigrants, aliens in our country, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=52.48s)]
*  arrested them, two with warrants, 12 guns seized. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=62.72s)]
*  So what would happen in this club is you would go in, security would give you a menu of drugs, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=66.46s)]
*  cocaine, there's something new called pink cocaine, meth, you could go in a bathroom stall, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=72.4s)]
*  get that, there was prostitution, all these things going on. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=78.24s)]
*  We just now identified a member of Sinaloa Cartel was also in there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=81.26s)]
*  So that's interesting because it's not a sanctuary city, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=85.06s)]
*  Denver is. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=87.86s)]
*  But Colorado Springs isn't. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=89.42s)]
*  You look at this for the longest time, what is the downside of raiding that club during [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=91.08s)]
*  the Biden years? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=96.56s)]
*  What's the negative side of it? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=98.02s)]
*  Do you prefer illegal drug use and illegal aliens? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=99.18s)]
*  And prostitution and the violence and the shootings and the guns that was happening [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=102.42s)]
*  in that club and no one did anything after 170 911 calls. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  Yet President Trump immediately, you know, that was a really dangerous operation too. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=111.55999999999999s)]
*  And that's why there were 300 agents all working hand in hand. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  And that's what Donald Trump has done so well. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=120.02s)]
*  All of our agencies work so well together. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  Went in there, got these bad guys out, 115 arrests, 12 guns off the streets, lots of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=124.25999999999999s)]
*  drugs off the streets now, less prostitution as a result. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=130.48s)]
*  You know, it's so interesting. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=134.04s)]
*  Kellyanne Conway did a great job focusing on fentanyl when it started emerging as the plague [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=135.48s)]
*  that's killed our country and so many young people in the first term. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=140.0s)]
*  But you guys have really amped it up working with border security in terms of fentanyl [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  taking it off the streets. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=148.72s)]
*  Do you have a do you have a number there? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=149.72s)]
*  Yeah, Brian, when I was state AG, I actually worked with Kellyanne when she was in the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  White House on this because the fentanyl was just emerging on the market. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=156.32s)]
*  And yes, now since Donald Trump has been in office, DEA has seized over 21 million [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=160.28s)]
*  fentanyl pills. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=167.08s)]
*  That's 21 million lives saved, in my opinion, off the streets. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=168.8s)]
*  No doubt about it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=172.08s)]
*  We also know too, at the cusp of all the tariffs, is getting China to stop sending the precursors [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=173.08s)]
*  to Mexico. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=177.88s)]
*  If China would actually act responsibly, that would help your job a lot. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=179.02s)]
*  It wouldn't even get to you, hopefully. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=182.32s)]
*  So let's talk about what's going on with these judges. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=184.72s)]
*  The sensational video last week of having to arrest a judge and now we have another [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=186.8s)]
*  judge reporting in Wisconsin boycotting their courtroom we're threatening to unless this [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  judge is released. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=195.22s)]
*  Tell me about this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=196.52s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=197.52s)]
*  Well, the judge, her name last name is Dugan. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=198.52s)]
*  She is in Milwaukee. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=200.52s)]
*  And what she did to set the stage for that, there was a domestic violence case pending. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  This defendant was charged with pummeling a man in the face 30 times. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  That's like an MMA fight. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  He fell to the ground. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  He had strangled him. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  And he punched a woman with a closed fist so hard in the face that she fell to the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=216.28s)]
*  ground. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=220.48s)]
*  Both victims went to the hospital. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=221.48s)]
*  And you know domestic violence cases, it's hard enough to get a victim to cooperate. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  Both victims were sitting in that courtroom wanting justice with a state prosecutor. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=227.04s)]
*  Court goes on. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  All of a sudden the case isn't on the docket. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  Defendants know where to be found. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=235.84s)]
*  They found out that the judge learned that ICE was outside because he was an illegal [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=237.12s)]
*  alien from Mexico to arrest him, to deport him. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=241.6s)]
*  She found that out. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=245.54s)]
*  She raised her voice with ICE, told them to go see the chief judge, came back in. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=246.7s)]
*  While court was going on, she motioned for the defense attorney and the defendant to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=252.38s)]
*  come up, snuck them out through a private chamber. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=257.74s)]
*  You can't make this up. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=261.78s)]
*  In her courtroom, snuck them out a back exit so he could run down the street. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=263.42s)]
*  ICE ended up chasing him down the street. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=267.5s)]
*  Someone saw him, chased him, caught him eventually. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=270.98s)]
*  The reason ICE, they make arrests in courtrooms all the time is because it's safe. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=273.5s)]
*  A defendant has gone through security. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=278.85999999999996s)]
*  They don't have a weapon. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=280.62s)]
*  It's an easy arrest. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=281.78s)]
*  No one's injured. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=283.26s)]
*  But because she did, she jeopardized the lives of law enforcement officers. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=284.38s)]
*  Even the defendant, by doing this, they had to have a chase down the street while victims [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=288.06s)]
*  of a crime were sitting in a courtroom. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  Judge in jail? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=295.09999999999997s)]
*  Judge got arrested. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=296.29999999999995s)]
*  She sure did. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=297.29999999999995s)]
*  So David Brooks, you know, the columnist for the New York Times, who on PBS over the weekend [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=298.5s)]
*  said that the judge acted heroic. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=302.86s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=306.3s)]
*  I say the victims of crime should be very happy today because these victims of crime, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=307.38s)]
*  they deserve justice. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  This is a criminal judge sitting on a criminal bench. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=314.58000000000004s)]
*  And anyone who's going to let an anyone, any criminal defendant out a back door is absurd. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=318.26s)]
*  How much harder is your job in these sanctuary cities? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  It's difficult. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=330.90000000000003s)]
*  We have Tom Homan. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=331.94s)]
*  We have HSI. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=332.94s)]
*  We have incredible partners working with us to get in there. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=334.34s)]
*  And you know, state law enforcement, Brian, they want to do their jobs, most of them. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=337.97999999999996s)]
*  Their hands have just been tied. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=342.02s)]
*  It's going to have to go right up the court ladder. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=343.29999999999995s)]
*  It sure is. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=345.26s)]
*  And that's what we're doing. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=346.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=347.26s)]
*  And busy day, especially they salute today is about border security and security in the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=348.26s)]
*  country as you look back at 100 days. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=351.09999999999997s)]
*  And you hope, of course, the best is yet to come. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=353.94s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=355.97999999999996s)]
*  Attorney General, thanks so much. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=356.97999999999996s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4CY6hOFf4&t=357.97999999999996s)]
