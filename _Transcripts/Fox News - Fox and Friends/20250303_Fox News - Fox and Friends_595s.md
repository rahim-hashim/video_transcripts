# Trump adviser's new warning to Zelenskyy: 'Time is not on his side'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE)
*  So we want to find what the American people are thinking. I think Dana for the purposes of the numbers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm about to show you and this goes back a ways now [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=4.9s)]
*  Sometimes it's six weeks sometimes two years is that the political parties really see this story in a very different way, okay? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=7.36s)]
*  So this is our polling from six weeks ago. How concerned are you about Russia's invasion? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=15.4s)]
*  This here, I think it's quite telling extremely or very okay [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=21.52s)]
*  So it's about two-thirds of the American people Democrats much more at 73 Republicans less at 54 then look at this from Gallup [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=25.44s)]
*  Okay, so this is the last couple of weeks now [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=32.96s)]
*  US support of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=35.24s)]
*  Ukraine limited time frame or as long as it takes so Republicans are two-thirds for limited time frame [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  Democrats are about two-thirds for as long as it takes and I'm gonna in two more frames here [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=44.56s)]
*  I'm gonna show you really a telling graph. I think about the current conflict [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  How do you feel about ending the war in Ukraine? Do you support reclaiming territory to end it quickly? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=54.24s)]
*  I find a bit of a split here, right 58 to 40 percent [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  But these are the lines I think that really tell a story in red is Republican in blue is Democrat [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=63.28s)]
*  Here's the question should it end as quickly as possible [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  This Republican line here goes to 74 percent the Democratic line goes to about 35 percent [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  But clearly there there's a difference of opinion here, you know Republicans and Democrats [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=79.0s)]
*  Independence by the way in the middle of 47 percent all that said if you watch the shows on Sunday [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=84.36s)]
*  They are adamant that so Lindsey's got to do the deal and then we can put the pressure on Putin watch here [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=90.08s)]
*  Either he needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=98.32s)]
*  Someone else needs to leave the country to do that. I don't agree [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=103.28s)]
*  I don't I'm not interested in calling on the resignation of other world leaders [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  I didn't like it when Chuck Schumer asked for nets and Yahoo to be removed [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=110.0s)]
*  I don't like it when other members of the Senate asked for Zelensky to be removed either that would spiral [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=113.22s)]
*  Ukraine into chaos right now [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  National Security Advisor Michael Waltz joins us now. We're so glad to have you. Thank you so much [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=120.64s)]
*  So okay, so Friday happened and now looking forward [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm curious how you would describe what does President Trump think success looks like at the end of this [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=129.04s)]
*  Conversation with Zelensky and does it include Zelensky in the end? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=135.0s)]
*  Well, thanks Dana here's what success looked like looks like and you heard President Trump say it repeatedly in that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  Just really truly ridiculous and unacceptable session [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=148.08s)]
*  Right behind me in the White House [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=152.28000000000003s)]
*  success looks like [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=154.68s)]
*  President Zelensky sitting down and talking the terms of peace [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=156.4s)]
*  Talking about what he needs to see Ukraine needs to see to get to a partial partial ceasefire a permanent ceasefire [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=160.72s)]
*  And an end to this war and what became so evident to us in that session was he's not ready to talk peace at all [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=168.64s)]
*  But here's the problem time is not on his side time is not on the side of just forever [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=176.32s)]
*  Continuing this conflict the American people's patience is not unlimited [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=182.24s)]
*  Their wallets are not unlimited and our stockpiles and munitions are not unlimited that we need for all kinds of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=187.08s)]
*  Contingencies around the world. So the time to talk is now and you know what we're hearing in terms of alternatives [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=194.16s)]
*  Whether it's the Democrats or leaders around the world is essentially continuing this grinding [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=201.16s)]
*  World War one style trench warfare that is a meat grinder of people [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=208.16s)]
*  Munitions and and national treasure the president campaigned on ending ending this war. He was elected to end this war [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=213.04s)]
*  He will be the peacemaker-in-chief [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  But it was really confounding to us that so once he could have left the White House Friday having the US and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=222.76s)]
*  Ukraine bound together economically for a generation [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  You have the British talking about troops on the ground and a security guarantee the French talking about troops on the ground and security guarantee [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=233.6s)]
*  We even had the NATO secretary-general talked to the president just before the Zelensky meeting [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=240.68s)]
*  So this was no ambush. This was an opportunity and a moment and I think President Zelensky truly did [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=246.28s)]
*  His country a real disservice by not having a positive outcome Friday [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=253.56s)]
*  And you know, we'll see where things are going forward. Okay, let's try and put the pieces together for our audience here [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=258.24s)]
*  Scott Besant said on CBS that Zelensky got the sequence out of order [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  Okay, a lot of things happening in Europe over the weekend. Let's start with it [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=269.2s)]
*  All right [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=273.32s)]
*  Here's the UK Prime Minister suggests keep the aid flowing to Kiev and clay include Ukraine at the bargaining table [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=273.52s)]
*  Ukraine must ensure its sovereignty and security and arm Ukraine to deter a further invasion [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=279.4s)]
*  Now you mentioned the French McCrone says let's go ahead and get a deal for a truce for one month [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=284.2s)]
*  The head of the EU said let's it's a time to rear arm Europe [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=290.03999999999996s)]
*  And then the British Prime Minister chimed in with this boots on the ground was the quote watch [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=293.7s)]
*  The UK is prepared to back this [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=299.2s)]
*  With boots on the ground and planes in the air to support peace in our continent and to succeed [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=301.96s)]
*  This effort must have strong US backing. We are at a crossroads in history today [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=308.76s)]
*  This is not a moment for more talk [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=315.32s)]
*  It's time to act time to step up and lead and unite around a new plan [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=318.32s)]
*  For a just and enduring piece, okay, so if all that is on the table here and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=324.88s)]
*  Zelensky comes back to sign this deal and he said this over the weekend [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=331.72s)]
*  There's not been a day when we haven't felt gratitude [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=335.06s)]
*  It's gratitude for the preservation of independence or resilience in Ukraine is based on what our partners are doing for us and for their own [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=337.12s)]
*  security if you can [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=343.48s)]
*  Align all this up, sir [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  You then put the pressure on Putin to find out whether or not he is ready for peace [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=348.16s)]
*  There's the White House believe he is at this moment [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=353.38s)]
*  Well that all of those things have to be tested [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=359.06s)]
*  Bill but what we don't have right now is president Zelensky saying I am ready to take the steps necessary [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=362.9s)]
*  And have the conversations necessary and make the compromises [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=370.9s)]
*  Necessary to end the fighting go to a ceasefire some permutation of there's one month. There's two week [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=375.34s)]
*  There's stopping long-range strikes on both sides on each other's energy infrastructure [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  We're all of those things are on the table [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=387.08000000000004s)]
*  But they were on the table before last Friday as well [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=389.48s)]
*  And what we essentially heard was he's not ready to talk about it as all as though [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=392.94s)]
*  You know grinding this war forward for the years to come is truly an option and it's not so we're ready to have those conversations [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=398.16s)]
*  We had it with the Russians in Riyadh [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  We're ready to have it with the Ukrainians and then engage in shuttle diplomacy [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=408.4s)]
*  But we need to hear that latter piece from Zelensky and we need to hear it publicly [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=412.52s)]
*  last question from me [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=417.4s)]
*  At the end of this if there is a deal that signed a minerals deal [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=419.12s)]
*  Does President Trump believe it will actually be with? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=424.0s)]
*  Zelensky or another leader? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=427.48s)]
*  Well, I think what happened Friday really put that up in the air is is Zelensky ready? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=430.2s)]
*  personally politically to move his country towards an end to the fighting and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=437.84s)]
*  Can he and will he make the compromises necessary and you heard the president both sides are going to have to make compromises? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=443.36s)]
*  I think a lot of people can see what those roughly will be [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=450.64s)]
*  in terms of security guarantee for some type of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=455.16s)]
*  territorial concessions those broad outlines are are evident does both sides have the will to sit down and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=459.32s)]
*  Drive this towards peace. That's President Trump's objective [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=467.0s)]
*  That's what he was elected to do and that's what we're ready to do and trying to do right now [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=470.68s)]
*  Okay, last question. You said Friday really put that up in the air [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=474.76s)]
*  If Zelensky doesn't lead Ukraine who does? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=478.92s)]
*  Well, look we're not going to get into you know [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=483.92s)]
*  Speculating on these issues in public what we need to hear from President Zelensky is that he has regret for what happened [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=488.76s)]
*  He's ready to sign this mineral deal and that he's ready to engage in peace talks [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=495.8s)]
*  I don't think that's too much to ask. I think that's what's best for the American people [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  For the Ukrainian people for Russia and for the world to restore stability [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=505.6s)]
*  President Trump is ready to end this war and there will be a process to do that that we've laid out and it was no [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  Accident we had key European leaders here saying they are ready to step up and provide those [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=517.0s)]
*  Security guarantees in the president even said with some type of [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=523.92s)]
*  American support to be negotiated [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=529.52s)]
*  So we're ready to enter in those negotiations is president Zelensky and will test [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=531.52s)]
*  Both sides in terms of their willingness to compromise to get this deal done. President Trump knows how to [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=537.5600000000001s)]
*  Surprise any possibility that this gets resolved and he announces it tomorrow night at his joint address to Congress [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=543.4s)]
*  Well, we'd certainly like to see that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=550.52s)]
*  We were we were planning to address to announce this minerals deal that it would have been signed Friday [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=552.92s)]
*  And was a very pop positive step forward for all sides and importantly for the American taxpayer [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=560.1999999999999s)]
*  Who is who has given so much of their hard-earned treasure? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ-lP0MWNE&t=566.88s)]
