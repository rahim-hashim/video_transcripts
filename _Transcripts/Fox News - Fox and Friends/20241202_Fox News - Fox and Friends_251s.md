# Mexican president reverses course after Trump threat
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k)
*  Meanwhile, let's talk a little bit about this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=0.0s)]
*  Just a week after Donald Trump threatened 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, unless [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=2.34s)]
*  they stopped the flow of migrants into the country, and we said at the time, we said [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=8.52s)]
*  this is how he negotiates, this is, you know, we'll never see the tariffs, but this is how [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=14.22s)]
*  he gets the people to the table. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=18.88s)]
*  There are two developments, up north and down south. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=20.68s)]
*  First up, it was just after the president, the incoming president, Donald Trump, spoke [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=23.5s)]
*  on the phone to the president of Mexico, and they talked about some sort of an agreement [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=28.9s)]
*  on stopping the flow of people into the United States. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=33.94s)]
*  Well, you know what happened? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=36.54s)]
*  Mexican authorities that same day broke up two migrant caravans heading to the United [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=38.739999999999995s)]
*  States. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=43.78s)]
*  And apparently, on that same day, the migrants and caravans, the new president of Mexico [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=44.78s)]
*  said that migrants and caravans will be taken care of before they reach the border. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=50.66s)]
*  That is something new, and that happened after her conversation with Donald Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  So regarding the South, that apparently is something new, and it was because of the tariffs. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=61.779999999999994s)]
*  That's what we were telling you all about these caravans. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=67.3s)]
*  What, last week, I guess, we were showing these images coming up to Mexico. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=70.58s)]
*  They wanted to get here before Joe Biden is out of office. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=73.9s)]
*  Well, now they're being stopped by the president of Mexico because Donald Trump won. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=76.66s)]
*  Donald Trump has threatened her. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=80.94s)]
*  Then she just put on social media, she said migrants and caravans, caravans are taking [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=82.53999999999999s)]
*  care of before they reach the border. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=86.78s)]
*  Wow, that's great news. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=89.38s)]
*  They did have a difference of opinion on what went on in that conversation on the tone and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=90.94s)]
*  tenure, but Justin Trudeau made no mistake about it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=94.9s)]
*  They had a good conversation, he said. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=97.5s)]
*  I have a better idea. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=98.86s)]
*  Why don't I come down over the weekend and come visit you? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=99.86s)]
*  And next thing you know, the Canadians are cracking down there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=102.42s)]
*  They got $3.1 trillion worth of goods going back and forth. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=104.54s)]
*  He's going to run for election in 2025. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=108.06s)]
*  He can't have any type of trade war with the U.S. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=111.06s)]
*  And they are concerned about the numbers crossing in their country. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=113.98s)]
*  And he said, you know, I do want to stop down the northern border. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=117.74000000000001s)]
*  How do we do it? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=119.9s)]
*  How do we work together? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=120.9s)]
*  So at Mar-a-Lago, they seem to have worked it out. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=121.9s)]
*  There is Senator-elect McCormick there and Governor Berger is going to be secretary. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=124.02000000000001s)]
*  That's the security advisor, Mike Walt. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=128.62s)]
*  That's Mike Walt. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=130.94s)]
*  That's a pretty prestigious table. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=131.94s)]
*  So now you have on both situations, engaged, active, addressing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=134.06s)]
*  Boy did I miss this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=139.54000000000002s)]
*  Look, every country's leader is going to go back home and beat their chest because they [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=141.66s)]
*  don't want to appear weak. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=145.70000000000002s)]
*  And this is what the Mexican president is doing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=146.70000000000002s)]
*  She's saying, look, the call went differently. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=148.46s)]
*  I don't judge it by that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=150.9s)]
*  I judge by the action. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=152.38s)]
*  And the bottom line is that the groups that are coming across have slowed down. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=153.86s)]
*  They've been disbarred. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=158.46s)]
*  They've been disbarred. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=159.46s)]
*  The caravan has been broken up. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=160.46s)]
*  So something happened over that phone. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=163.02s)]
*  And don't you think they watched? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=164.58s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=165.58s)]
*  I mean, he has a re-election in Trudeau. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=166.58s)]
*  And don't you think he watched what happened here in America? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=168.46s)]
*  He's like, wait a minute. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=170.34s)]
*  That's why he did that video saying, I'm going to go after immigration now. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=171.34s)]
*  Well, and the Canadian border minister told Bloomberg after the meeting at Mar-a-Lago, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=174.74s)]
*  now Canada is going to devote more drones and choppers and staff to the northern border, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=179.82000000000002s)]
*  our northern border, their southern border. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=185.82000000000002s)]
*  It's all because of the Trump tariff threat. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  That's all it took. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=191.82000000000002s)]
*  No, Steve, this is just a coincidence. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=192.82000000000002s)]
*  No, that's a party. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=195.66000000000003s)]
*  This is just happening by chance. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=197.58s)]
*  The phone call meant nothing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=200.06s)]
*  It has nothing to do with new administration coming in or not. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=201.06s)]
*  I think this is a promise made and a promise kept. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=205.3s)]
*  And remember, he said from the very beginning, some of this stuff was going to be done before [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=208.94s)]
*  he even took office. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=212.9s)]
*  And all the pundits and commentators said, no, he thinks that he can just pick up his [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=213.9s)]
*  phone and things get fixed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=218.22s)]
*  Well, lo and behold, things have already started to happen before he actually has the power [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=219.9s)]
*  as president. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=224.5s)]
*  A couple of things. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=225.5s)]
*  In Springfield, Ohio, the Haitian migrants are beginning to go to sanctuary cities. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=226.5s)]
*  Number two is there's been arrest of the Aurora Venezuelan gangsters in New York City. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=230.18s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=234.94s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=235.94s)]
*  Yeah, so we'll see. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=236.94s)]
*  Now suddenly it's not cool to be a gangster. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxI3CwMN8k&t=237.94s)]
