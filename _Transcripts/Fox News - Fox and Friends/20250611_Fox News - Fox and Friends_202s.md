# BREAKING: Elon Musk admits regret for Trump attacks in big, beautiful 'backtrack'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js)
*  Also new overnight Elon Musk backtracking. It's called the big beautiful backtrack. He tweeted this out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=0.0s)]
*  He said I regret some of my posts about President Donald Trump last week. They went too far [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=7.32s)]
*  He didn't say which one specifically that he regretted. We have some ideas you and read through him Brian [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=13.64s)]
*  It says without me Trump would have lost the election [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=19.16s)]
*  Not a good thing to say Dems would control the house and Republicans would be down 51 49 in the Senate [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  Really not accurate, but you did put a lot of time in Pennsylvania Elon. We know that [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=27.5s)]
*  He said this as well in light of the president's statements about the cancellation of my government contracts [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=32.940000000000005s)]
*  They sex will begin but the Commissioner is dragging spacecraft immediately and that's been deleted [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=38.06s)]
*  He also said time to drop the really big bomb [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=43.260000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day DJT [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  These are our opinion of what he might want to we don't know what he wants to walk back [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  Was deleted too. So yeah, he also said that Donald Trump should be impeached. Yeah [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=55.739999999999995s)]
*  Anybody that knows the president he loves spirited debate [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=62.099999999999994s)]
*  Even if you disagree with him, you can yell you can scream you can make your points be heard [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=65.1s)]
*  But when he took it public and he started saying some of the talking points from the left where it was impeachment [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=70.14s)]
*  Epstein files and all that he lost a little credibility or a lot of credibility now [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=76.69999999999999s)]
*  I think they will make up but they're never gonna be as close as they were before because the president simply can't trust the guy [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=81.78s)]
*  Now Donald Trump said that he he thinks that he imagines that Elon Musk would want to talk to him. Listen [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=88.3s)]
*  On Elon Musk, do you plan to speak to him on the phone anytime soon? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=95.18s)]
*  I haven't really thought about it. Actually, I would imagine he wants to speak to me [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=100.62s)]
*  I would think that if I were him, I'd want to speak to me [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=105.48s)]
*  But and maybe he was already called you'd have to ask him ask him whether or not he's already called but [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=108.56s)]
*  I'd have no problem with it [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  You did what does that mean? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=117.4s)]
*  I think he said hey, he called me but I'm not gonna put it out there. Did you ask him? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=119.44s)]
*  I don't know for sure but I would say I'd have everything that he posted [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=123.0s)]
*  You know what bothers him most the attacks on the big beautiful bill because it hurt it [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=126.38s)]
*  Temporarily a whole it halted the momentum they had in the Senate. So now he's got wait [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=130.88s)]
*  This is my landmark piece of legislation you better not hurt it [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=136.23999999999998s)]
*  Remember he blew up the debt ceiling deal that was done so they could move forward and it delayed everything for two weeks [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=139.12s)]
*  Everyday matters. They got three weeks to get it done [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  And I think that if they could just Elon could just stay out of the way and let the politics [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  Happen and the bill be defined the president would be more than willing to talk out after July 4th [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=152.2s)]
*  I definitely think they will make up you have a guy who is used to leading a company a massive company [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=158.12s)]
*  Wealthiest man in the world. He's not used to being told what to do. He's used to doing the firing [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=163.84s)]
*  but in this case [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  He's dealing with the most powerful man in the world. And so I think that there was frustration in his skis [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=169.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and he's be curial. He's you know, he's a different kind of person. So [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=175.83999999999997s)]
*  There's no way to turn it. He can't go Democrat everything that they were he has come out [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=181.88s)]
*  He won't go Democrat. He just didn't like the bill because it wasn't in his best interest for his company. I'm Steve juicy [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO-50e5_js&t=186.88s)]
