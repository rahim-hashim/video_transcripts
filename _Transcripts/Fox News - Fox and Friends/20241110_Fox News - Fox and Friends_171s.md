# SWING STATE SWEEP: Trump seals victory with Arizona win
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g)
*  All right, we begin the 8 o'clock hour with our final call of the 2024 presidential race. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=0.0s)]
*  This might be the first time you're hearing it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=5.2s)]
*  As president-elect, Trump has officially flipped Arizona, adding to his historic win. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=7.04s)]
*  Trump sweeping all seven battleground states, lifting his total number of electoral college [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  votes to 312, the most won by a GOP presidential candidate since 1988. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  That was before I graduated from high school. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=24.88s)]
*  Here it comes as the White House announces Trump and Biden will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=27.36s)]
*  And as Trump begins his transition to the White House, we know two names who won't be joining him. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=33.76s)]
*  Former Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, and former Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=39.12s)]
*  Trump posting to Truth Social yesterday that he will not be inviting the two while thanking them [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  for their previous work. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=50.4s)]
*  Haley responding on X saying, quote, I was proud to work with President Trump defending America [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=52.4s)]
*  at the United Nations. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=56.72s)]
*  I wish him and all who serve great success in moving us forward to a stronger, safer America [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=57.6s)]
*  over the next four years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=63.2s)]
*  Former Ambassador to Germany and one-time Acting Director of National Intelligence, Rick Brunel, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=65.12s)]
*  could be joining Trump's cabinet. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=70.64s)]
*  He's rumored to be in the running for Secretary of State. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=72.8s)]
*  And Trump's return to the White House could bring changes to the FBI. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=77.36s)]
*  While Christopher Wray has the job until 2027, he could choose to step down or Trump could [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=80.48s)]
*  replace him before the end of his term. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=85.44s)]
*  Yeah, Rick Brunel is certainly a name to pay attention to. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=89.28s)]
*  I think he's on, I've heard him on a lot of quarters. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=92.32s)]
*  He's got a lot of support inside the new administration. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=95.44s)]
*  And that tweet, that tweet or that post by Truth by President Trump about Haley and Pompeo [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=98.64s)]
*  was a surprise because usually you don't post who is out. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=106.32s)]
*  But not, I mean, it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=110.08s)]
*  So why did he do that? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=111.28s)]
*  Because I think there was some public speculation about positions for both of them that he [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=113.28s)]
*  probably wanted to end. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  I also think, you know, in the case of Nikki Haley, obviously was a political opponent. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=118.56s)]
*  In the case of Mike Pompeo, there were some things that surfaced that he had said in 2023 [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  when he was thinking about running. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=126.72s)]
*  You know, when you're thinking about being a candidate, you take a different approach, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=128.8s)]
*  which Trump world has taken issue with as well. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=131.52s)]
*  So interesting development, but not totally surprising. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=134.32s)]
*  I had heard from, you know, read some things from people saying, you know, if he wanted [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=137.2s)]
*  to show unity, he should reach out to that wing of the party, that sort of neocon wing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=141.6s)]
*  of the party. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=147.12s)]
*  But there was a lot of pushback from the base, as you said, when those names started floating. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=147.92s)]
*  And so he put an end to all the speculation saying, don't worry, I'm not doing these two. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  And you see other names popping forward. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=157.44s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=160.16s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy3x5BTth5g&t=161.12s)]
