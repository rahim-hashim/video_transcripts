# Coast Guard: ‘Praying and hoping’ as dozens of kids remain missing in Texas floods
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A)
*  All right, we now want to focus on the rescue mission and joining us now from the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=0.0s)]
*  in Corpus Christi is Lieutenant Ian Hopper, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=5.84s)]
*  AMT-3 Seth Reeves, Lieutenant Blair Ogujafor, and AST-3 Scott Ruskin. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=8.94s)]
*  Thank you all so much for joining us and for helping out in this mission to find these [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  23 young little girls and the families who are also impacted by the storm. So [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=20.78s)]
*  Lieutenant Hopper, I'll start with you. How is the Coast Guard responding to this flood in Texas right now? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=25.52s)]
*  Good morning. Yeah, so primarily we're using our helicopter assets. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=33.04s)]
*  So the MH-65 [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=38.48s)]
*  Echo is primarily a maritime search and rescue asset. So we're used to going offshore. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=40.56s)]
*  But right now we are using it for [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=47.04s)]
*  inland search and rescue. So [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=49.6s)]
*  operating using our hoist capability or just landing and picking people up and transiting them [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=52.08s)]
*  in the MH-65 Dolphin. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=59.68s)]
*  So, I don't know who's best to answer this question, but you all figure that out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=62.24s)]
*  You know, obviously you look at the video, you see these incredible flood waters, you see the incredible efforts [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=66.8s)]
*  to rescue people and hundreds of people have been rescued. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=73.2s)]
*  What are the additional [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=76.8s)]
*  complications that you all have to deal with? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=78.86s)]
*  That you have to kind of, you know, obviously you have a lot of people who want, you know, civilians who want to help out, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=82.24s)]
*  but you don't want them to get in the way. What are the additional [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=86.88s)]
*  complications that you want to kind of warn [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=91.97999999999999s)]
*  civilians about not getting in your way? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well there's a lot of different complications. Primarily a lot of civilians are [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  where we were all operating on the same frequency when we were flying. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=106.8s)]
*  Additional complications would be, so Scott here, he's our rescue swimmer and he, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=112.48s)]
*  you can explain a little bit. Yeah, kind of what's going on on the ground. Yeah, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=117.84s)]
*  a lot of times what's happening is, yeah, everyone wants to do as much as they can to help out and we truly appreciate that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=122.08s)]
*  But sometimes they don't always have the best communication. So most biggest thing is just trying to pass stuff off to the higher level of care. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=127.84s)]
*  Pass it up through the chain about who's where, who needs help. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=134.72s)]
*  And then you can get, you know, like a government agency out there to try to help you out as fast as we can. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=139.36s)]
*  And then we can triage from there and kind of get people the safety. But most important thing is staying out of the river, super dangerous. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=144.0s)]
*  And keep yourself safe before you put yourself in a more dangerous situation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  All right, when we look at this current scenario with nearly two dozen young girls that are missing, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=154.72s)]
*  what scenario exists that they can be found alive? Have they, you know, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=160.8s)]
*  could they have just been swept away and are, you know, hanging on to a tree? Is there any [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=164.72s)]
*  scenario you see where they can be found alive? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=170.0s)]
*  You know, that's, of course, that's a hard question to answer, but ultimately there's multiple [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=175.6s)]
*  assets, crews out there, both Coast Guard, you've got the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=183.52s)]
*  Army out there, you've got DPS, the Department of Public Safety for Texas. So [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  we're giving everyone the best chance that they've got. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=196.4s)]
*  And really working as a team, as a team in Texas here to, yeah, give anyone who's still out there the best shot. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=200.56s)]
*  Yeah, Lieutenant Agudjufour, anybody else you could chime in with stories as well if you've heard them. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  But what are some of the stories that people are telling you who you have rescued? What are they saying about their experience? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=213.28s)]
*  So personally, I haven't been able to speak with anyone. I know we [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  landed yesterday and then we also had to take the new crews out to give them a fam flight of the area. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=224.88s)]
*  But some of our crews that stayed back, they did get to see a couple of the girls that we actually took in our aircraft. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=230.72s)]
*  You know, reunited with their families. So I know, and the folks at the hotel too, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=238.24s)]
*  they had a mother who approached them and was like, thank you so much, my daughter is alive [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=243.44s)]
*  because you guys were able to assist her today. So [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=248.24s)]
*  I mean, I can only imagine that they're grateful when we were picking up folks, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=252.08s)]
*  have, you know, young girls who are asking, you know, about if we knew where their siblings were. And, you know, at that point [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=256.24s)]
*  we're just trying to get and help those who we can assist. And yeah, just praying and hoping that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=261.76s)]
*  folks are able to get reunited with their families. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=267.76s)]
*  So Scott, when you do, when you all do hear from people [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=270.32s)]
*  that need rescuing, what is the most common way that, do you just find them or are people able to reach out with phones? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=274.88s)]
*  And what's the most common way that they contact you to let you know that they need help? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=282.56s)]
*  Yeah, as far as right now, we've been getting our casks from higher up, mostly from the Army as of right now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=289.68s)]
*  But a lot of it's just been large-stage triaging. So we were at Mystic yesterday for a long period of time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  Probably got about 200 people out of there alone and it was just, yeah, we just saw [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  a huge crowd of about 200 kids at a campsite. So we're like, cool, that's where we're, that's where we're going to go. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  And we're just going to get as many people out as we can until they were all gone. They were all, we all got them all out yesterday at Mystic. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=310.64s)]
*  So, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=315.84s)]
*  Wow. Listen, first and foremost, we know this isn't easy for you all. You're doing God's work out there [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  and sometimes results aren't what you want them to be. It's rescue and recovery. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=323.28s)]
*  And we just want you to know we're praying for you and we thank God every day that there are people like you out there [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=327.44s)]
*  who are willing to show up and do this, even on the tough days. So thank you so much. God bless you all. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=332.0s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. Thank you for what you're doing. We appreciate it. And Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick yesterday, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=337.12s)]
*  he said that he wants everybody to get down on their knees and pray that these [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=342.48s)]
*  little girls are found alive. And when I read that, I did that. And I think that a lot of other people are going to be doing [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=346.96s)]
*  that and praying [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93wME0NEh8A&t=351.92s)]
