# 'NOT THE WINNING COALITION': MSNBC hosts slams Dem strategy of lifting up of 'Never Trumpers'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ)
*  German crats are looking at all this and the coalition they built to try to win an election and failed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Miserably and saying well, where did we fail? Jen Psaki says and we brought on all these right-wingers [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  We brought on Liz chain and we brought on never never Trumpers and that's just not a winning coalition [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=10.46s)]
*  There were many headwinds here. There is sexism there's racism all of that is true [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=16.52s)]
*  But I also think there is a real question [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=22.0s)]
*  I hope people start looking at about who people are listening to in my view [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=25.02s)]
*  There was an over listening to and an over lifting up of people who left Trump not people who left the Democratic Party [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=29.6s)]
*  The people who left the Democratic Party are the people who are going to be lit [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=36.72s)]
*  You know win in the future the people who left Trump the never Trumpers who have important voices and have [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=40.82s)]
*  That is not the winning coalition and I think that is a takeaway [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=46.88s)]
*  You know what? I'm gonna say Jen Psaki has a point [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=51.28s)]
*  I think a lot of Democrats including her wanted to believe that there was this huge, you know contingency of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=54.04s)]
*  Never Trumpers and it wasn't true. Most Republicans [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=61.2s)]
*  85-95% of them were with Trump the whole time [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=66.6s)]
*  but they saw Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney and and and Adam Kinsinger and they wrapped their arms around them and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=69.64s)]
*  And this was a huge mistake because war was on war versus peace was on the ballot [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  Whether the polls were talking about it or not [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=82.68s)]
*  it was an undercurrent on the right people were sick of of the stupid wars and the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=84.8s)]
*  Neocons that were putting us in those wars and and there were a lot of young men that didn't want [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=91.48s)]
*  What that what that lady right there Liz Cheney was selling and they embraced Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=96.68s)]
*  And I think that was a boon for for Donald Trump. He was like great. You can have her we got RFK [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=103.08s)]
*  That's the art of the deal by the way that trade RFK and Tulsi for for dick and this Cheney, you know [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=108.28s)]
*  I value independent thought so I'm not talking about independent thought when I say this but this idea of never Trumpism [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=114.28s)]
*  Has been one of the most failed movements in American political history and competes with BLM [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=120.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's right there with BLM like the Lincoln project and BLM [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=125.28s)]
*  Yeah, some of the most biggest failures in American political history [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=129.32s)]
*  And now as you can hear from Jen Psaki, they're basically being ostracized by the team [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=133.48s)]
*  They attempted to adopt and that's Democrats [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=138.1s)]
*  And so that entire wing of whatever what one point was Republicans then was Democrats is a land without a home. I mean [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=140.2s)]
*  Where does Liz Cheney go from here? What where is Liz Cheney's home? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=146.76s)]
*  Well, it's just like whereas it was but it's also to your point the neokind side of things [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=151.92s)]
*  Like where is Nikki Haley's home, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  People were clamoring Oh Nikki Haley needs to endorse she he needs to use her. He's like I don't need Nikki Haley [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=159.0s)]
*  I'm gonna win without her. So I do think that whole [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  Interventionist wing is without a home and for good reason because of the the chaos that it wrought [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=166.11999999999998s)]
*  It's on both sides such a good point. They said you need Nikki Haley to win women [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  Guess what Donald Trump won white women without Nikki Haley's on and you know why part of it was maha by the way [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=175.32s)]
*  There you know, there was this idea that women only vote on abortion and they all want, you know reproductive freedom [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=181.83999999999997s)]
*  There were a lot of pro-life women, but there are also women who on their daily lives [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=187.26s)]
*  They deal with food and feeding their families and they love the message for Make America Healthy Again and the chronic disease that they see [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=191.9s)]
*  Overtaking, you know this country so Donald Trump was hitting different points [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=199.5s)]
*  And by the way delicious to see Dick Cheney and and Liz Cheney being blamed for the loss [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=203.84s)]
*  Although I think it's an unfair total blame [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=209.64s)]
*  There's a lot to go around to watch Jen Psaki say what was actually racism and misogyny, of course up front [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=213.34s)]
*  So there's been a quadruple down on that Pete this week they've even discussions that Latino men are racist and black men are misogynist [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=218.8s)]
*  So they're gonna quadruple down on what got them a loss in this election [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=226.0s)]
*  And that is according to Stephen a Smith of ESPN who was this week on the Will Cain show talking about all this culture war [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=229.24s)]
*  And identity politics is how you ended up where you are Democrats. I [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=236.2s)]
*  Acknowledged we got a new president [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=240.92s)]
*  He romped her and American people have spoken you can say what you want [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=243.36s)]
*  But this country has said we went too far left [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=248.76s)]
*  Enough's enough. We got to stop this nonsense. It's about our pocketbooks and it's about safety [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=252.72s)]
*  Period and if you don't like it get over it majority of American people said look, it's the economy stupid [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=260.64s)]
*  It's immigration. It's crime in the streets and it's such a strong tilt to the progressive left where we're talking about [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=267.88s)]
*  Transgender issues and and culture wars and identity politics and all of this stuff [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=276.29999999999995s)]
*  We're sick of all of that, even though I didn't vote for him [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=281.7s)]
*  I'm not is taking a back and feeling like nothing but gloom and doom and the world is coming to an end [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=285.5s)]
*  Because the person that I voted for didn't win [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=292.17999999999995s)]
*  It's not misogyny to care about putting food on the table [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=295.7s)]
*  I was really insulted as you know as an American [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=299.24s)]
*  The what they said about Latino man and black man, it's like are you kidding me? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=302.38000000000005s)]
*  Like these are men going I care about putting food on it's really hard to be a provider and it for being a provider is [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=306.94000000000005s)]
*  What gives men their self-esteem which gives them their dignity and it was hard to do it under this economy because everything was so expensive [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=313.70000000000005s)]
*  Do you know 80% of Hispanics? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=321.1s)]
*  Felt like they were it was hard [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=324.1s)]
*  They said they worried about going about putting food on the table 80% of them [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=326.3s)]
*  You're a misogynist because you care about that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=330.7s)]
*  It was so and so the way they've responded to this has been absolutely terrible something to pay attention to here because even a Smith is [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  Talking about the culture aspect of how Democrats are pushing all this politically correct social justice garbage [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=339.88s)]
*  Watch when Trump says we're ending transgenderism in the military watch when Trump says no more transgenders and women's sports [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=346.70000000000005s)]
*  What does the left do do they give in and say you know what? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=354.04s)]
*  We went too far or do they double down and say no [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=357.7s)]
*  Those are our brothers and sisters in the trans community who have to defend it and take to the streets over trans [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=360.94s)]
*  It's it's in some ways a trap for them the right thing to do for Trump [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=366.14s)]
*  But which at which way do they go that's that still remains to be seen they may double down [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=370.02s)]
*  Well, I asked I asked Stephen a did not a lot of this [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh05DXUi3OQ&t=374.58s)]
