# Judge who halted Trump deportation fights assigned Signal leak case
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU)
*  The judge who issued the restraining temporary order in those deportation flights [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=0.0s)]
*  has now been randomly circled out on your scorecard at home [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=5.5s)]
*  assigned a case regarding the signal chat leak and an investigation that would follow. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=9.5s)]
*  It's really incredible. Watchdog Group is suing Trump officials [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=14.5s)]
*  involving in discussion on plans to strike the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=18.0s)]
*  Chandley Painter is here with more on this. Hi Chandley. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=22.5s)]
*  Hey, good morning. So the assignment of that judge, James Boasberg, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=25.5s)]
*  garnering criticism from Republican lawmakers who say the federal judges' rulings are clearly biased [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=29.0s)]
*  against the Trump administration. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=35.0s)]
*  Trump himself saying this quote, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=37.0s)]
*  Judge James Boasberg has just been given a fourth Trump case, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=39.0s)]
*  something which is statistically impossible. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=44.0s)]
*  There is no way for a Republican, especially a Trump Republican, to win before him. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=47.0s)]
*  He is highly conflicted. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=52.5s)]
*  And this case was filed Wednesday by the government Watchdog Group, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=54.5s)]
*  alleging that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others violated federal records laws [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=58.5s)]
*  by discussing Houthi attack plans in a signal group chat. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=65.0s)]
*  President Trump is standing by his team and blaming the app. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=69.5s)]
*  It's all a witch hunt. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=73.5s)]
*  Here we are talking about some of the greatest business deals ever made. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=75.5s)]
*  The greatest companies in the world are moving into the United States. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=79.5s)]
*  And you want to ask about whether or not signal works. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=82.5s)]
*  I don't know that signal works. I think signal could be defective, to be honest with you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=85.5s)]
*  And now the White House has appointed Elon Musk and his team at Doge [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=89.5s)]
*  to help investigate how a journalist was included on that encrypted messaging app group chat [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=94.5s)]
*  with national security officials. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=100.5s)]
*  Meantime, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke to reporters, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=102.5s)]
*  emphasizing it was a policy discussion and that no classified information was shared in the chat. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=106.5s)]
*  Nobody's texting war plans. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=113.5s)]
*  There's no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=115.5s)]
*  You know who sees war plans? I see them. Every single day. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=126.5s)]
*  And the president has also said he will ask Secretary Hegseth to review what kinds of information should be considered classified. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=132.5s)]
*  Thank you so much, Chaley. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=140.5s)]
*  And if I'm the administration, you've been more than outgoing about this and speaking to the press. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=142.5s)]
*  I think it's done. Take Brit Yume's advice last night. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=148.5s)]
*  This is done. We're doing an internal investigation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=151.5s)]
*  We're going to address our group chats in different ways, where we're in different locations. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=154.5s)]
*  Ideally, we're going to be in the Situation Room. We're going to look to move forward. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=157.5s)]
*  I'd like an investigation. I actually don't believe that they know how J.G. got in. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=161.5s)]
*  Got in to the group chat. That's worthy of an investigation. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=169.5s)]
*  Michael Waltz says, I'm ultimately responsible. I don't think there's any possible way. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=172.5s)]
*  He loaded that thing in himself, judging by his workload. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=177.5s)]
*  But once they were talking, I don't think you can blame Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth because there's nothing wrong with the communication. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=180.5s)]
*  He was told it was secure. End of story. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=187.5s)]
*  Well, I think also when you look at the press conference yesterday in the Oval, the president has clearly moved on. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=190.5s)]
*  I mean, it seems like the media wants to continue to talk to him. And I understand it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=198.5s)]
*  We like to socialize things. But I think the president is trying to push forward. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=202.5s)]
*  Also, it's become very clear that Pete is the Secretary of Defense Hegseth is the target of Democrats. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=208.5s)]
*  They want him to resign. They want him gone. And he's not even the guy that put the chat together. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=215.5s)]
*  But he was the target from day one. They never wanted him to be confirmed. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=221.5s)]
*  They're only asking him to resign. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=225.5s)]
*  Look at the operation. The military operation was flawless. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=227.5s)]
*  It was great. No one died. But the enemy. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=230.5s)]
*  Exactly. But here's the thing. It is on all the other channels and all the other papers. It's a lead story. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=233.5s)]
*  Initially, the president, very angry that it happened because it was a stupid mistake. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=241.5s)]
*  Although it is unknown publicly what exactly happened. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=246.5s)]
*  Because the president would like to be talking about something else right now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=251.5s)]
*  He'd like to be talking about the tariffs. He'd like to be talking about the border. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=256.5s)]
*  He'd like to be talking about anything other than how his cabinet screwed up. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=259.5s)]
*  During the first administration, somebody already would have been fired at this point. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=263.5s)]
*  But Trump wants to make this cabinet, this term, different. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=268.5s)]
*  And so he's giving them a little... He's letting the critics hammer the cabinet. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=274.5s)]
*  And it doesn't look like he's going to change his mind at this point. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=280.5s)]
*  Listen, the president is doing a good job of not furthering the story. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=283.5s)]
*  Which is what you were referring to with Brit Hume's advice. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=285.5s)]
*  Because yesterday, during the press conference over 25% tariffs on auto imports, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=288.5s)]
*  obviously the first few questions are going to be about the signal thing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=294.5s)]
*  And he was as calm as I've ever seen him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=297.5s)]
*  And he said, listen, we're trying to get to the bottom of this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=300.5s)]
*  Elon Musk is going to be doing an investigation into how all of this happened. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=303.5s)]
*  Don't blame Pete. Somebody said should he be fired? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=307.5s)]
*  He didn't do anything wrong. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=309.5s)]
*  This is a government-sanctioned chat app that is secure. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=310.5s)]
*  And the Biden administration used it. Now we're using it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=315.5s)]
*  Maybe we won't anymore because this happened. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=318.5s)]
*  But I don't even know. I don't even... [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=320.5s)]
*  I am not convinced that this was even a mistake by Mike Waltz. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=322.5s)]
*  Because when he spoke to Laura Ingraham, he seemed as confused as anybody else. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=327.5s)]
*  And I believe him. I know him. He's a smart and capable man. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=331.5s)]
*  And what he seemed to think is that he's never met Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=335.5s)]
*  He doesn't have his phone number. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=339.5s)]
*  So could somebody have put Jeffrey Goldberg's phone number under somebody else's name in his phone? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=341.5s)]
*  That wouldn't be his fault. He would be the victim there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=349.5s)]
*  So that's what this investigation... [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=352.5s)]
*  You know, I would say, Carly, for here on in, I would say this. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=353.5s)]
*  We still haven't figured it out yet, but we've got to move on. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=355.5s)]
*  And I'll tell you, the Houthi Rebels thing was a significant hit. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=357.5s)]
*  I came in and I'm reading the papers. It's buried on page 12. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=360.5s)]
*  I'm like, wait a second. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=364.5s)]
*  Fifty-three people died. They actually hit commanders. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=365.5s)]
*  The big message that was sent, are we going to be able to get through that waterway? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=367.5s)]
*  And I was like, well, no one cares. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=370.5s)]
*  The international press didn't care. The local press didn't care. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=371.5s)]
*  Not one question. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=375.5s)]
*  Now they care about the operation because they can see blood in the water. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=376.5s)]
*  I almost said smell. I adjusted. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=379.5s)]
*  They could smell blood. And they want to do the... [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=381.5s)]
*  They're doing the Russia play. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=383.5s)]
*  If you look at the other channels, it's the same thing. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=385.5s)]
*  All different waves of how we're doing it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=387.5s)]
*  And then yesterday, I got a call. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=390.5s)]
*  They're trying to find out what other devices these people in the White House have that might be open source. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=392.5s)]
*  Do they still have their text messages? Do they still have their Venmo? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=399.5s)]
*  So they're trying to make something look as though these guys and these women have not made the transition to the government. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=402.5s)]
*  Good luck with that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=409.5s)]
*  The American people are not going to fall for another three-year Russia investigation. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=410.5s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=415.5s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3atSYMAI2RU&t=416.5s)]
