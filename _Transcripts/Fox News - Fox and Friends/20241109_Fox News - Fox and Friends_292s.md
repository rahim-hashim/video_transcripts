# CNN analyst claims Harris lost because the media was not on her side
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q)
*  A CNN political analyst claims Vice President Harris lost the election because the media [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=0.0s)]
*  wasn't on her side. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=6.34s)]
*  Maybe it's not so much Democrats' policies or messaging or the words that they use specifically, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=9.9s)]
*  but there is an entire right-wing media ecosystem that doesn't exist on the left. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=15.74s)]
*  It does not exist in the center or mainstream, and people are getting their information in [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=20.14s)]
*  very different ways now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=24.46s)]
*  Control. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=26.22s)]
*  They're all, yes, yes, yes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=27.22s)]
*  I'm here to react to his president of district media group and a fellow at the Independent [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=29.200000000000003s)]
*  Women's Forum, Beverly Hallberg. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=34.0s)]
*  Beverly, good morning to you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=35.68s)]
*  This is pretty amazing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=37.52s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=38.52s)]
*  It's reminiscent of the 90s when it's like we don't control talk radio and therefore [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=39.52s)]
*  that's why we lose everything. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=43.900000000000006s)]
*  Isn't it the case though they control every other form of media outside of Fox News and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=45.16s)]
*  podcasts and talk radio? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=51.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=54.14s)]
*  Yeah, and absolutely. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=55.14s)]
*  And this is projection at its finest because the reality is that Donald Trump won this [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=56.62s)]
*  presidency in spite of a liberal media ecosystem that comprises of news and sports and social [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=60.419999999999995s)]
*  media and Hollywood. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=67.1s)]
*  And I think as we look at this, we also have to combine that with the fact that they covered [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  up for Joe Biden and his mental decline. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=73.52s)]
*  They also did a complete rewrite of Kamala Harris saying somebody who was a very unpopular [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=75.72s)]
*  VP all of a sudden was a political superstar. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=80.74s)]
*  So as you see this Monday morning quarterbacking, these autopsies going on, the question I ask [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=83.83999999999999s)]
*  myself is this purely just trying to deflect from the blame that they should actually take [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  on themselves or is it something more insidious? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=94.36s)]
*  Is this something because of their moral superiority, their arrogance where they can't even see [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=96.96s)]
*  the truth anymore because they're so blinded? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the boogeyman, as Will pointed out, was Rush Limbaugh. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=104.72s)]
*  It's been Fox News and now it's going to be X and Joe Rogan. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=108.32s)]
*  You know, in their mind, you can't tolerate dissent. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=111.53999999999999s)]
*  So where does this critique go for them? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=114.02s)]
*  Does it say, hey, we need to have our own or we need to shut them down or what's their [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=116.34s)]
*  instinct? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=120.02s)]
*  Well, I think their instinct is going to be to claim that these they need to be shut down. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=122.17999999999999s)]
*  And of course, that's why they're so afraid of a Donald Trump presidency because they [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  don't think they're going to get the censorship they want. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=130.06s)]
*  But they would go a long way if they did a little introspection and realize one of the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=132.42s)]
*  reasons why Joe Rogan has been so popular, and by the way, he's a moderate, is because he [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=136.84s)]
*  actually was curious. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  He actually would speak to anyone, even in the past week he had on Senator John Fetterman on [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=143.0s)]
*  his show. It's not that he's only interviewing Republicans on his show. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  And if liberals actually got back to asking questions, being curious, not running to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=152.4s)]
*  knee-jerk name calling such as fascist and racist and misogynist, I think they might [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=157.84s)]
*  actually see a little traction. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=164.1s)]
*  But the reality is, I don't think they really want to connect with voters. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=165.85999999999999s)]
*  They don't want to know why a large swath of the American people from all demographics [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=169.14s)]
*  actually helped Donald Trump win. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=174.26s)]
*  I frankly think the American voter, the American people are tired of left leaning media [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=176.54s)]
*  because they know that they've been gaslit, that they've been lied to for so many years. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  You know, Joe Rogan asked Kamala Harris to go on his show and she refused to go on. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=186.1s)]
*  Look at this coverage, because this is what I find remarkable. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=191.44s)]
*  Will is right. They not only control most of the most of the media outside of podcasts, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  Fox News and talk radio, but their coverage is so overwhelmingly negative on Donald Trump [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=199.28s)]
*  and so positive. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  And then you add to that that they control the university system, so many pillars of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  culture, Hollywood. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=212.83999999999997s)]
*  And then they also controlled, you know, they weaponized the government about Donald [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=214.6s)]
*  Trump. I can't imagine what this election would have looked like, Beverly, if they had [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=218.22s)]
*  been fair on any of those things that I just mentioned. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=223.42s)]
*  It's it's truly remarkable what Donald Trump has overcome. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=226.26s)]
*  It's it's a it's a it's an epic story, actually. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=229.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a big turning point in this country where even if you were called [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=235.17999999999998s)]
*  racist and garbage and, of course, there were the basket of deplorables from years ago, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=238.66s)]
*  I even think the era of covid where Americans were called that part of the reason we have [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=243.06s)]
*  this pandemic. I think the name calling doesn't work. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=247.84s)]
*  It's not that someone who is a racist isn't a horrible thing, but people don't believe [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=251.14000000000001s)]
*  they're that because everybody is called that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=255.82s)]
*  These terms have lost their meaning. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=258.3s)]
*  And I think another part of this is when you're told that the economy is fine, that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=260.46s)]
*  inflation is transitory, not that bad, that President Joe Biden is running circles around [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=264.9s)]
*  his staff. People know that that doesn't match with reality. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  They don't trust legacy media anymore. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=272.42s)]
*  Joe running circles around his staff. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=275.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvW-dUP7Q&t=277.34s)]
