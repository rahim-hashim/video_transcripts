# 'WAR ZONE': Mother of Rachel Morin speaks out on dangers from border crisis
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE)
*  Former President Donald Trump putting a spotlight on migrant crime at his Arizona rally while [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=0.0s)]
*  honoring the family of Rachel Moran, a Maryland mother of five allegedly murdered by an illegal [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=6.08s)]
*  immigrant. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=11.16s)]
*  Yesterday, I was at the border with the victims of Kamala's migrant crime wave. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=12.16s)]
*  One of them is here with us tonight. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=20.0s)]
*  Michael Moran is the brother of Rachel Moran, who you know about. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=22.28s)]
*  Rachel was a cherished 37-year-old mom of five. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=26.08s)]
*  Michael, I promise you, in Rachel's memory, we will stop this invasion and we will keep [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  these savage criminals to hell out of our country. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=35.56s)]
*  Let's begin with Rachel Moran's mother, Patty Moran, who joins us right now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=40.48s)]
*  Patty, thank you for being here with us. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=44.28s)]
*  I know you have told your story, but you and I haven't personally spoken, so let me just [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=46.44s)]
*  begin by saying how sorry I am. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  You have my personal thoughts and prayers, as I know everyone here at Fox feels the same [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=53.36s)]
*  way for you and your family. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=57.68s)]
*  I would love to ask you, while you've told your story, you've made another choice to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=59.74s)]
*  share your story, and not just share your story on television, but share it as a family [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=63.88s)]
*  with Donald Trump from the stage at a political rally. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=69.12s)]
*  I'm curious why this was important for you and your family. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=73.08s)]
*  It was important for us because I wanted Americans to know that this is an American [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=78.7s)]
*  issue, that this is, yes, it's a political thing that's going on at the moment, but it's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=85.22s)]
*  also beyond politics, it's endangering American families. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  And until I went to the border, well, first off, Mr. Trump, he actually is a very compassionate [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=100.0s)]
*  man, and he really cares about us as a family, and he really cares about how immigration [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=107.96s)]
*  is affecting American families. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=115.88s)]
*  And but I didn't realize until I went to the border just how dangerous the border was and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  how much information the American people don't actually know about the border and the numbers [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=127.16s)]
*  coming over. And it's literally like a war zone. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=133.44s)]
*  And the majority of American people don't even know how dangerous it really is. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=137.54000000000002s)]
*  And what is it you think the American people don't know? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=141.9s)]
*  If you had to say, like, the most revealing thing that you have learned, sadly, through [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  this process that is escaping the attention of Americans, what would that be? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=149.86s)]
*  I would say that the number of families affected. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=155.26000000000002s)]
*  You see a few families that are highlighted on the news, like our family and Kayla and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  even Amanda that was there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=168.84s)]
*  But there are literally tens of thousands of families that have been affected by this [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=171.44s)]
*  illegal immigration that don't hit the newswaves or, you know, women are raped and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=177.0s)]
*  assaulted, but it doesn't end in murder. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=185.6s)]
*  And so their story never even hits the news. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=188.18s)]
*  Up where I live, there was a woman that came up to me because she knew I was Rachel's mom. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=193.06s)]
*  And she told me that someone came up from behind her, grabbed her around the neck and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=197.94s)]
*  had tried pulling her to the ground. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=204.29999999999998s)]
*  And she said that she fought him off, ran to a nearby store, called the police. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  And it turned out that this person had attacked seven other women. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=212.08s)]
*  You don't hear that in the news, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=216.36s)]
*  It's it's more prevalent than people realize. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=218.32s)]
*  Of course, this is a really very dangerous thing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=221.96s)]
*  Of course, people have come to to know the names like your daughter, Rachel Morin, Jocelyn [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=225.16s)]
*  Nunn-Garray, Lizbeth Medina, Ruby Garcia, Jeremy Casares, Lakin Riley. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=230.04s)]
*  But you point out all the others who don't make the news. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=236.68s)]
*  I'd love to ask you one last thing. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=239.04s)]
*  You said almost as an aside at the beginning of our conversation, you said a lot of people [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=240.4s)]
*  don't also realize that Mr. Trump is a very compassionate man. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=245.9s)]
*  Again, you've I think importantly told us today it's not just a political issue, it's an [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  American issue. And obviously for you, it's a personal issue. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=253.3s)]
*  How did you personally experience the compassion of President Trump? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=256.02s)]
*  He reached out. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=261.94s)]
*  Well, first off off, in the scheme of things, we're we're nothing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=263.74s)]
*  I mean, you have celebrities, you have politicians. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=270.12s)]
*  I'm just, you know, a retired old woman that works part time. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=273.44s)]
*  We're just the normal American. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=278.52000000000004s)]
*  And to have someone that has power and has influence to actually take time out of his [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  schedule to reach out to us, to give us his condolences and not just once, but he has [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  followed up many times to support our family. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=294.92s)]
*  And I know the families of others where Biden and Harris, we haven't even gotten a call [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=297.85999999999996s)]
*  from them and they don't they haven't even acknowledged Rachel, her name, or that it's [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=304.58s)]
*  their responsibility because it's a border issue. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=312.46s)]
*  And just because you deny reality and you denying truth, it doesn't change the reality or [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=316.38s)]
*  the truth of the situation. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=325.05999999999995s)]
*  It just proves you're a liar. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=326.96s)]
*  Well, Patty, referring to Biden, Harris, I don't think you're just a part time retired [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=329.08s)]
*  old woman. I think you're a beautiful human who suffered through something incredibly [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=334.64s)]
*  sad. You're an American and I think anyone, most notably President Trump, can recognize [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=338.64s)]
*  how important a person you are. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=342.84s)]
*  We appreciate you sharing your story with us this morning. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=344.4s)]
*  Thank you so much. All right. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=347.08s)]
*  And most compelling analysis. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5wbgKCwUE&t=356.46s)]
