# 'POWER OF PRAYER': Christian leader urges everyone to come together for Israel
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA)
*  This weekend, Jewish and Christian leaders around the world are bringing their congregations together for a historic weekend of prayer for the people of Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=0.0s)]
*  Last week, leading members of Congress introduced a bipartisan resolution calling for the gesture after hundreds of thousands gathered on the National Mall in D.C. to show their support for the Jewish community. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=8.34s)]
*  Our next guest is the National Director of the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem, USA and the executive director of the American Christian Leaders for Israel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Dr. Susan Michael joins us now. Dr. thanks for being here. Explain for our audience why you believe this is so important. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  Well, I was there in the rally on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. and it was fantastic. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=35.76s)]
*  And it is so important that Christians stand up at this time and we show up at the rallies. We speak out in support of Israel so that the Jewish community knows that they are not alone. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=43.08s)]
*  They feel very alone at this point. The world points a finger at Israel for everything that they're doing in Gaza. We want them to know we're with them. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=56.4s)]
*  We support them and we're praying for them this weekend. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=65.6s)]
*  Just as basic background, why is it that Christians stand so strongly with Israel? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=70.12s)]
*  Well, there are many reasons to stand with Israel and support Israel that actually have nothing to do with faith. I think all Americans should. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=76.92s)]
*  But as Christians, we share the same Bible with the Jewish people. Most of our Bible is the Hebrew Bible. We share a common faith and a common God and that God made promises to the people of Israel that we believe will all be fulfilled one day. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  So until then, we understand the really it's a spiritual battle against them and we want to pray for them. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=99.8s)]
*  We want to bless them and we want to just help them. And there's no greater power in the world than prayer. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=108.2s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. But right now, Israel is in the middle of a battle, a shooting war against Hamas, trying to take out that entire terror organization. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=115.92s)]
*  When you pray this upcoming weekend, what are you praying for? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=126.56s)]
*  Well, we're praying for the leaders of Israel to have wisdom from above that they make the right decisions. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=130.0s)]
*  We're praying for the encouragement and support of those that are on the front lines in this battle. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=136.28s)]
*  We're praying for the hostages that they would be released. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=142.88s)]
*  It's going to take a miracle, but we pray that they'll be released and unharmed. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=146.16s)]
*  We're praying for all the innocent civilians, no matter on which side, that their lives would be protected. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=151.32s)]
*  And, you know, we're even praying for our enemy that they would be given a chance to repent for their evil ways. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  And so we're praying for everyone, praying for blessing and that the God who can turn all things for good do that even in this horrible situation. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=166.04s)]
*  No doubt all things are possible through him. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  Things we mere mortals think are impossible, certainly not for God. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  Dr. Susan Michael, thank you so much for your message. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=183.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=187.12s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=188.28s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMufpRycQA&t=189.2s)]
