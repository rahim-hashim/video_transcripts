# Peter Doocy: Leaks are coming out of the Harris campaign
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc)
*  Senior White House correspondent, Peter Doocy joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey, watch it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=4.0s)]
*  Good morning, and we're seeing now what happens when a candidate, in this case, Kamala Harris, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=5.44s)]
*  is not surrounded by a team of longtime loyalists, and that is leaks start to come out. This is [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  something we almost never saw from candidate Biden or President Biden, but now there's an Axios item [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=17.92s)]
*  with the title, Inside Detention in the Harris-Frankenstein Team. And the problem appears to be that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=22.96s)]
*  Obama-era operatives have been jammed into an office in Wilmington full of Biden people, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=30.0s)]
*  and nobody knows who is really doing what. The story says, quote, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=35.440000000000005s)]
*  the entanglement of these different entities has led to many people feeling a real lack [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=39.6s)]
*  of role clarity, and the source is one person involved in the campaign. One of the first Harris [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=45.28s)]
*  hires was Eric Holder, the Obama-era attorney general who wound up vetting running mates, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=51.36s)]
*  and his good buddy Mark Elias, the lawyer who got squeezed out of Wilmington by the Biden team [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=56.16s)]
*  last year, is back to help the team get ready for legal challenges in November. But until January, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=61.12s)]
*  Joe Biden is still the president, and we just heard a few minutes ago he's got some big trips [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=67.84s)]
*  still coming up, including Peru and Brazil. It is likely that both President Biden and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=73.44s)]
*  President Xi will be at APEC and the G20 later this year. I don't have any announcements to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=80.72s)]
*  make on either President Biden's travel or a potential meeting, but the likelihood is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=86.0s)]
*  they'll both be there, and if they are, it would only be natural for them to have the chance to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=91.28s)]
*  sit down with one another. We saw President Biden on the beach in Delaware for hours yesterday. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=95.44s)]
*  There is very, very little going on here, and a very well-placed source who works inside [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=102.0s)]
*  told me that the general feeling among staff right now is one of senioritis. Senioritis, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=109.12s)]
*  so Peter, this story from Axios about the Frankenstein team, because part of it is the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=115.76s)]
*  Harris people, part of it is the Wilmington Joe campaign, part of it is the White House people, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=121.28s)]
*  and then you've got the Obama people coming in. They don't know who's in charge, but just the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=125.92s)]
*  fact that apparently Axios spoke to six people on the inside, this is new, because this means [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=130.24s)]
*  they are leaking, which the Biden team never did. No, and President Biden was surrounded by people [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=136.4s)]
*  who have been with him for decades and decades. Vice President Harris doesn't have that except for [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=142.64s)]
*  her husband and her sister and her brother-in-law, as far as we know. She doesn't have a small, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=148.64s)]
*  tight-knit circle of political advisors who have been with her the whole time, from [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  her rise in California to Washington to now the executive office building. It was very frustrating [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  in 2019 and 2020 trying to get anything out of these Biden people, because he treats a lot of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  his close staff like they are family. He had two staffers living with him during COVID. It was just [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=172.16s)]
*  him and Jill and two staffers, and so you're never going to get anything out of those people. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=179.2s)]
*  And if you go back and look, no leaks like this about the Biden campaign until the bitter end. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=184.0s)]
*  Only a laptop, but it's not real. So too bad. Hey, Peter, real quick. So Joe was on the beach for [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=190.16s)]
*  hours. How many times did he apply sunscreen? Do we know? You got a poll report, right? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=196.32s)]
*  I don't know about the sunscreen, but we'll figure out if he's using the spray or if he's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=203.12s)]
*  just putting it directly on, and we'll have that for you later. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh2G4Q-Zwc&t=207.2s)]
