# US forces ordered to be 'ready to deploy' as Iran vows revenge
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20)
*  Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Austin ordering U.S. forces to be ready to deploy as Iran [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=0.0s)]
*  vows revenge for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=4.96s)]
*  And now Axios reports, Vice President Harrison intends to stick to the Biden foreign policy [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=8.72s)]
*  game plan. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=13.36s)]
*  That's scary. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=14.36s)]
*  Let's bring in John Elliott, a former Trump National Security Aid and Marine veteran. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=15.36s)]
*  John, your reaction to the administration still pushing ceasefire rather than looking [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=19.72s)]
*  at an opportunity to wipe out or to totally disable the world's premier terror organization? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=25.56s)]
*  Well, absolutely, Brian. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=33.08s)]
*  What's happening here in southern Lebanon with Hezbollah on its back foot, not only [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=34.96s)]
*  did you see with Nasrallah being taken out here and he's somebody, look, anybody who's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=40.4s)]
*  a Marine veteran the way I am and the way any other American looks at this, you think [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=45.12s)]
*  back to 41 years ago in 1983 in October when you had 241 servicemen, mainly Marines, that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=49.52s)]
*  were killed by Nasrallah, by his henchmen there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=58.24s)]
*  And when you look back, all the intelligence that the Israelis are getting right now from [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=61.92s)]
*  southern Lebanon is because the Lebanese are just tired of Hezbollah. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=65.76s)]
*  There's been 45 years that they used to have a great, they used to have a Monaco on the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  eastern Mediterranean there with Beirut. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  It was a beautiful place. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=77.12s)]
*  They had a lot of tourism there. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  Last 45 years, there's just been nothing but this meat grinder where Hezbollah has been [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  trying to take the attack and has been taking the attack to the Israelis. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  And that's why right now, fundamentally, the intelligence that's coming in that destroys, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=88.48s)]
*  whether it's Nasrallah or all these guys with the walkie-talkers and the pagers, they're [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=93.2s)]
*  the ones that it's really tough intel that's been given to them because ordinary Lebanese [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=97.4s)]
*  are just tired of the BS and they're just not putting up with it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  And they're celebrating in Syria because Hezbollah went in there and were burying [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=106.4s)]
*  people alive, treating them like total barbarians. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=108.8s)]
*  But that was a learning moment for the IDF. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=111.96s)]
*  They got a chance to see the hierarchy, Hezbollah in action. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=114.44s)]
*  When the bios came up after Hezbollah fighters lost their lives, they got a sense of who [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=117.56s)]
*  answers to whom and they also got incredible intelligence. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=123.0s)]
*  You also told me they have 30 leaders dead, but about 3,000 wounded with this play, exploding [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=126.16s)]
*  pagers and walkie-talkies. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=132.2s)]
*  There's a window here for the IDF. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=134.67999999999998s)]
*  Would you take it? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely, we'd take it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  If you were the Israelis, you would take it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=139.76s)]
*  And if you look back to what President Trump did back when we were supporting him on the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=141.27999999999997s)]
*  National Security Council in the White House, President Trump did not hesitate. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=144.6s)]
*  He was given a window. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=148.44s)]
*  He was told by intelligence that the number one Iranian Revolutionary Guard leader, Soleimani, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  was available and was flying into the Baghdad airport and he had a short window and he had [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=156.76s)]
*  green light, make it happen. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=164.0s)]
*  They took out Soleimani and that's something where rather than us calling for, rather than [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  Biden and Harris calling for a ceasefire, it was somebody who was on his front foot, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  President Trump, to make it happen. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=174.72s)]
*  And that's why Iran feared us. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=176.44s)]
*  That's why Iran would never be taking any steps. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=178.11999999999998s)]
*  And that's why Israelis now looking to finish the job up in southern Lebanon because there [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  is support actually by the Lebanese people who are tired of Hezbollah running their country. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=185.72s)]
*  And we're just bystanders sitting on the side, having to act if Iran gets involved. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=190.72s)]
*  But right now they are cowering, the Ayatollah hiding in a bunker. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=195.16s)]
*  John, thanks. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=197.96s)]
*  Yeah, John, thanks so much. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=198.96s)]
*  Thanks, Brian. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=201.36s)]
*  A perilous time. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6iIe6T_k20&t=202.36s)]
