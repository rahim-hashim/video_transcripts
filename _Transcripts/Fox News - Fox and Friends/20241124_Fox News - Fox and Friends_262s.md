# Death penalty 'should have been on the table' in Laken Riley case: Ted Williams
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0)
*  Your honor, I'm asking you to please give Jose Abara the same thing he gave us [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=0.0s)]
*  when he made the choice to take Lakin's life and destroy ours. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=5.4s)]
*  He showed no mercy on Lakin when she was begging for her life. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=10.36s)]
*  Lakin Riley's mother pleading for the maximum penalty as an illegal immigrant [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=14.84s)]
*  is sentenced to life in prison for killing the Georgia nursing student. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=19.44s)]
*  But the death penalty was off the table thanks to the Soros backed prosecutor [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=23.52s)]
*  initially in charge of the case. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=28.64s)]
*  Here to discuss is former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  Ted Williams. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=36.36s)]
*  Ted, I know this is something you're not happy about. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=38.36s)]
*  Talk to us about what this does to the family. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=41.32s)]
*  I mean, clearly we see her mom pleading for this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  She saw, as we all did, the 18 minutes that her daughter [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=47.56s)]
*  fought for her life. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  We also saw footage yesterday, Ted, of her collapsing on the side of the road [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  when she found out the news that the body that they found was her daughter's. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=58.16s)]
*  What do you make of all this? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=64.4s)]
*  You know, guys, I can tell you no family should have to go through [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=67.16s)]
*  what the Riley family has had to go through when it comes to their [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=73.12s)]
*  22 year old daughter who had everything to live for. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=78.36s)]
*  This was just a 22 year old nursing student [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=84.91999999999999s)]
*  that just decided in February of 2024 to go for a jog. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=89.44s)]
*  And here along this trail, she was confronted [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=96.0s)]
*  by this illegal immigrant, Jose Obara. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=100.44s)]
*  And we know that it was Jose Obara who confronted, stalked her [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  and took a rock and bashed her skull in. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=111.2s)]
*  We know that by virtue of the physical evidence, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  as well as the scientific evidence that was found there on that scene. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=119.72000000000001s)]
*  And if there was ever, ever a case that called for the death penalty, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  it was this case. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  This was a brutal, violent killing of this young lady. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=133.52s)]
*  And the death penalty, as far as I'm concerned, as a lawyer, I can tell you, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=139.28s)]
*  I believe that the death penalty should have been on the table. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=144.2s)]
*  You know, politicians all up and down the board have blood on their hands [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=148.64s)]
*  for this case everywhere from, you know, allowing him into the country [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=153.48s)]
*  in the first place, allowing him to safe refuge in New York, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=158.6s)]
*  releasing him twice and then obviously down there [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=163.76s)]
*  in Georgia. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=168.44s)]
*  What was the the with this prosecutor, though, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=170.04s)]
*  did she have a stated reason why she didn't want to go for the death penalty? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=173.28s)]
*  The prosecutor who has now not been reelected, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=179.72s)]
*  Deborah Gonzalez, or had stated of approximately four years ago [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=186.32s)]
*  that she did not believe in the death penalty. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  She believed that she was, quote unquote, a progressive prosecutor. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=195.28s)]
*  But I think what I have to believe is that when prosecutors get in the office, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=200.28s)]
*  they evolve. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  They look at the facts and the circumstances of each individual case, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=207.08s)]
*  and they make the decision as to whether or what the punishment should be. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=211.56s)]
*  When you look at Jose O'Bara here, who had, as you've said, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  been arrested in several different jurisdictions and nobody put a hole on him. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=221.12s)]
*  This is certainly an individual who I believe had no social redeeming qualities [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=227.32000000000002s)]
*  and that the death penalty itself should have been on the table. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=233.96s)]
*  Well, perhaps it's heartening that DAs who bring politics into these processes [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=238.56s)]
*  and find themselves out of a job more and more often now. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=243.72s)]
*  Ted, we got to leave it there. Thank you for being with us today. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=247.44s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABFr95j0&t=251.20000000000002s)]
