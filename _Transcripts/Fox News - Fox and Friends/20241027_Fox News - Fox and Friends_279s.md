# NY'S TOP DOG: Trump's fur-vent spirit draws unlikely comparison
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg)
*  Every evening and sometimes every morning, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=0.0s)]
*  we go for a walk and that's what the dog does, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=2.34s)]
*  chase squirrels. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=5.5s)]
*  I mean, it's cliche, everybody's dog does it, right? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=6.34s)]
*  On a leash? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=8.18s)]
*  Chases it, but doesn't. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=9.02s)]
*  I don't walk my dog on a leash. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=9.84s)]
*  You don't, okay. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=11.02s)]
*  I got that, I got. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=12.22s)]
*  You got that figured out? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=13.06s)]
*  I'm pretty proud, I walked in there [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=13.88s)]
*  and everybody was like, oh, oh, oh. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=14.98s)]
*  I'm like heel, and she's, it's good. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=16.18s)]
*  And then I say loose, and she's off. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=18.86s)]
*  And then I say squirrel, pew. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=20.82s)]
*  Does he, does she eat the squirrel? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=22.62s)]
*  This is a great life lesson. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=25.98s)]
*  Um, she's super fast, super fast. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=27.66s)]
*  She's a Doberman. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=31.14s)]
*  They got some wheels, but they don't have [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=32.2s)]
*  the same kind of speed of a squirrel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=34.3s)]
*  So she's got one in her life. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=36.66s)]
*  But she's chased, I would put the over under at a thousand. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=39.06s)]
*  Yeah, I gotcha. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=42.46s)]
*  And that kind of resilience and coming back [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=43.3s)]
*  and no quit is what I've tried to teach my kids, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=45.14s)]
*  often to no avail. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=47.94s)]
*  But my dog has listened and she will not quit. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=50.3s)]
*  She'll keep going, one for 1,000, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=53.28s)]
*  and still signs up for it the next evening. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=55.58s)]
*  Do you know who else never quit? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  That correlates with the size of her brain. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=59.72s)]
*  The person who also never quits is Donald Trump. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  And he's back. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=65.48s)]
*  He's back in New York City. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=66.32s)]
*  Take it away, Will. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=68.44s)]
*  He is, that means we need to use this song [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=69.6s)]
*  as our next bump in. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=71.84s)]
*  He's back in the New York groove. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=73.32s)]
*  Cause he's gonna head to Madison Square Garden tonight. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=75.44s)]
*  A star studded lineup is set to take the stage [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=77.72s)]
*  alongside Trump at the world's most famous arena. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=80.0s)]
*  And that's where Alexis McAdams is this morning. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=84.36s)]
*  Alexis, good morning. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=86.97999999999999s)]
*  Hey, good morning. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=89.86s)]
*  Yeah, who would have thought, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=90.69999999999999s)]
*  I don't think I would have a few years ago, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=91.52s)]
*  that the former president would be the headlining act [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=93.13999999999999s)]
*  at Madison Square Garden. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=95.3s)]
*  You can check it out here behind me and see, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=96.46s)]
*  this is what we're seeing outside in the Jumbotron. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=98.86s)]
*  It says, dream big again. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  President Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=103.69999999999999s)]
*  And I'm just gonna pause for a second [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=106.44s)]
*  so you can hear what's going on. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=107.78s)]
*  USA, USA. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=108.86s)]
*  So a lot of USA chants, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=111.02s)]
*  which we hear at a lot of rallies too. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=112.33999999999999s)]
*  I was just in Pennsylvania last night at Penn State. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=113.97999999999999s)]
*  We heard a lot of that there as well. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=117.76s)]
*  I'm gonna step out of the way [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=118.6s)]
*  so you can start to see what's going on. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=119.42s)]
*  So people are from all over the place. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=120.4s)]
*  They've been out here for several hours and counting here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=122.52s)]
*  The former president's not gonna be here on stage [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=125.2s)]
*  until about five o'clock, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=127.28s)]
*  but Elon Musk will be here before that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=128.72s)]
*  and some other big names. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=130.56s)]
*  So people are very hyped up [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=131.46s)]
*  to watch this happen in real time. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  I want you to take a look at this, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  because this is one of the main topics [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=136.24s)]
*  that the former president is gonna talk about, okay? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=137.8s)]
*  He's gonna highlight the 215,000 migrants [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=139.8s)]
*  that have flooded the city here in New York since 2022 [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  and the increases in crime that have come with it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=146.98000000000002s)]
*  Since 2022, the New York City mayor's office [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=149.78s)]
*  says they've spent more than $5 billion [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  to care for migrants. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=155.06s)]
*  So that's a lot of cash. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=156.58s)]
*  And people here in New York City, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=157.9s)]
*  when we talk to them on the campaign trail [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=160.10000000000002s)]
*  across the country and in deep blue New York, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=161.8s)]
*  they're fed up with that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=163.70000000000002s)]
*  They don't think that's where the money should be going. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=164.54000000000002s)]
*  New York City has been dealing with that surge [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=166.70000000000002s)]
*  in migrant crime, including robberies, assaults, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=168.3s)]
*  two NYPD officers, as you guys know, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=171.08s)]
*  were beaten by an angry mob [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=172.96s)]
*  while trying to break up a disorderly group of migrants [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=174.36s)]
*  in the heart of Times Square. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=177.04s)]
*  You can see all of those issues in those video clips here. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=178.2s)]
*  Trump appears to have gained some ground though [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=181.38s)]
*  among New York City voters recently. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=183.6s)]
*  A New York Times poll shows Trump's gaining four points [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=186.0s)]
*  over his 2020 performance against President Biden. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=188.56s)]
*  That's the same poll that shows Vice President Harris [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  doing 10 points worse than Biden did in 2020. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=194.24s)]
*  I wanna take another live look here [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=197.16s)]
*  as you can see exactly what's happening. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=198.44s)]
*  They're actually letting more people in [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  so the crowd does continue to grow. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=201.46s)]
*  We're used to seeing this though. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=203.34s)]
*  I know, Will, you were out there, or Pete rather too, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=204.38s)]
*  in Butler and you saw how big those crowds were. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=206.74s)]
*  I don't know exactly how many people [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  are gonna be lined up out here [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=210.78s)]
*  because it's kind of like a first come first serve basis. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=211.86s)]
*  You have to register for the tickets. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=213.78s)]
*  They're expecting about 19,000 people at least inside of MSG [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=215.22s)]
*  for Trump's big back to New York rally. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  All right, thank you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=222.22s)]
*  Wonder what MSG holds. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=223.62s)]
*  I know they sold it out. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  But you always gotta put a stage in there too [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=227.46s)]
*  so that takes out some of the seats. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=228.94s)]
*  Yeah, and then behind the stage. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=230.4s)]
*  Like at concerts, you don't go behind. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=231.44s)]
*  So I'd be curious. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=233.12s)]
*  I'm gonna be curious to know how many people [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=234.56s)]
*  are from New York versus people coming in from out of town. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=236.54s)]
*  You saw that number that she had up [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=239.48s)]
*  of five and a half billion dollars [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  being spent on illegals. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=244.32s)]
*  When I was out looking at things on the streets, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=245.6s)]
*  reporting this week, the National Guard [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=249.0s)]
*  is processing illegals at the main intake center. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=252.96s)]
*  So that's not, that amount of money [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=255.72s)]
*  is not being included in that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=258.09999999999997s)]
*  Do you know what I'm saying? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=260.06s)]
*  Sure, sure. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJtGa_JexPg&t=260.9s)]
