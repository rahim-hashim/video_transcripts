# They know Kamala Harris can't do this by herself: Sarah Sanders
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8)
*  40 days of no interviews. Kamala Harris and her vice presidential pick, Tim Walsh, will [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=0.0s)]
*  finally sit down in front of a camera tomorrow. But is this some of what we can expect from [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=5.44s)]
*  the president, from the vice president? This whole thing about the border, we've been [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=10.08s)]
*  to the border. We've been to the border. You haven't been to the border. And I haven't [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=14.6s)]
*  been to Europe. What else are you going to do to fix this problem with inflation? Thank [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=19.6s)]
*  you. Well, let's start with this. Prices have gone up. So joining us now is Arkansas Governor [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=24.92s)]
*  Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Good morning to you, Governor. Good morning. Thanks for having [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=35.36s)]
*  me. Well, thanks for coming on. Why do you think they have to do this together? I mean, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=40.56s)]
*  I understand it's vice president. She's running for president with Tim Walsh. But do you think [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=44.36s)]
*  there is a motivation? Why would they put them together for this first interview? Of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=48.84s)]
*  course, there's motivation. They know that Kamala Harris can't get through an interview [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=54.12s)]
*  all by herself. There is not a lot of confidence in somebody to become the leader of the free [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=58.0s)]
*  world and ask people to make her president of the United States when she can't even sit [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=64.0s)]
*  down with an interview. This isn't even a tough interview. This is on CNN. This is one [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=68.64s)]
*  of their media allies. She should take this opportunity to show the American people that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=73.06s)]
*  she can handle hard questions. It's clear that her own team and her own party think [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=78.16s)]
*  she needs a babysitter. And that's why they're putting her vice presidential nominee on the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  stage with her so that he can step in and answer questions if things go like the clips [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=87.48s)]
*  we just saw, like she has done in previous interviews. Some former Democrats are teaming [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=92.92s)]
*  up with Donald Trump. You had Tulsi Gabbard just yesterday, the day before, I think, and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=97.68s)]
*  then R.F.K. Jr. over the weekend. They're joining his transition team. So why do you [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=101.56s)]
*  think the GOP is appealing to independent voters and to some Democrats? Well, I think [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=105.84s)]
*  there's a lot of reasons. I think one, it's because this matchup could not be more stark [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=112.2s)]
*  between the two candidates. Donald Trump has a record of success of leading on things like [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=116.88s)]
*  building a strong American economy, securing our border, helping us have a strong presence [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=121.56s)]
*  on the world stage, while on the other hand, Kamala Harris has been part of an administration [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=128.12s)]
*  of total failure. Look at everything that has happened in the last four years. She has [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=132.72s)]
*  to own that. She cannot run away from it. And even prominent Democrats don't have confidence [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=138.28s)]
*  in her ability to lead this country. She was the laughing stock of the Biden administration [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=143.96s)]
*  just a few months ago, and now the hypocrisy is so unbelievable. They want us to believe [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=149.0s)]
*  that they truly think that she can take this job on. I think that the fact that they're [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=155.12s)]
*  not letting her do an interview by herself tells us everything that we need to know. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  She is not prepared to lead the country. Donald Trump is because he's shown he can do it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=164.32s)]
*  Even prominent voices in the Democrat Party see that, and they're joining the ticket and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=169.44s)]
*  starting to campaign for him around the country. And I think it's a great thing that he's building [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=173.96s)]
*  this huge coalition that will help push him over the top in November. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=178.36s)]
*  You know, Governor, you have implemented something in your great state of Arkansas. The school [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=181.52s)]
*  year's kicking off, so you're offering these statewide grants to keep kids off of their [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=185.96s)]
*  phones when they're in school. It includes no smartphones before high school, phone-free [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=190.4s)]
*  schools, no social media before age 16, and more outdoor play. And you're doing this because, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=194.88s)]
*  according to Gallup, the kids are spending almost five hours, a teenager, on social media [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=200.68s)]
*  per day. So this is incredible. I know you're getting support from Democrats and Republicans. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=207.44s)]
*  Why did you do this, and what is the response from parents? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=213.16s)]
*  You know, this is something that I think we have to take a much stronger look at. We are [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  watching a true mental health crisis take place, not just in our country but around [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=222.48s)]
*  the world among young people. We're seeing anxiety, suicide, depression rates skyrocket. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=227.28s)]
*  And one of the biggest factors contributing to that is the use of smartphones and social [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=233.04s)]
*  media. Jonathan Hayat wrote a book called The Anxious Generation. I sent that to every [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=237.64s)]
*  single governor across the country and every member of our legislature, because this is [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=243.12s)]
*  an issue that we really can come together and do something about. We started a program [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=247.76s)]
*  within the first couple of months. Seventy-five percent of school districts in our state voluntarily [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=253.44s)]
*  opted in to go phone-free and participate in this grant program. Well, we're hopeful [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=258.8s)]
*  that more and more will continue to do that, but this is just in the first about two months [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  of the program being available, and we hope to get to 100 percent. But that is without [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=269.42s)]
*  forcing or making them take this step, but voluntarily 75 percent of school districts [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=275.44s)]
*  are opting in. Parents, teachers, administrators, they're hungry for some type of leadership [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=283.56s)]
*  on this, and we're glad that we're making a difference for our students, because it [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=289.23999999999995s)]
*  is becoming a true problem. Governor, it's awesome. If you talk to Donald Trump about [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=293.4s)]
*  this, I think this is something that would get a lot of support. I certainly think this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=297.08s)]
*  would be a great issue for him to lead on. We're seeing other countries take this step, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=301.88s)]
*  and I think this is something that the United States really needs to take a more aggressive [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=306.36s)]
*  approach. Work with our parents, work with our schools, because we've seen the negative [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=311.44s)]
*  effects. We're not saying that there aren't some useful tools that can be found in smartphones [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  and social media, but our kids are simply not prepared to take that on, and we can do [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=321.08s)]
*  a much better job, not just as a governor, but as a mom. This is something I want to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=325.08s)]
*  see us lead on. Governor, thank you so much for coming on with us. Absolutely. Thanks [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=329.28s)]
*  for having me. You're welcome. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwmcueBXT8&t=334.96s)]
