# Trump rips Biden for sabotaging transition: 'Making it really difficult'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg)
*  Well, Donald Trump said yesterday that Joe Biden is doing everything possible to try to make this transition difficult first listen to this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=0.0s)]
*  And we'll talk about it [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=7.3s)]
*  You know they talk about a transition they're always saying oh no we want to have a smooth [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=9.88s)]
*  Transition from party to party for you know of government. Well, they're making it really difficult [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=14.56s)]
*  They're throwing everything they can in the way they're giving out [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=19.46s)]
*  Trillions of dollars in nonsense in Green New Deal crap that isn't worth a damn thing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=24.48s)]
*  In fact, it's a negative for the country another positive what they're trying to do is get all that money out the door [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=30.44s)]
*  There are a lot of things that they're doing to try to make it more difficult and to sabotage Donald Trump's campaign or his [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=35.300000000000004s)]
*  Or his presidency when he gets an office in two weeks [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  Not only are they trying to ban that offshore drilling last week [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=44.6s)]
*  They tried to limit energy development in Nevada for the next 20 years [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=47.72s)]
*  They tried to auction off the border wall at pennies on a dollar [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=51.6s)]
*  Thankfully your governor down there in the great state of Texas Lawrence stopped it and they the court system actually blocked it which was wonderful [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=55.08s)]
*  He allowed don't forget during the last four years millions of illegals to cross our border on day one [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=63.0s)]
*  He cut off the pipelines. He opened up the border [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=68.84s)]
*  So now he is panicked because Donald Trump's gonna come in and make America great again lower our costs lower [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=72.38s)]
*  Inflation and he he wants his agenda to be pushed through now [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=79.68s)]
*  He's making it very difficult Donald Trump does have a difficult task because if he does try to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=83.78s)]
*  Have an executive order that says no you will be able to drill this happened in 2019 when he did this with Barack Obama [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=89.44s)]
*  And then he signed the executive order it went to court. It was challenged in court [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=95.28s)]
*  So it was tied up in court for a while [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  so the best thing we can hope for is that Congress will [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=100.44s)]
*  Eradicate all this or just change the laws change the the no drilling laws and do that immediately [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=103.24s)]
*  we have a very slim majority and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=109.36s)]
*  Donald Trump is gonna have to rely on all those Republicans to get his agenda across not their own but his well keep in mind [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=112.72s)]
*  We have heard Donald Trump say from the get-go on day one. It's gonna be drill baby drill [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  So the Democrats and this administration is trying to put as many roadblocks in the way as possible [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  And so what are they doing they're waiting until the last minute the 11th hour to do all this stuff and easily as you pointed [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=129.24s)]
*  Out when Donald Trump tried to undo some of the Barack Obama drilling things the court said no you can't do it found it [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=134.84s)]
*  unconstitutional and said the only way to fix it is Congress the problem with Congress is because Mike Johnson has got such a [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=142.76s)]
*  Slim majority and you need 60 in the Senate [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=148.84s)]
*  They're gonna have to put this on one of the reconciliation bills [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=152.12s)]
*  And as we heard from the president a couple days ago, he would like one big beautiful bill [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=155.76s)]
*  But now the fight in cap on Capitol Hill because he's gonna go Trump's gonna visit with Senate Republicans tomorrow night [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=160.64s)]
*  Senate Republicans are gonna try to talk him into two bills because one bill is dangerous [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=167.32s)]
*  And if it's just one bill, it's gonna have to wait till May where is if it's two bills they can do border and energy [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  Just pretty much right out of the game [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=180.32s)]
*  Know there's a lot of talk about the divide within the Republican Party and there is some divide when it comes to this [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=181.84s)]
*  You know, it's a slim majority [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=187.08s)]
*  But there has to be a conversation about the Democrats not learning anything from the election [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=188.8s)]
*  Right Donald Trump ran on drill baby drill the voters said that they wanted him there [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=194.56s)]
*  they supported the agenda of that and so for the Democrats to not moderate on any of that and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=200.08s)]
*  Essentially back Joe Biden and said hurrah hurrah block Donald Trump in every move when it comes to this [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=207.24s)]
*  It just seems like this is gonna be a resistance campaign yet again from the Democrats that they're not gonna try to work on [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=213.56s)]
*  Ways that they can agree why try to further this this notion when the voters even in your party you lost them [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=221.24s)]
*  So work with him on it. Try to get some type of compromise when it comes to I don't know what they want clean cleaner [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=228.32s)]
*  Drilling and all there's ways to work on that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=235.82s)]
*  Making all energy clean but to suggest that we shouldn't be drilling and to limit the president try to block him on that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=238.7s)]
*  It's just it's not smart six hundred and twenty five million acres [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=245.58s)]
*  They're trying to ban this up offshore drilling, which is 14% of our oil and gas production [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=248.86s)]
*  He's also gonna be in California today is the president creating a he's going to set aside [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=253.9s)]
*  Creating a national monument in the south of Joshua tree banning drilling mining and other industrial activities [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=258.94s)]
*  By the way, when you ban mining you're stopping the construction of batteries [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=265.86s)]
*  So you have you have rare earth needed for this batteries for to get us off oil and gas [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=269.54s)]
*  You can't at the same time tell people in Minnesota. You can't strip mine and you can't mine in, Nevada [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=275.54s)]
*  That's where all our gas or all our rare earth is or we could get it from the Congo. Oh, sorry [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=280.9s)]
*  Through the Belt and Road program the Congo now belongs to China. So it's you you keep on [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=287.78s)]
*  cutting off your own knees [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=293.98s)]
*  Every time you start to talk about green energy. So I think the president's gonna try to repurpose a lot of the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=295.86s)]
*  Inflation reduction act if Joe Biden really wanted this why didn't he do it four years ago? He's doing this to sabotage [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=301.82s)]
*  Donald Trump this green nonsense is just out of guys over the break [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=308.46s)]
*  I rented a car and I thought that it was you know, I drive a truck, but I wanted to speed car [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=313.66s)]
*  so I get this car and [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=319.46s)]
*  Didn't know it looks like a regular car doesn't say it on there. They don't tell me at the rental ends up being a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=322.22s)]

*  Doesn't have the right [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fMYeA_8HPg&t=341.70000000000005s)]
