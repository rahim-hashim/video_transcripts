# Trump reveals future plans as 2028 hats go on sale
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI)
*  Alright, so the president spoke like spoke sat down Christian Welker meet the press and then flying back on the plane [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=0.0s)]
*  He talked to the press like he always does moving the story forward [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  The other thing he was asked when he gave meet the press there's his third interview since he won which is unbelievable [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  But she is fair like she'll ask a question. You know, what is the future? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=16.18s)]
*  She's not movement. Can it continue without you? These are interesting questions that everything is ABC [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=20.22s)]
*  Everything's gonna be a gotcha quest you're doing a terrible job. Tell us why I think she's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=25.76s)]
*  Not hostile toward her tone is is that but one of the questions she asked not to get off topic is [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=30.28s)]
*  Would he consider a third term and he finally put the issue to bed, I guess watch [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=37.28s)]
*  The Trump Organization is selling hats that say Trump 2028. Yeah, are you seriously considering a third term? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=42.84s)]
*  Mr. President, even though it's prohibited by the Constitution or is this about staying politically viable. I will say this [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=51.72s)]
*  So many people want me to do it [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=58.68s)]
*  I have never had requests so strong as that but it's something that to the best of my knowledge [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=60.66s)]
*  You're not allowed to do I don't know if that's constitutional, but this is not something I'm looking to do [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=66.8s)]
*  I'm looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=72.42s)]
*  Ideally a great Republican when you look to the future. Mr. President [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  Do you think the MAGA movement can survive without you as its leader? Yes, I do [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  What gives you I think it's so strong and I think we have tremendous people [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=87.68s)]
*  I think we have a tremendous group of people we talked about a number of them [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=91.12s)]
*  You look at Marco you look at JD Vance who's fantastic you look at I could name [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  1015 20 people right now just sitting here [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  So a couple of things he he mentioned Marco. He mentioned vice president Vance and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=105.04s)]
*  And people think that's a big deal. They doesn't just say JD Vance is my but why would he nobody does Eisenhower? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=111.04s)]
*  Didn't pick Nixon, you know [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=116.96s)]
*  Reagan didn't say George W HW Bush has to be the next president [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  He lets it play up just to respect the process and let people learn it through the primary plus [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=122.32s)]
*  I mean if you think about everybody is on board outside Nikki Haley [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=126.96s)]
*  Almost everybody that would want to be president is on board working for him in some capacity [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=131.68s)]
*  whether it's in the Senate the house or [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=136.04s)]
*  Or actually his cabinet and he did remind he reminded Kristen. He said I'm only three months in you know [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't know. He was talking about other policies, but that that makes sense. He's only three months in when it comes to JD Vance [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=144.6s)]
*  We don't know yet. Yeah, he seems like a strong candidate [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=150.04s)]
*  He seems like he might run for the position [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=152.76s)]
*  But we're we're what three and a half years away from an election [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=155.12s)]
*  I guess the two things that struck me was first that he didn't flinch when she said [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=159.12s)]
*  Will the MAGA movement continue without of course it well, you know, he said it without a doubt [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=164.44s)]
*  He didn't give any ambiguity that is gonna continue it up and I think the second thing is he not only did he say [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He said I can name ten other people as well, which is really true [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=176.8s)]
*  The Republicans have this large bench of people the Democrats are searching for some type of leader right now [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=182.68s)]
*  Who's who's moderate who still has the base of the party? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=189.28s)]
*  There is a wide and the thing I like about it Marco [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=194.0s)]
*  Rubio the secretary of state and their friends they're working together and all these people like each other [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=197.94s)]
*  And I don't think the president is gonna get involved in the primary. He also talked about due process [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=203.74s)]
*  He said she asked about these illegals and he said if we give them all due process, they're here illegally [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=209.14s)]
*  They they came into our country [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=214.46s)]
*  Do they really deserve the rights that that people who did it the right way or citizens have and he said the problem is it's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=216.1s)]
*  All gonna get backed up in the courts [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=222.74s)]
*  We're gonna have millions and millions of people that have to go through the due process [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=224.26000000000002s)]
*  He said I was elected to get them quote the hell out of here. He said [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=227.26000000000002s)]
*  He also talked about the ballroom at the White House [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=231.54000000000002s)]
*  He's gonna build a ballroom at the White House and pay for it himself on the other side of the Oval Office [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=233.62s)]
*  Yeah, and he said he's gonna raise the funds. So don't worry [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=237.3s)]
*  I'm not taking that from taxpayers and then the Democrats always say he's gonna get rid of your Medicaid [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=239.74s)]
*  He's gonna get rid of your Medicare gonna get rid of your Social Security [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=243.98000000000002s)]
*  he said I am NOT cutting those right a couple of things on Medicaid some that's where the rubber hits the road because [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=246.34s)]
*  Barack Obama Joe Biden expanded the people who are eligible for Medicaid by so many [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=252.74s)]
*  That it's unaffordable and sustainable. It's not like the number one expenditure that the federal government's got to pay [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=258.34s)]
*  It's supposed to be state aid pay the states. So that's where the big battle is gonna be just a quick thing on the MAGA movement [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=264.0s)]
*  It's very similar to Andrew Jackson [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=269.38s)]
*  Andrew Jackson became more part powerful after he left office because James K [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=270.78s)]
*  Paul Martin Van Buren Sam Houston in Texas [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=275.18s)]
*  He had like four or five guys who went on to become president they kept leaning back on Jackson every time something [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=278.2s)]
*  Needs to be passed through Congress. They would go back to Jackson out of power [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=282.92s)]
*  I could absolutely see Trump at Mar-a-Lago or in Bedminster [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=286.62s)]
*  Trying to break log jams in 2029 or 2032 or whatever it was because they don't know I'm sorry [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=291.56s)]
*  He's shown no signs of that. He wants to slow down, right? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=297.8s)]
*  What Brian saying is Jackson was the mag [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=302.52s)]
*  Make America great and then Donald Trump comes along and says again [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  Mag and MAGA [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  Maga will last for a long time. I believe I do too. It's a movement. I'm Steve juicy [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYR_BNpkKBI&t=312.28000000000003s)]
