# If Kamala’s polls were better, would she still be blasting Trump?: Kevin McCarthy
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E)
*  We all must speak out against any form of political violence, and I'm very clear about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=0.0s)]
*  that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=9.0s)]
*  Some of the people closest to Donald Trump when he was president, generals, including [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=10.0s)]
*  most recently John Kelly, a four-star Marine general, have been very clear about the danger [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=14.36s)]
*  and the threat that Donald Trump poses to America and the fact that he is unfit to serve. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=21.5s)]
*  No matter what, they're talking threat. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=28.68s)]
*  Top Republican lawmakers now calling on Vice President Kamala Harris to stop the dangerous [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=31.2s)]
*  anti-Trump rhetoric, fearing it could ramp up more threats against the former president [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=36.0s)]
*  who's already had two assassination attempts. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=41.88s)]
*  Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy joins us now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Kevin, does this surprise you at all considering, you know, Biden ran this fear-mongering campaign, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=48.64s)]
*  then Kamala said it was going to be all about joy? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, the joy's gone. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=56.8s)]
*  Now she's back to Joe's approach. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  It seems like the only thing they've got. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  It's something they do always to President Trump and always say, look, it's desperate. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  It's very dangerous. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=68.12s)]
*  And it is deliberate of what they're doing, because it's not just Kamala Harris doing [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=69.12s)]
*  it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=74.4s)]
*  Now Hillary Clinton. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=75.4s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=76.4s)]
*  It's going through all of their spokespeople. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=77.4s)]
*  But think, this is different than any other election. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=79.97999999999999s)]
*  There have been two assassination attempts. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=82.12s)]
*  This is a moment in time that they should pull back and realize how dangerous the language [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=86.14s)]
*  that they are using right now and who are they speaking to and what direction. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=90.82s)]
*  Because normally you get a mentally ill person that tries these attacks on them, and they [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=96.1s)]
*  believe they're getting the message directly from Kamala to go do this, that they're doing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=100.74s)]
*  something to save their country. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=104.61999999999999s)]
*  That is such exaggeration. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=107.16s)]
*  And for a campaign to say this is going to be about joy, this is drastically different. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=108.74s)]
*  And this is not the place to close. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=114.96s)]
*  The last thing that puts fear in my mind of why they're doing it is that they want to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=117.0s)]
*  argue about the outcome of the election. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=121.02s)]
*  If their polls were better, would she be saying this? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=123.88s)]
*  That's the real question you want to ask. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=127.16s)]
*  And the question answers itself. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=129.0s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=130.04s)]
*  This is not what they thought they were going to have to be talking about, but here they [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=131.04s)]
*  are. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=133.48s)]
*  But as you mentioned, Mr. Speaker, this is not a new thing for Democrats. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=134.48s)]
*  I think we've got a graphic that shows, I mean, all the way back to Barry Goldwater, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=138.68s)]
*  even before that, Will pointed out, in the Truman race, Republicans have been called [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=142.48s)]
*  Hitler or fascists or tyrants, from Nixon to Reagan to, I mean, Gerald Ford and Mitt [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  Romney are about as moderate as you can get, and they're called Hitler. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  But with Donald Trump, it's different, though. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  Let's be real here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=159.56s)]
*  Those were maybe one-offs. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  This is their slogan. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  This is the blood-red-dripped Independence Hall with the Marines behind them saying it's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=163.83999999999997s)]
*  a threat to democracy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=168.62s)]
*  This is the characterization that they have made. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=170.32s)]
*  There have been two assassination attempts, and they're not going to stop. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=172.6s)]
*  They're not. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=175.4s)]
*  And that's the dangerous part about this. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=176.4s)]
*  When this election is over, you want people to unite. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=178.64s)]
*  All the language they're using right now is they want to keep fighting. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=182.04s)]
*  And when you have two assassination attempts, we do not want the next president of the United [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=185.92s)]
*  States to be fearful of their life every single day. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=190.1s)]
*  What does that do to the entire nation? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=192.88s)]
*  Think about this president who assassination attempt. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  He went back to Butler. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  That was to help heal the nation. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=199.08s)]
*  The other party is encouraging even more of this rhetoric and more direction in the wrong [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=200.88000000000002s)]
*  place that we need at this moment in time. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  For sure. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=208.68s)]
*  Well, Mr. Speaker, I'd be remiss—you know, I don't want to put the cart before the horse [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=209.68s)]
*  here a little bit, but your name has been floated as someone who could potentially, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  should Trump win, be a chief of staff. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=216.96s)]
*  Is that the type of job that would interest you? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=219.0s)]
*  No. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=221.12s)]
*  No. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=222.12s)]
*  No? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=223.12s)]
*  Let me be very clear. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=224.12s)]
*  No. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=225.12s)]
*  I'm not going to be the chief of staff. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=226.12s)]
*  Well, there you go. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=227.12s)]

*  I don't know if he said that before, but that's interesting. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=234.52s)]
*  He'd be good at it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bougVyw3q1E&t=235.52s)]
