# Chicago city meeting EXPLODES into 'total chaos'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk)
*  Now this chaos rubs over far left Chicago mayors. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=0.0s)]
*  $40 million short term loan in next year's $17 billion budget, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=2.7s)]
*  forcing Brandon Johnson to clear the public twice in order to get it passed. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=8.3s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  This meeting will stand in recess. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=15.3s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  After four tries, the budget passed by two votes while Johnson championed the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=25.5s)]
*  spending package as a new way forward for the city. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=29.0s)]
*  What's he talking about? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=32.1s)]
*  Our next guest is one of the 23 aldermen who voted against the budget. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=33.3s)]
*  Anthony Beale joins us now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=37.1s)]
*  Anthony bring us inside the room last night. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=38.5s)]
*  What was it like? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=41.0s)]
*  Well, it was total chaos. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=42.7s)]
*  When you look at everything that you saw just in that segment, it was just total [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=44.2s)]
*  chaos and we're trying to pass a budget. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=48.5s)]
*  We're trying to get real answers. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=51.0s)]
*  We're trying to do what's right by the people of the city of Chicago and we [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=52.3s)]
*  couldn't get real answers from the budget director. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=56.0s)]
*  We couldn't get the right information. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=58.7s)]
*  We needed to make a good educated decision on how to move the city forward [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=60.3s)]
*  and we're still spending money hundreds of millions of dollars on migrants. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=64.7s)]
*  And we want to continue to find and feed the people of the city of Chicago. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=69.4s)]
*  When we continue to spend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars on [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=72.8s)]
*  migrants and there's no end in sight because he doesn't want to cooperate [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=76.2s)]
*  with somebody who couldn't bring that number down by lessening the number [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=79.6s)]
*  coming in. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=82.6s)]
*  In fact, they say in Chicago, the numbers you're giving under Brandon [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=83.5s)]
*  Johnson, the mayor, five hundred and twenty seven point five million [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=87.1s)]
*  dollars, let alone the inconvenience of seeing him in the airports and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=91.3s)]
*  police stations and around. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  I mean, obviously people are fed up. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  Doesn't he hear this? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=98.3s)]
*  Well, we would hope he would hear it, but it doesn't seem like he does. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=100.8s)]
*  We've tried working with this mayor. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=104.3s)]
*  It's about fifteen to sixteen of us who have been around and know the city [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=106.5s)]
*  and know the budget very well and he won't even talk to us. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=110.1s)]
*  He won't even entertain our ideas about trying to right size the city of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=113.8s)]
*  Chicago. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=117.9s)]
*  We tried to right size it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=118.8s)]
*  We tried, you know, our budget is extremely bloated. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=120.10000000000001s)]
*  We've increased our budget over five billion dollars in the last four [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  years. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=128.2s)]
*  We can't sustain that type of growth. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=129.0s)]
*  And so we tried to right size it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=131.2s)]
*  We tried to have cut cuts and efficiencies and this mayor totally ignored [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=132.8s)]
*  all of that and wants to just continue to spend money. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=137.2s)]
*  So Anthony real quick for people outside the city. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=140.3s)]
*  Don't look at the budget. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=142.7s)]
*  You see what else should you what else are you spending things on that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=143.5s)]
*  you shouldn't be? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=147.1s)]
*  Well, when you see that the mayor at the end of the day, he bought about [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  six votes to get his budget passed. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=152.89999999999998s)]
*  He gave Alderman letters that said we're going to do certain things in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=155.6s)]
*  your ward that should be getting done anyway, because it's the right thing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=159.7s)]
*  to do. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=163.7s)]
*  You shouldn't have to hold services back and hold things over people's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=164.0s)]
*  head just to buy their vote. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=167.7s)]
*  People are starving to get things done in their wards and the mayor is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=169.4s)]
*  holding services and goods over their heads in order to get their votes [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=173.3s)]
*  and these people are so desperate to do something for their communities. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, they sold their their vote very cheap. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=180.8s)]
*  But it's almost like they have no options, right? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=184.0s)]
*  It's it's incredible. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=186.10000000000002s)]
*  It's not like your education system is booming and the recreational facilities [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=188.0s)]
*  are fantastic. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=191.8s)]
*  They're not must be really frustrating continue to fight Anthony. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4ouF2qHtk&t=192.60000000000002s)]
