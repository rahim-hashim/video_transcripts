# 'THEY DON'T GET IT': Former Dem fundraiser says party turned its back on Americans
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY)
*  President-elect Donald Trump winning the most popular vote by a Republican candidate ever, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=0.0s)]
*  and Bernie Sanders says Democrats have nobody to blame but themselves. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=6.8s)]
*  The working class of this country is angry, and they have a reason to be angry. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  We are living in an economy today, Donald, where the people on top are doing phenomenally [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=18.8s)]
*  well, while 60% of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=24.12s)]
*  And what Donald Trump did is provided an explanation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=29.720000000000002s)]
*  He went around and said, I know you're angry. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=32.72s)]
*  People were angry. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=36.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, after raising $50 million for Democrats, our next guest stepped away from the Democratic [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=37.32s)]
*  Party after she says it turned its back on her and her family. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=43.36s)]
*  And Evan Barker joins us right now from San Francisco. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=47.84s)]
*  Evan, good morning to you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=50.44s)]
*  Hi, how are you? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=52.44s)]
*  I'm doing okay. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=54.12s)]
*  What a story. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=55.12s)]
*  You're a lifelong Democrat, everybody in your family Democrats. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=56.12s)]
*  You raised $50 million for Democrat candidates, and yet you voted for Donald Trump. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=59.6s)]
*  You're in San Francisco. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=66.24s)]
*  I did. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=67.24s)]
*  What's the reaction from your friends? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=68.24s)]
*  Hey, we thought we knew her. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=69.68s)]
*  She voted for Trump. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  I think I need to go into hiding. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=73.52s)]
*  You're not kidding. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=75.44s)]
*  You know, it's actually, yeah, it's actually been quite brutal. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=77.32s)]
*  I've had friends that I've known for over a decade in the last couple of days that have [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=80.52s)]
*  completely turned their back on me and want nothing to do with me anymore. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=85.96s)]
*  So it's been a hard few days, yet still I do not regret my decision. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=91.24s)]
*  And I don't regret my decision to go public with this information either. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=98.56s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=102.56s)]
*  And you wrote an article for the Free Press. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=103.56s)]
*  And in the article, for folks who have not read it, Evan, you said essentially you gave, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=105.76s)]
*  you raised the middle finger to your own party because they lost, they lost what they, they [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=111.44s)]
*  used to stand for something and now they don't. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=116.64s)]
*  Explain. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  So I originally come from the Kansas City, Missouri area, just like you, as we just discussed. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=122.36000000000001s)]
*  And many people in my family are union members who used to vote Democrat and in the last [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=127.72s)]
*  eight or so years have slowly gone redder and redder. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  And at first I didn't understand why, but especially now after, you know, working in [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=138.96s)]
*  Democratic politics as a fundraiser, living out here, I've noticed that there is a cultural [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=144.16s)]
*  attitude and cultural resentment that many people on the left have towards people in [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=152.44s)]
*  the middle of the country, towards Trump supporters in general. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=158.72s)]
*  I think we saw that very clearly in the final few days of the election when Joe Biden came [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=162.64s)]
*  out on television and called the majority of the country garbage. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=167.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=171.6s)]
*  So, you know, there's been a lot of things that have led to this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=172.6s)]
*  And I think especially in this election, Kamala Harris did not really ever articulate her [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=176.6s)]
*  vision for America's economic future. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=183.11999999999998s)]
*  She didn't really address the pain that people were feeling. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  Instead, she had television show appearances with Oprah Winfrey and the women on The View [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=189.88s)]
*  who just, you know, they just don't get it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  They don't get the pain that people are feeling. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=200.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, while Donald Trump was out there talking directly to people every single day, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=203.12s)]
*  he ran on a platform of economic populism, things that would really benefit the working [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=208.0s)]
*  class and people that I know back home, like no tax on tips. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=213.56s)]
*  No tax on overtime tariffs, which help protect jobs here in the United States. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=218.4s)]
*  And Evan, one other thing I wanted just to touch on, because it's Veterans Day, your [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=227.4s)]
*  stepbrother served in the Navy and sadly was killed when there was a ship collision. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=231.76s)]
*  You did not hear from the Democrat president in the United States. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=239.74s)]
*  You didn't hear from any, your family didn't hear from any Democrats. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=242.44s)]
*  Your family heard from Pat Roberts, the Republican senator from the great state of Kansas. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=246.12s)]
*  He's the one who sat with your family and talked about your stepbrother for an hour [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=252.68s)]
*  about his life. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=257.04s)]
*  And John McCain called your family. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=258.16s)]
*  You didn't hear anything from the Democrats. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=259.76s)]
*  No, and we were also invited to the White House Christmas party when Donald Trump was [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=263.0s)]
*  in office, or sorry, not Christmas party, the White House Halloween party when Donald [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=268.8s)]
*  Trump was in office in 2017. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=272.72s)]
*  Ironically, my brother was a janitor in Barack Obama's state office when he was a state senator [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=276.0s)]
*  in Illinois. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  And he ended up joining the Navy in 2008 after he worked as a janitor. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  And I actually reached out to the Obama Foundation during that time. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=289.12s)]
*  And through my contacts in Democratic politics, trying to reach him, hoping that he might [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=293.44s)]
*  remember my brother. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=297.47999999999996s)]
*  Perhaps he could send a letter to his two children. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=299.76s)]
*  They were six and eight at the time when he tragically passed away on a very preventable [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=303.2s)]
*  death. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=307.64s)]
*  And I never heard anything from them. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=309.08s)]
*  And I think that that, you know, I know he's a busy guy and everything, but just in general [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=311.24s)]
*  during that time, I felt like I had a lot more empathy from people on the right than [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  I did from people on the left. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=322.96s)]
*  And that was a very confusing thing for me as a lifelong Democrat. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=324.64s)]
*  Well, and now you're going to change your official party registration to independent. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=328.52s)]
*  Joining us from San Francisco today, Evan Barker, if you want to read her piece, it's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  in the free press and it's terrific. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=338.28s)]
*  Evan, thank you very much. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=340.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY9kcOgvUMY&t=342.2s)]
