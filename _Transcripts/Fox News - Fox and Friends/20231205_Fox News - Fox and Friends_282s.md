# Israel reportedly considering flooding Hamas tunnels
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE)
*  Good morning, everybody. It's Tuesday, December 5th, 2023, and we start this first hour of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=0.0s)]
*  Fox and Friends with a Fox News alert again. The Israeli Defense Forces say they have raided [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=6.0s)]
*  Hamas's General Security headquarters overnight. They're now surrounding other areas of interest [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  in northern Gaza. And this comes as the Israeli government is reportedly considering flooding [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=17.88s)]
*  the terrorist groups' tunnels with the Mediterranean seawater. Wow, you're just going to find out [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=23.84s)]
*  the hostages are there, though, right? Trey Yanks is live in southern Israel. Trey. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=29.2s)]
*  Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. We are following this report from the Wall Street Journal [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=35.56s)]
*  indicating that Israel is considering flooding the tunnel network at least of northern Gaza [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=39.08s)]
*  with seawater from the Mediterranean Sea. They have reportedly placed five large pumps [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=44.68s)]
*  near the Shati camp in the northern part of Gaza, and they're waiting to see if they'll [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=50.2s)]
*  actually move forward with this plan. But it is significant to discuss because if they do [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  this, it would destroy the tunnel network, but it also risks damaging significant infrastructure [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=59.16s)]
*  across Gaza and possibly damaging the fresh water that civilians use to drink there. With [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=64.0s)]
*  that said, Israeli forces still operating in the northern part of the strip. They say [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  they were able to target Hamas's General Security headquarters overnight near the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=74.72s)]
*  Jubilee neighborhood. Soldiers from two separate units locating rockets and weapons in this [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=79.44s)]
*  area before calling in airstrikes. Israel is expected to complete offensive operations in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=84.48s)]
*  northern Gaza in the coming weeks. Also in recent hours, Israel ramped up its campaign [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=89.56s)]
*  against southern Gaza. Their efforts focused around the city of Hanunis, where residents [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=94.08s)]
*  say last night's airstrikes were some of the heaviest since the war began. A source in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=98.44s)]
*  the southern city of Rafa telling Fox News that cell service was temporarily cut in Gaza [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=103.16s)]
*  as the operation ramped up. Now, amid this new push in the second phase of the war, the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=108.36s)]
*  civilian death toll in Gaza is rising rapidly and there are new concerns about the possibility [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=112.72000000000001s)]
*  of more Iranian regional activity against Israel and its allies. In a quote, a spokesman [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  for the Foreign Ministry in Iran said, no action against Iran, its interests or our [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  advisory forces will go unanswered. A clear threat against Israel and the United States [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=129.12s)]
*  in the region. As we do know, the Israelis are striking Hezbollah targets today in southern [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  Lebanon after new fire in northern Israel. Guys back to you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=139.48s)]
*  So Trey, are there corridors for people to escape out, being that they're moving south [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=143.2s)]
*  and they told everyone to move south? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=148.44s)]
*  So the Israelis have released a new detailed map that actually breaks down the Gaza strip [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=153.12s)]
*  into hundreds of different sectors, and they are using both leaflet drops, phone calls [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=157.72s)]
*  and alerts on this site to tell people to move to safer areas. The issue here is that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=163.0s)]
*  no area in Gaza is safe. They do have a small strip of land, they say is a humanitarian [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=168.92s)]
*  safe zone. But other than that, they are bombing the entirety of the Gaza strip. So they are [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  telling people to move south. But there are more than two million civilians in Gaza and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=178.6s)]
*  they are simply running out of places to go. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=182.32s)]
*  Yeah. And Trey, regarding your lead story about how, according to The Wall Street Journal, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=184.32s)]
*  it sounds like the Israelis are thinking about flooding the tunnels with seawater from the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=188.64s)]
*  Mediterranean. But that could endanger the freshwater in Gaza. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=192.44s)]
*  Is there a possibility that is just a a head fake? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=196.88s)]
*  Hey, we're going to do this in hopes that they move people out of the tunnels because [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=202.28s)]
*  the last thing Israel wants is to be accused of destroying their water supply. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=206.68s)]
*  Yeah, we're so far into this conflict. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=214.32s)]
*  60 days in, it's challenging to know exactly what they're thinking is behind this process [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=216.92s)]
*  because you raise a great point. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=222.28s)]
*  Some of the hostages that are still in Gaza are likely held in the tunnel system beneath [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=224.0s)]
*  the strip. And so they flood those tunnels. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=228.0s)]
*  They risk killing the hostages. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=230.04s)]
*  And so it's a it's an incredibly challenging decision to make on top of the fact that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  they've already destroyed quite a bit of civilian infrastructure in Gaza. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=236.0s)]
*  And there is this question about the day after the war, they will have to deal with a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=239.28s)]
*  civilian population on their border that is facing a humanitarian crisis. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=243.92s)]
*  So damaging the freshwater system in Gaza will be yet another headache for the Israelis [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=247.92s)]
*  to deal with. And they will face renewed international pressure. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=253.12s)]
*  Even today, the World Health Organization raising flags saying, look, the the situation [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=255.96s)]
*  in Gaza is getting worse by the hour. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=260.8s)]
*  And they need to remember that as the war continues and the ground and air campaign [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=262.88s)]
*  continues against the strip, you've still got two million civilians that are living [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=267.08s)]
*  there. I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNl0nDwkrZE&t=270.6s)]
