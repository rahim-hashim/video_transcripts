# All the heads in the room will turn to Kamala Harris: KT McFarland
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg)
*  All right, a Fox News alert. Joe Biden is leaving Delaware. That's a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=0.0s)]
*  For the White House, where he and Vice President Kamala Harris will meet with the team negotiating [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=7.04s)]
*  a hostage deal. Remember, there are four Americans still believed to be alive and held by Hamas [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=12.18s)]
*  in Gaza. Earlier, we spoke to the father of one of them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=18.76s)]
*  The time is over for sort of selling, perpetuating this fantasy of total victory over Hamas, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=23.84s)]
*  based on the sacrifice of our sons, daughters, grandparents, who are hostages in Gaza. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=32.24s)]
*  Here to react, former Trump Deputy National Security Advisor KT McFarland. KT, thanks [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=41.16s)]
*  for being here. You can understand a father who's still got a child in the hands of Hamas [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  wanting that kid back. I get that. But, you know, a leader like Bibi Netanyahu has to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=51.4s)]
*  weigh the collective defense of a nation and the existence of Hamas. What should they do? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=56.4s)]
*  If you were in his seat, you know, and you're getting mixed signals from the U.S., what [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=62.04s)]
*  does Israel do? You know, I think President Trump probably [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=68.24s)]
*  said it best. He said, finish it, but finish it quickly. And time is running out for Bibi [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=72.44s)]
*  Netanyahu, not time in the sense of military time, but political time. You know, the White [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=79.0s)]
*  House, I'm sure, is pressuring him, go for a ceasefire, go for a ceasefire. He obviously [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=82.68s)]
*  has domestic opposition. Half of the country rose up to say, get the hostages out. The [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=87.16s)]
*  problem is Hamas has said no hostages without a ceasefire. And Israel knows, you sign that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  ceasefire, then Hamas lives to fight another day. They haven't destroyed, Israel has not [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=98.08s)]
*  destroyed those tunnels, which is where those hostages were killed just a few days ago. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=103.16s)]
*  The tunnels that go from Ra'afah into Israel. So you're making an invitation for the next [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=108.0s)]
*  crisis, which is another massacre of Israelis. It's a terrible position that Bibi Netanyahu [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=112.84s)]
*  is in. But I've got to tell you, Pete, I've been in that White House Situation Room for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=118.12s)]
*  those meetings. The White House Situation Room is about the side of a big dining room, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=121.8s)]
*  and the president sits at one end of the table. He'll get his briefing from the hostage [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=126.28s)]
*  negotiators. And then he's going to turn to the secretary of defense, who's going [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=130.8s)]
*  situation. We have American military in the region. Then he's going to turn to the secretary [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=135.08s)]
*  of state and say, well, what's the Israeli position? Then he's going to turn to the intelligence [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=139.28s)]
*  director and say, what do we know about Israel's capabilities, about Iran's capabilities in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=142.68s)]
*  this? Is Iran going to get involved? He goes all around the table. And then every head [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=147.84s)]
*  turns to the president waiting for his decision. And we have now got Joe Biden, who's been [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  on vacation for two weeks, and he's going to make the decision. Then every other head [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  is going to turn to the vice president and say, well, you want to be in this seat. You [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=160.44s)]
*  want to be in the Situation Room in a couple months' time. What would your decision be? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=163.52s)]
*  And I think that's when you have dead silence. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  That's right. I want to help me answer that question. What is Kamala Harris's foreign [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=169.96s)]
*  policy? Because Joe is who he is, and his capabilities are what they are. But you're [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  right. Those heads are going to turn to her increasingly because she's running for that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=181.28s)]
*  job. Where does she stand? Is she more interested in winning votes in Michigan than having a [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=184.68s)]
*  good outcome for an ally here? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, I think she has a two-state solution for the Middle East problem, which [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=192.72s)]
*  is Minnesota and Michigan. She wants to get those voters. She wants to get those anti-Israel [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=196.16s)]
*  Muslim voters to vote for her, because she thinks that's going to get her in the White [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=200.36s)]
*  House. The problem is, once you get in the White House, you have to make the tough calls. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=203.68s)]
*  And there is no good, easy solution to this, whether you're the head of Israel, whether [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=208.52s)]
*  you're head of the United States. I guess if you're the head of Hamas, you've got [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=213.0s)]
*  the solution, which is you want to get immunity. You want to get away with it so you can live [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=216.36s)]
*  and fight another day. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=220.34s)]
*  That's exactly right. It is an impossible situation, which is why you need qualified, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=222.24s)]
*  capable, sharp folks around that table. And that is not what we've had for a very long [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=228.44s)]
*  time. KT McFarland, I really appreciate your insight here. Thank you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=233.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=238.88s)]
*  You got it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx06r5DlCYg&t=239.4s)]
