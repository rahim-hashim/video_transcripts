# GOP rep who helped Helene victims warns official death toll is ‘extremely’ low
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8)
*  President Trump ripping Biden Harris over their response [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=0.0s)]
*  to Haleen victims while praising the efforts of our next guest [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=3.12s)]
*  during his triumphant return to Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=7.0s)]
*  Cory Mills, he's out there fighting too. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=10.92s)]
*  He's out there. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=13.08s)]
*  He is out there in North Carolina, Georgia. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=14.56s)]
*  He's out there helping people. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=18.52s)]
*  We have to send our prayers and support to all the families [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=20.28s)]
*  affected by Hurricane Haleen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=23.64s)]
*  This has been the worst hurricane response [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=27.2s)]
*  by a president and vice president since Katrina, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=29.16s)]
*  and this is simply not acceptable. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=31.88s)]
*  Congressman Cory Mills was at the rally yesterday [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=35.24s)]
*  and on the ground this week distributing needed supplies, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=37.24s)]
*  and he joins us now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=39.84s)]
*  Congressman, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=40.84s)]
*  Your work in North Carolina has been well documented [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=42.72s)]
*  if you are on social media. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  I think those that watch Fox have also seen, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=47.92s)]
*  you've literally been in the middle of it this week. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=50.6s)]
*  So tell me what some of what you've seen in North Carolina. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=53.16s)]
*  Well, as you can see, North Carolina was absolutely [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  devastated by this storm. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=61.2s)]
*  It wasn't just the increase in the rising water, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=62.56s)]
*  but the mudslides as well in some of the upper mountain areas. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=65.12s)]
*  Our team had traveled everywhere from Asheville [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=68.28s)]
*  as the main veterans charity driven distribution center, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  out to Broad River, out to Pensacola, North Carolina, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=74.44s)]
*  which has got about a 5,200 elevation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  We've gone out to Burnsville. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  We've been at Elk River, Banner Elk. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=82.04s)]
*  We've been in Chelo. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=84.2s)]
*  We've been at, I mean, across the Western North Carolina area [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  delivering over 22,000 pounds with two helicopters [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=87.72s)]
*  and a hoist operation into these more hard hit areas [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=91.48s)]
*  and remote and isolated areas. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=95.08s)]
*  So, and again, well, this isn't just food, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  waters and non-perishable diapers, et cetera, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=99.56s)]
*  but medications. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  We have to keep in mind that you've got type one diabetics [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=103.16s)]
*  who need insulin. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=106.08s)]
*  You have people who are on oxygen [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=107.0s)]
*  who are gonna need renewals in their oxygen bottles. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  And many of these roads were devastated and cut off. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=111.0s)]
*  So we're going in on Medivacs. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=113.12s)]
*  We've actually rescued a gentleman recently [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=115.8s)]
*  from Bailey, North Carolina, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=116.8s)]
*  transferred him to Johnson City. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=118.48s)]
*  Just got an update from his cousin [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=120.16s)]
*  that the doctors had even told him, said, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=121.72s)]
*  if you were here, 30 minutes difference, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=124.08s)]
*  you wouldn't be here with us today. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=127.04s)]
*  So it's absolutely devastating what's going on there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=128.72s)]
*  I think the death count and the fatality count [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=131.56s)]
*  is extremely high compared to, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=133.48s)]
*  or low compared to what the reality is on the ground. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=135.08s)]
*  They're reporting about 220. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=137.8s)]
*  I've talked to nurses and others in hospitals. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=139.2s)]
*  They're saying it's around 405 [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=141.2s)]
*  and they're even requesting more body bags. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=142.76s)]
*  Right now, after we've gotten outside of that window, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  we're gonna go from what was a rescue [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=147.28s)]
*  to recovery at this point. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=149.04s)]
*  And I talked to Chief Harrison [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=150.24s)]
*  in Pensacola, North Carolina, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=152.16s)]
*  who watched two of his residents go down the river [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=153.28s)]
*  that he was unable to recover the bodies. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=156.24s)]
*  He said, well, he said, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=157.64s)]
*  we're gonna actually be recovering bodies [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=158.96s)]
*  throughout the end of the year. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=160.72s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=162.04s)]
*  You know, Congressman, I don't have a lot of time [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=163.24s)]
*  left with you, but I wanna try to cover the concept [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=164.76s)]
*  of leadership for just one minute. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=166.48s)]
*  And I have two places I wanna go with you. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=167.76s)]
*  I know from some personal experience [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=169.84s)]
*  and I know through knowing you and watching you as well, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=171.8s)]
*  that there is the correct way to lead. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  And what we have seen, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  and I am not giving you a gratuitous compliment, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  is a form of leadership that is necessary [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=180.96s)]
*  in a chaotic environment. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  And I would assume, you know, logistics needs, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  even defining needs is difficult in the initial phases. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  How do you lead? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  Because from my perspective, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=193.88000000000002s)]
*  it's just, you just jump in, to be honest. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=195.24s)]
*  You have to start just jumping in. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=197.68s)]
*  You can't sit back and, oh my gosh, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=199.24s)]
*  what's the plan? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=201.2s)]
*  What's the bureaucracy? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=202.04s)]
*  You gotta dive into the chaos. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=203.0s)]
*  Leaders get on the ground and they figure it out. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=206.56s)]
*  They start getting to the actual problems [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=208.32s)]
*  and they actually start finding solutions. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=210.16s)]
*  You work your A through Z, you work your tertiary plans, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  you start getting communication networks together. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=214.44s)]
*  You start looking at other organizations. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=216.44s)]
*  Look, you know this all too well. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  You've been covering me for a while, Will, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=219.44s)]
*  whether it's Afghanistan in 2021, Israel in 2023, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=220.89999999999998s)]
*  Haiti in 2024, or now North Carolina, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=224.0s)]
*  and then hopefully, not too badly, Florida. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  I've been at the crux of every single one of these [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  because I believe that as an elected official, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=230.84s)]
*  we have to do more to represent the people [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=232.6s)]
*  and be there for them. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=234.48s)]
*  And I don't see that, whether it's through the GOP [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=235.32s)]
*  or the Democrat party. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  The federal government needs to step up [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=239.04s)]
*  and the state government needs to step up [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=240.44s)]
*  and help the people. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=241.8s)]
*  So last question, because I'm over time, Congressman, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=242.74s)]
*  but I wanna take your form of leadership, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=244.6s)]
*  your example of leadership, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=246.4s)]
*  and just apply it to how it's failing the people [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=247.6s)]
*  in North Carolina. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=249.8s)]
*  Is it because it's fat, bloated, and incompetent [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=250.8s)]
*  that it can't dive in and do what we just described? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=253.24s)]
*  Or is it because they don't have the right priorities? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=256.2s)]
*  I think there's an unwillingness. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=259.85999999999996s)]
*  I think there's a wrong priority list [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=260.94s)]
*  where they're prioritizing DEI or meritocracy [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=262.64s)]
*  and get things to the ground. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=264.78s)]
*  I think if you look at FEMA, for example, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=265.62s)]
*  they allocated money for immigration resettlement, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=267.41999999999996s)]
*  not for national disaster relief and rescue and recovery. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=269.58s)]
*  And so I think that we have to go ahead [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iohCToPnuZ8&t=272.41999999999996s)]
