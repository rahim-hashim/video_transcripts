# Noem, Homan may be 'attending a funeral' if anti-ICE rhetoric continues, warns Jim Trusty
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw)
*  Well, Fox News learning one of the men charged after the ambush at an ice facility in Alvarado, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=0.0s)]
*  Texas, entered the country illegally over 20 years ago and was granted a green card [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=5.44s)]
*  under the Biden administration. Meanwhile, four more people who tried to sabotage an ice operation [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=9.6s)]
*  with homemade tire spikes have been arrested in California. Here to talk about it, former Trump DOJ [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=14.8s)]
*  prosecutor Jim Trusty. Jim, good morning. Let's go to this case in Alvarado, Texas. We're learning [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=20.96s)]
*  more and more, particularly about this individual that was a DACA recipient, green card holder. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=27.76s)]
*  Where do you see this prosecution going and what do we need to know about it? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=34.88s)]
*  Yeah, well, the DACA guy is a little bit of a separate strand. You know, you have 10 people [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  that were engaged in a highly premeditated ambush of an ice facility and ice agents. They set up a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  lure by vandalizing, by shooting fireworks. When the agents started to come out, they shot 20 to 30 [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=53.12s)]
*  rounds with AR-15. So starting point on that part of the case is I'd very much like to see a plead [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=59.28s)]
*  to the sheep mentality by the prosecutors. In other words, saying, hey, you've got attempted [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=66.32s)]
*  murder charges, you've got firearm charges, you can plead guilty to everything and beg the judge [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=70.8s)]
*  for mercy, but you're not getting it from me. I think that might be the tone that gets taken by [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=74.8s)]
*  the U.S. Attorney's office in North Texas. This guy, Sanchez Estrada, was kind of an outlier to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=79.12s)]
*  it in that he was the spouse of one of the people involved in the ambush. The spouse called him and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  said, hey, they might be coming your way. He apparently tried to get rid of a bunch of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=90.48s)]
*  hateful literature that was inside the house. So he's charged with kind of a lower grade [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  offense, an obstruction type offense. The DACA stuff, you know, look, it's obviously newsworthy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  He also renewed his DACA status a couple of times during other administrations. I don't think it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=104.8s)]
*  rises to the level of the outrage that you see in my state, Maryland, where young women are [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=110.88s)]
*  raped and murdered by illegal aliens that never should have been here. But that's obviously, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=116.96s)]
*  you know, yet another moment of the immigration system failing to protect the community. But [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=122.56s)]
*  again, the primary thing to worry about is the fact that 10 people would come together and decide [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=127.2s)]
*  it's time to murder ICE agents, shooting one in the neck. I'm very worried that Kristi Noem and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=133.2s)]
*  Tom Holman are going to be attending a funeral if we don't find a way to change the mentality [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=139.2s)]
*  that's spreading around this country about ICE. That is absolutely the concern of every border [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=143.83999999999997s)]
*  and immigration official out there. And, you know, specifically with this case, this was, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  was this, I'll ask you, in your opinion, a coordinated premeditated attack. You had 10 [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=155.92s)]
*  individuals with AR style rifles, body armor, they had two way radios, they even had cell phones in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=160.64s)]
*  a Faraday bag, which is used to conceal communication. Yeah, they had body armor, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=167.11999999999998s)]
*  12 suits of body armor for this group as well. And look, the actions tell you that it was [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  coordinated, right? It makes sense. This was a lure, like, let's get these guys to come out and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=178.72s)]
*  we're going to go after them. But beyond that, right now, the investigation is undoubtedly going [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=182.88s)]
*  to recover communications between them, at least most likely. And those communications will kind of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=187.6s)]
*  cement the deal that this was an absolutely coordinated premeditated heinous act by five [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=192.4s)]
*  men and five women in particular that knew exactly what they were in for when they showed up at that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=198.24s)]
*  ICE facility. Jim, let me turn here a little bit to Kilmar Arbringo Garcia. Judge Paul Azenis [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=203.2s)]
*  expected today to weigh in on whether or not the DOJ must announce its witness to basically [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=210.4s)]
*  detail what the government, the administration plans to do with him should be released. Your thoughts? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=219.52s)]
*  Yeah, this is more kind of judicially assisted lawfare chaos. That's the short version. The [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=226.16s)]
*  slightly longer version is this. You know, he has human smuggling charges in Nashville. The magistrate [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  judge has basically said, I think we can actually cut him loose on these charges, let him be on some [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=237.36s)]
*  conditions of home confinement, etc., where he'll show up for court without being incarcerated. But [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=243.12s)]
*  normally what that would mean in this case is that the ICE detainer kicks in, he's taken into ICE [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  custody and quite possibly removed soon. Judge Azenis in Maryland has a kind of parallel fight going [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=254.0s)]
*  on where the ACLU lawyers are actually asking her, can you order Nashville to send them here [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=260.8s)]
*  because we're worried ICE is about to deport him. In fact, they've asked the judge to not release [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=266.56s)]
*  him too quickly from Nashville because they want to litigate a bunch of stuff in Maryland. And look, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  short version, in Maryland it looks like the judge is taking things very personally, that she's [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=275.76s)]
*  frustrated with the DOJ representation and the response. She's ordering things like an ICE [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=280.56s)]
*  official to come to court in Greenbelt, Maryland to explain what's going to happen next. I think [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  this is the kind of stuff where the Supreme Court eventually once again might say, hey, look, we're [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=290.96s)]
*  not going to have 700 district court judges micromanaging the executive branch and shut it [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=295.76s)]
*  down. But in the meantime, plenty of litigation, plenty of chaos and kind of a tug of war between [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=300.32s)]
*  Nashville and Maryland about where this guy's going to be. Chaos, probably the right word there. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=305.36s)]
*  We'll see where it goes. Jim, trustee, thank you. All right, thanks, Griff. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cxB51rZCw&t=310.0s)]
