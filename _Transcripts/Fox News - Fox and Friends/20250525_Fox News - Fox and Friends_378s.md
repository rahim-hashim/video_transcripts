**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE)
*  So you're looking live at the Snake Pit here at the Indy 500. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=0.0s)]
*  And the party's already rocking thanks to our next guest. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=6.68s)]

*  Yes, I really do. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=22.48s)]
*  You know, there's all the pit announcers. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=23.64s)]
*  You can be up in the booth breaking down the race, but I got the best job. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=25.48s)]
*  I'm the Grand Marshall of the Snake Pit. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=28.6s)]
*  It's kind of like the closest thing, the Woodstock back in the day, I hear. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=30.96s)]
*  So it's going to be a party. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=34.68s)]
*  It's going to be a lot of fun and people are going to be going absolutely crazy and I'm [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=35.68s)]
*  going to be egging it on. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=39.72s)]
*  So you've been learning a lot about this race, getting all the sights, all the sounds. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=41.52s)]
*  We were talking a little bit off the mom and me is coming up. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  Gronk was actually saying this is the cleanest place ever. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=49.36s)]
*  Yes, it actually is for how big it is and all the stands. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=52.64s)]
*  Like the stands look beautiful. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=56.24s)]
*  The grass is green. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  It's not all muddy all over the place with so many people here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=59.44s)]
*  It's just really cool. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=62.48s)]
*  The speculation here for all the fans is just wonderful. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=63.72s)]
*  And I'm pumped to be here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=67.36s)]
*  I wasn't sure what I was getting into, but it's given me the chills and it's just, you [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=68.44s)]
*  know, feels good to be around this atmosphere. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=72.8s)]
*  So you didn't you haven't been a lifelong racing fan, but you hung out with some of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=75.24s)]
*  the drivers last night. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=79.32s)]
*  They're like truly elite athletes in order to drive some of these cars. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=81.6s)]
*  240 miles an hour around this track. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=85.76s)]
*  Yes, you've got to be an elite in the elite athlete in order to be able to be a driver [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=87.56s)]
*  here at the Indy 500. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=91.84s)]
*  And the training is phenomenal. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=93.16s)]
*  These guys train. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=95.52s)]
*  I was talking to Alex Pelo yesterday from Spain, who has never won the Indy 500, but [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=96.68s)]
*  he has won plenty of the other championships. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=101.48s)]
*  Four out of five coming in. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=103.52s)]
*  Yes. And he's I'm cheering for him to win today because he was such a humble guy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=104.64s)]
*  He was such a great guy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=108.84s)]
*  And he taught me so much about the sport last night when I was talking to him. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=110.0s)]
*  So I'm really, really cheering for him to win today and what they do to, you know, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=113.64s)]
*  become, you know, the racers that they are, the hard work that they put in, the workouts [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  that they go through. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=123.24s)]
*  They're vigorous. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=124.36s)]
*  And it's kind of like being a professional football player with how much they train. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=125.2s)]
*  And it's really cool to hear it from him, especially live in person last night when [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=129.44s)]
*  I was talking to him. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=133.44s)]
*  You think you can get one of these cars and drive it? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=134.04s)]
*  I don't think so because I'm too big. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=135.28s)]
*  My knees will be going through the steering wheel. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=136.68s)]
*  Yeah, but I think I think you're rooting for Pelo because he gave you this is your [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=138.36s)]
*  helmet for the snake pit with your name. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=142.84s)]
*  Yes, check it out. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=145.72s)]
*  And I hear a lot about the snake pit. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=146.8s)]
*  So I'm going to make sure I'm wearing that helmet because I'm sure it's going to be [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=148.96s)]
*  like a parade in Boston where beers are going to be thrown at me. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=152.6s)]
*  She little, you know, those nipple shot glasses shots will be thrown at me as well. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=155.68s)]
*  So I'm going to have protection on my head so I don't get knocked out. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=160.2s)]
*  What did he tell you when you had that conversation with him? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=162.76s)]
*  What did he tell you about the sport that that really surprised you? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=167.32s)]
*  Oh, that's a really good question. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=171.16s)]
*  You know how he works together with his team and how fast, you know, the pit is. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=174.0s)]
*  Well, what is it when they get the oil, their gasoline, the pit crew and how fast [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=178.96s)]
*  they operate, it's six to seven seconds to change the tires and fill up the gas. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=184.08s)]
*  When I heard that it takes six seconds to put in 15 to 20 gallons of gas in your car, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm like, wait a second. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=193.08s)]
*  Like, how is that possible? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  But they have it down to a science. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=195.56s)]
*  And that just blew my mind just how much work they put in together as a team. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  And how much of a team effort it is, even though he's driving around the course [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  by himself, he still needs him, his team to be at top of his game. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=205.24s)]
*  Yeah. Speaking of going around the course, truth told here, are you jealous? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=209.52s)]
*  Your pal Tom Brady got to go real fast with Jimmy Johnson. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=214.0s)]
*  Here's a little bit of what he put on Instagram. All right. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=218.12s)]
*  All right, TV, are you going to go in the car after you see how fast he goes right now? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  You still got to do it with him. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  It depends. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=229.52s)]
*  I want to see how good he actually is. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=231.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=233.08s)]
*  There we can go out by the wall over here, then you'll see it go by. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  I know he's seven times champion, even seven times champion. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=237.28s)]
*  You guys never never stop talking smack. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=241.4s)]
*  No, no, especially Tom, except since he retired, Tom took his talking [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=244.0s)]
*  smack game to a whole new level. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=248.72s)]
*  And I absolutely love it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  And I was actually with Tom all yesterday when we got to meet Alex Palo. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=251.84s)]
*  We were with Jeter as well and Strahan. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=256.36s)]
*  And it was just such a cool situation. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=258.28s)]
*  And then they went off and did their lap around the race course. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=260.48s)]
*  But he went hang hung out with Jimmy Johnson to do the lap. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=263.88s)]
*  Well, I got to hang out with Jimmy Johnson all last year. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=266.52s)]
*  He was he just retired on the Fox pregame set. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=269.2s)]
*  He just retired this year. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=272.48s)]
*  So I got to always be hanging out with the real Jimmy Johnson. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=273.56s)]
*  So I would be jealous of Tom, but not in that situation. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=276.76s)]
*  Tom can't party like you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=280.6s)]
*  He can't party like me. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=282.84s)]
*  He can't handle the snake pit. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=284.28s)]
*  No, he can't. I was actually talking to his assistant yesterday. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=285.52s)]
*  We're like, hey, we're going to have to spike his drink or something [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  to get him into that mood. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  Have him come over to the snake pit to get in the DJ booth and just start, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  you know, rocking out. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=296.28s)]
*  We would never do that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=298.0s)]
*  I just want to let you know, there is a a Christian ministry [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=299.2s)]
*  and there's a priest offering confessions right down there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=302.76s)]
*  So after the snake pit, you might have to go to spike it with a little caffeine. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=305.68s)]
*  The guy is caffeine. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=309.96s)]
*  So if he finally has some caffeine, he'd be going crazy and he'd be up. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=311.64s)]
*  You know, snake pit stage just EDMing out. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=315.24s)]
*  We can't wait to see it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  And you wearing the helmet as well. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=321.68s)]
*  That's going to be great. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=323.32s)]
*  I need protection. Oh, yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  We got to see that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=325.92s)]
*  We got to see that for sure. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=326.71999999999997s)]

*  In fact, our viewers can catch every second of it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=333.76s)]
*  Let's hold on. Let's take a look here. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2dWE77eyBE&t=336.32s)]
