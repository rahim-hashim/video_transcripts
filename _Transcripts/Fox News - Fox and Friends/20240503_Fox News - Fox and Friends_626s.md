# 'View' host concerned about 'perfect scenario' for Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8)
*  All right, meanwhile, this has been one of the craziest week ever. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=0.0s)]
*  You were watching campus after campus. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I'm talking about the University of Wisconsin. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=5.0s)]
*  You're talking about out in Berkeley. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=7.92s)]
*  You're talking about UCLA, USC, University of Texas, Austin, and then you have MIT Brown. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=9.56s)]
*  Wherever you look, there's been campus after campus into chaos. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=14.68s)]
*  In fact, they say it's been in 26 states. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=18.48s)]
*  And the one thing is pretty clear. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=22.68s)]
*  They seem to have the same game plan. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=24.28s)]
*  Get some pup tents. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=26.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=27.52s)]
*  Build an encampment. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=28.52s)]
*  Get some material to do it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=29.52s)]
*  And there seems to be plenty of resources and money to make it happen. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=30.8s)]
*  Well, it used to be the guidelines for all of these liberals and progressives with the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=34.36s)]
*  protesters that they would use all of Linsky's rules of radicals. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=39.28s)]
*  Now they've gotten real tailored. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=43.68s)]
*  This is Crime Think website. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=45.739999999999995s)]
*  And this is what they're saying. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=47.04s)]
*  This is one of the quotes there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=48.04s)]
*  It's clear that in order for this crisis to develop further, students' occupation should [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=49.68s)]
*  take buildings whenever possible. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=53.72s)]
*  We can wield the most power by occupying the spaces where classes are held and administrators [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=56.66s)]
*  have offices. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=62.62s)]
*  Another quote says this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=64.7s)]
*  Be prepared to escalate your action in order to continue to make it more expensive, whether [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=65.94s)]
*  materially, financially, or socially, to remain complicit than to divest their endowments [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=73.3s)]
*  from Israel. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=79.25999999999999s)]
*  So they're making it very clear of what to do. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=80.25999999999999s)]
*  Take the building. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=83.24s)]
*  These are all legal actions. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=84.24s)]
*  But the one thing that continues is that they all go to that site. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=85.94s)]
*  They go to that site. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=89.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=90.06s)]
*  But they keep saying divest from Israel. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=91.06s)]
*  I don't understand what they mean by that when you have a lot of these companies that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=92.7s)]
*  are giving the university money. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=98.46s)]
*  They give Israel money as well, but they're writing scholarships. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  So they want, I guess, the taxpayers to pay for the college, but they don't want these [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=104.74s)]
*  Boeing to pay for the university kids, those scholarships. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=109.02s)]
*  I think the real, you see the level of organization going on here, Lawrence. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=112.9s)]
*  You see these websites. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=117.62s)]
*  You saw at the University of Chicago that Bill Ayers went to give aid and support. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=119.38s)]
*  Chicago Underground. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=125.74s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=126.74s)]
*  The Weather Underground. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=127.74s)]
*  He's a domestic terrorist. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=129.98s)]
*  He firebombed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=131.54s)]
*  You remember back when Sean Hannity was trying to warn America about the connection between [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=132.9s)]
*  Bill Ayers and Barack Obama. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  What you're seeing now is the fruits of a lot of that work right here on this campus. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=140.29999999999998s)]
*  So I think what we're seeing is that the FBI should actually be looking into who is funding [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  this because these are people who are aligning with former domestic terrorist groups. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=151.66s)]
*  These are Marxists. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=158.06s)]
*  These are people who are anti-American. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=159.06s)]
*  You see that in the form of their protests. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=161.42s)]
*  They're people who just want to really cause a lot of disruption. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=164.98s)]
*  Uniformity. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=168.86s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=169.86s)]
*  It's coordinated. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=170.86s)]
*  Where's the FBI? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=171.86s)]
*  You mentioned Bill Ayers. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=172.86s)]
*  I mean, he and his group bombed the Pentagon, bombed the State Department, bombed NYPD [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=173.86s)]
*  headquarters decades ago. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=179.02s)]
*  He is an admitted, unrepentant terrorist. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=180.26000000000002s)]
*  So it makes sense that he would be an inspiration to these Hamas supporters. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=182.78s)]
*  So of course he showed up at the encampment at University of Chicago. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=185.74s)]
*  The difference is that now the FBI and all the upper echelons of our government are now [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=188.18s)]
*  stacked with all these boomers that were allies of his back in the day. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=192.74s)]
*  But why was it that the governors and mayors were going to let this happen? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=198.17999999999998s)]
*  It's almost as if they were on the same website that they know, back up, let it happen. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=201.1s)]
*  But they were not counting on the fact that by taking a building that's a criminal action, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=205.82s)]
*  that is going to spur law enforcement to get in there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=210.17999999999998s)]
*  The Columbia thing backfired in their face. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  That put them on the clock. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=215.33999999999997s)]
*  I think they would have been compliant with that encampment still existing today, canceling [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=216.54s)]
*  their commencement address and being fine with it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=221.5s)]
*  But when you took the building, you're talking about a criminal action. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=223.7s)]
*  The other thing to keep in mind is the money that was provided. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  Did you see when we left the air yesterday and they were able to look at this stuff, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=230.7s)]
*  do you see the coolers? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=234.7s)]
*  They had a whole medical team. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=235.7s)]
*  They were all set up to last weeks. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=237.76s)]
*  Who wrote the checks for the plywood? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  Who got the zip ties? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=242.42s)]
*  Who got all the coolers? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=243.42s)]
*  Who got all the food? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=244.42s)]
*  Where's the money coming from? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=245.42s)]
*  The medical products were addressed to the university as well. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=246.42s)]
*  So who allowed them to have it? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=249.98s)]
*  I would like to know that also there's this major Iranian university that is now offering [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=252.02s)]
*  scholarships for the people that are expelled from the university. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=257.82s)]
*  Actually, they should go to Iran. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=263.18s)]
*  They should go to Iran and see what it's like to be there with their gender studies degree. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=264.78000000000003s)]
*  And I just can't get past all the transgender flags that are at these protests that I attend. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=268.94s)]
*  Do you think you can go to Gaza and be trans on the script? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=274.18s)]
*  You can be gender fluid. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  You can be beheaded. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  Does that transfer to Farsi? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=279.78000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  So you're not really a live fluid. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=282.53999999999996s)]
*  Right, absolutely. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=283.53999999999996s)]
*  But I would say this. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=284.53999999999996s)]
*  The one thing you have to make sure is that if they supply the burgers or not, or do you [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=285.53999999999996s)]
*  have to bring your own? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=290.05999999999995s)]
*  And are they for sale here at all? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=291.05999999999995s)]
*  Because that definitely will be limiting to some women and their women's rights activism, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  especially if you want to play in men's sports or vice versa. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=295.94s)]
*  So there's a lot going on today. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=299.52s)]
*  I did not know this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=301.26s)]
*  They say at this point, 24 states, 44 college campuses, and just 2,000 arrests. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=302.58s)]
*  What they weren't counting on is the counter protest. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=309.14s)]
*  What happened in UCLA when those Israeli or Jewish Americans, students or not, came in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=312.06s)]
*  and started saying, we're taking this in Campon Town ourselves. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=317.02s)]
*  We're seeing some of that chance go on at Rutgers. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=319.78s)]
*  They are not, they were not counting on in their format of being these radicals that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=322.2s)]
*  there'll be Americans who are going to be fed up with it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=327.82s)]
*  What is astounding is to see George Washington's face covered with that Palestinian garb and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=331.18s)]
*  flag. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=336.94s)]
*  We are the patriotic people in Washington. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=337.94s)]
*  DC police got surrounded when they went to take it down, so they left. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=342.14s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=346.02s)]
*  That's George Washington. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=347.02s)]
*  It looks like it's backfiring though, because the GOP, NRCC have already buying ads. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=348.02s)]
*  They're going to highlight all of this. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=355.22s)]
*  They're going to show what's happening on the campuses, and they're going to layer it [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=356.62s)]
*  with the squad members essentially standing with the pro-Hamas caucus. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=361.58s)]
*  So this is going to be on the ballot now, guys. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=367.02s)]
*  This is going to be on the ballot. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=370.26s)]
*  And the question is, will there be a pivot for Joe Biden as well as the Democrats? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=371.53999999999996s)]
*  That press conference that he gave yesterday, there was nothing new there. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=378.14s)]
*  I mean, oh yeah, I can then, I can then both sides has a right to protest. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=380.74s)]
*  I mean, we get that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=385.38s)]
*  That's a fundamental American principle, but there was no plan or action to stand with [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=386.58s)]
*  the Jewish people. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=391.97999999999996s)]
*  Or if they had this big roundtable that they were supposed to have two days ago, why didn't [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=393.58000000000004s)]
*  he say certain protections for the Jewish students? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=398.26s)]
*  And then when he was yelled at a question to him about should the National Guard be [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=401.82s)]
*  sent in, he said, no. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=405.74s)]
*  You got Jewish students being attacked that can't go into the classroom and you don't [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=407.74s)]
*  think we should send in the National Guard? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=410.78000000000003s)]
*  The National Guard, Lawrence, is to protect us from MAGA protesters. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=412.78000000000003s)]
*  We know that because that's what they did with the National Guard surrounding the Capitol. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=416.66s)]
*  They also put up metal detectors to make sure that there were no congressmen who were [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=420.22s)]
*  going to vote and they had to go through metal detectors to vote after January 6. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=426.54s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=430.70000000000005s)]
*  Here's what I think. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=431.70000000000005s)]
*  I think your question is such a good one, Lawrence. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=432.70000000000005s)]
*  Why you know, you see these images, the American people don't like it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=434.78000000000003s)]
*  They don't like seeing George Washington looking like a defaced or looking like a Hamas terrorist. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=438.02000000000004s)]
*  This doesn't look good. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=443.58000000000004s)]
*  So then why aren't they doing more to stop it? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=444.62s)]
*  Of course, is that there's conflict within their own party. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=447.74s)]
*  They're fighting. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=450.38s)]
*  You know, you have this, this, you know, these young people, there's a civil war in the middle [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=451.38s)]
*  of this and he doesn't want to get involved. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=455.09999999999997s)]
*  But I've often wondered as I've been watching this unfold, maybe they want us focusing on [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=456.97999999999996s)]
*  this protest because we're not paying attention as much because of these protests to what's [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=461.74s)]
*  coming across the border. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=466.26s)]
*  The border is still wide open. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=468.46s)]
*  The real terrorists are coming through. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=470.06s)]
*  The numbers of people that they want to come through to change our elections and our electorate [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=472.78s)]
*  are coming through. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=477.82s)]
*  So there's, there's that question as well in my mind. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=478.82s)]
*  Are we, are we? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=482.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=483.38s)]
*  I don't think that they could have scripted something as bad as the border. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=484.38s)]
*  This is just, this is almost as bad as the border collapse. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=486.9s)]
*  Remember, he was supposed to be the agent of normalcy. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=490.82s)]
*  He was supposed, the adults are back in charge. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=493.38s)]
*  Whether you look at Eastern Europe, whether you look at the Middle East or whether you [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=495.53999999999996s)]
*  college campuses, this guy has brought chaos. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=500.26s)]
*  And Alyssa Farah Griffin has become a Never Trump or used to work in the Trump camp, said, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=503.7s)]
*  look out everybody. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=508.3s)]
*  This thing is going more and more Donald Trump's direction. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=509.38s)]
*  And he wrote this in the Daily Beast. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=512.34s)]
*  Here's an excerpt. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=514.02s)]
*  And I didn't memorize it, so I'm going to need the prompter to go back to where it was. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=515.5s)]
*  It's been a good week for Donald Trump. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=518.9399999999999s)]
*  Trump spends his days gagged in courtroom, only appearing to give brief remarks to the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=521.02s)]
*  press. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=524.74s)]
*  Then consider Biden is deeply unpopular. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=525.74s)]
*  Most Americans don't believe the country is going in the right direction, actually [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=527.86s)]
*  only 26% do. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=530.38s)]
*  Then add in the terrible optics of violent campus protests over the war in Gaza. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=532.34s)]
*  It could be the perfect scenario to damage Biden from the far right and left and hand [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=536.42s)]
*  the race to Trump, despite the utter unfitness. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=540.94s)]
*  She does not think he'd be a great president. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=544.26s)]
*  Well, the American people, even without the campus chaos, had the former president in [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=546.82s)]
*  front. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=551.58s)]
*  It's an easy victory, God, because although the remarks from the former president are [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=552.58s)]
*  brief because he's headed into the courtroom or leaving to try to campaign, it addresses [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=557.7s)]
*  the moment. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=563.38s)]
*  It identifies who the enemy is. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=564.38s)]
*  He's talking about the crimes in city. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=566.82s)]
*  He's talking about the radicalization of our young people on the college campuses. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=568.62s)]
*  He's talking about the border. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=573.98s)]
*  So as they, this was a campaign tactic to keep him inside of the courtroom and not be [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=575.6600000000001s)]
*  able to campaign, but he's maximizing the time that he has. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=581.1400000000001s)]
*  And honestly, in comparison to Joe Biden, who has all the time in the world to campaign [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=585.46s)]
*  and talk to the American people, I mean, the bar is set so low. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=589.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, he takes every single question that is asked to him. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=594.0600000000001s)]
*  He talks off the cuff. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=597.0600000000001s)]
*  There's no notes. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=598.74s)]
*  There's no prompt. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=599.74s)]
*  There's no script. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=600.74s)]
*  Compare that to the guy that's in the White House where you have to beg him. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=601.74s)]
*  And then he's surrounded by all these press aides. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=604.62s)]
*  Can't walk. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=606.4200000000001s)]
*  I mean, good luck. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=607.4200000000001s)]
*  Trump is actively on trial for multiple felony charges and Biden's having worse news cycles. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=609.26s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=614.9s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=615.9s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_TOGojTB8&t=616.9s)]
