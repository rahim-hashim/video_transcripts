# This is even worse than you think: Shellenberger
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU)
*  Well this morning, Elon Musk's ex is banned in Brazil following a months long feud with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=0.0s)]
*  Musk who refuses to back down on free speech rights. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=6.32s)]
*  Our next guest warns the world is taking a giant leap towards totalitarianism. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=10.24s)]
*  Journalist Michael Schellenberger is here to explain. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=15.88s)]
*  Michael, I'm so glad to have you today on this topic. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=18.44s)]
*  So explain to us why this new form of totalitarianism, this censorship and sort of the complicity [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=21.56s)]
*  of the elites in this is more dangerous than the totalitarianism we've seen in the past. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=27.639999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, well, thanks so much for having me on. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I think people have to understand that if you can, if the government can control [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=35.8s)]
*  and the ruling party can control all of the information that we're allowed to see, then [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=40.0s)]
*  there's no need for tanks and torture chambers. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=45.4s)]
*  The U.S. government under Biden and Harris have been funding censorship advocacy in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=48.56s)]
*  Brazil. You know, the FBI went to Brazil to try to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=54.4s)]
*  share information on how to censor. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=57.56s)]
*  You know, we saw in the Twitter files, Brazil, the Brazilian government demanding that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=59.72s)]
*  not only X, but every other social media platform ban sitting members of the Brazilian [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  Senate ban independent journalists. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=72.48s)]
*  We now see in Brazil, the effective dictator of Brazil has frozen the bank accounts of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=75.84s)]
*  a different company, Starlink, which in which Elon Musk is also an investor. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=82.76s)]
*  So these are behaviors very similar to communist Cuba, other totalitarian regimes around [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=88.16s)]
*  the world. And our concern is given that they're coming very shortly after the arrest of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=94.52s)]
*  another social media CEO in France last week, it appears that we're in the midst of a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=100.36s)]
*  global totalitarian crackdown that we should all be very concerned could arrive here in [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=107.16s)]
*  the United States. Well, yeah, and if we're funding the censorship in these countries, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=112.28s)]
*  that's even more troubling. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=117.68s)]
*  I know Facebook has given in to the government demands. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=119.6s)]
*  And so he Facebook or Zuckerberg has. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=123.88s)]
*  So Facebook and Instagram remain there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=126.68s)]
*  But Elon Musk is the holdout. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=129.16s)]
*  So what does I mean, I'm seeing censorship and totalitarianism, this totalitarianism [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=131.64s)]
*  breaking out all over the Western Hemisphere. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=136.56s)]
*  What does what does this mean for America? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=138.84s)]
*  What can we expect, particularly if this administration, Kamala Harris, wins this coming [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=140.92s)]
*  election? She's part of the funding of the censorship in Brazil, for example. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's even worse than that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=153.56s)]
*  It's important for people to know that Kamala Harris repeatedly called for banning Donald [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=155.16s)]
*  Trump. Yes. Not just from not just from Twitter, but from every other social media platform. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=161.16s)]
*  Her running mate, Tim Walz, also said that there is no free speech guarantee for what [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=167.24s)]
*  he called misinformation, which is a completely subjective term. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=172.48s)]
*  Misinformation is what you call speech that you don't agree with or that you don't think [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=176.8s)]
*  is right. So here you have the Democratic presidential candidate and her running mate [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=181.32s)]
*  both strongly calling for censorship, not in foreign countries, but in the United States. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=185.96s)]
*  And by the way, you know, when the Brazilian government seeks to ban politicians, when [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=192.4s)]
*  Kamala Harris seeks to ban politicians from social media, that's election interference. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=197.12s)]
*  It's a violation of the First Amendment. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=203.28s)]
*  It's also an illegal interference in elections, which is absolutely prohibited under the US [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=205.48s)]
*  Constitution and really every country's constitution. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=211.04s)]
*  So I think that what we're seeing here is very serious in Americans. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=214.24s)]
*  Even if you don't care about Brazil, you should worry that totalitarianism and censorship [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=217.2s)]
*  could arrive in the United States in a really big way in years to come. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=222.28s)]
*  Oh, it's already here. Michael Schellenberger, it's just going to metastasize if the wrong [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  people are elected. No question about it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=232.28s)]
*  By the way, Zuckerberg, so weak and too greedy to stand up to the Brazilian government. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=234.68s)]
*  Maybe it's time for him to sell his platform to somebody with a lot more courage like Elon [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=241.32s)]
*  Musk, who's been able to stand up to to these thugs in the Brazilian government and also [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=244.96s)]
*  in our own. Michael Schellenberger, thanks so much for joining us and for breaking it [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=249.76s)]
*  down so succinctly and intelligently. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=253.84s)]
*  Thank you. Thanks for being. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=256.52s)]
*  Thanks for having me. You got it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajQL9onSSrU&t=258.4s)]
