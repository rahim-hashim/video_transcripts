# 'DIFFICULT SITUATION': Israeli father worries hostage son could need medical aid
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg)
*  A Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=0.0s)]
*  Desperate Israelis waiting to learn whether their loved ones being held hostage will be [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=4.2s)]
*  among the next round of releases expected today. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=8.4s)]
*  Including our next guest, whose 22-year-old son, Omer Venkert, suffers from a chronic [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=12.68s)]
*  stomach disease and is being held hostage after Hamas massacred the music festival last [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=19.16s)]
*  month. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Shai Venkert joins us now from Israel. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Shai, thank you for joining us under these, again, continuously horrific situations. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  But when you see the hostages being released so far and you await that word that your son [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=33.76s)]
*  could be part of that, how agonizing is waiting for that word? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=39.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=46.44s)]
*  I welcome all the release of the hostages that are running to their families. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=49.72s)]
*  This is a good day for us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=55.6s)]
*  We are probably, you saw all the release of the hostages. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  But my demand still is to release all hostages, take them all out. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=65.0s)]
*  And we demand that the current deal will be conditioned by ensuring the security and the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=71.48s)]
*  welfare of the remaining hostages. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=78.0s)]
*  My son has a colitis disease and he suffers a lot in this difficult situation, in this [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=81.54s)]
*  stress, the colitis is going to be severe and he needs medical aid. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=89.1s)]
*  There is a line in the agreement that the Red Cross needs to go inside to look out for [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=95.94s)]
*  the hostages, the remaining hostages. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=103.66s)]
*  So far they don't do anything. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=106.62s)]
*  The Prime Minister promised us that this is part of the deal. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=109.78s)]
*  So we're waiting for the Red Cross to go inside because it's a very difficult situation that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=115.5s)]
*  the captives that are still inside won't get their treatment as we ask and we demand it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=121.86s)]
*  Shay, so there were protests. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=130.62s)]
*  There have been a lot of protests in front of Benjamin Netanyahu's home on the Israeli [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=135.22s)]
*  side. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=140.42000000000002s)]
*  So what is the political situation? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  Where are the Israeli people in terms of getting all of the hostages out and the delays that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=143.9s)]
*  have been happening, the deals that are being made, and sort of making that a priority? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=149.70000000000002s)]
*  Because there's a lot of controversy because we've had generals on who say, well, getting [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=154.86s)]
*  the hostages and the ceasefire is allowing Hamas to regroup. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=158.18s)]
*  The families, of course, saying the hostages and their lives need to be the priority. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=166.06s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=171.78s)]
*  How is that being debated in Israel? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=173.26000000000002s)]
*  What is going on in Israel now? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=178.58s)]
*  They are getting some solutions, also political and also a military solution. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=180.06s)]
*  I'm not a political guy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  I'm not a military. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  I think they are doing the best. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=192.18s)]
*  They need to take all hostages out. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=194.82s)]
*  They assure us that this is the priority. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=197.22s)]
*  Take the hostages out. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  If we need to go inside again and to do the next step for the war, I think they should [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=203.34s)]
*  do it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=210.06s)]
*  This is my opinion, but I don't want any war. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=211.22s)]
*  We didn't start this war. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=214.58s)]
*  The Hamas ISIS started this war on us on 7th of October. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=216.01999999999998s)]
*  I believe in the government. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=220.73999999999998s)]
*  I know they are doing the best they can by negotiation, but other parties such as the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=222.26s)]
*  USA, such as Qatar, such as Egypt, and they are doing the best they can. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=227.89999999999998s)]
*  The negotiation will continue. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=233.94s)]
*  I believe this is the first step to take the hostages out. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=235.66s)]
*  They need to take care of all of them and to take them out. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=240.1s)]
*  Shai, I know that as a father, I have a 14-year-old son myself. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=245.9s)]
*  I can't put myself in your shoes because I haven't experienced that, but just know that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=250.1s)]
*  we are praying for your son's return as quick as possible. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=255.5s)]
*  I know it's probably difficult right now, but tomorrow is a new day. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=258.86s)]
*  We hope and pray that your son gets home safe. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=263.38s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=269.98s)]
*  Yes, we are very helpful. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=270.98s)]
*  We are full of faith. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=273.1s)]
*  The release is giving us more strength. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=275.86s)]
*  We are strong and we are waiting for my son. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=278.34000000000003s)]
*  Omer is a strong guy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=281.38s)]
*  He probably is in a difficult situation. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=283.62s)]
*  I can't imagine it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=286.74s)]
*  You can't imagine not to see your son for one day or if he's not on his TikTok or maybe [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=290.22s)]
*  he's not on his mobile. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=297.62s)]
*  This is 51 days. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=300.7s)]
*  I miss my son a lot. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=301.94s)]
*  I'm waiting for him. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=303.78000000000003s)]
*  He's a manager of a restaurant. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=306.3s)]
*  Usually he comes at night, so I'm waiting for him at night. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=310.26s)]
*  Now it's difficult. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=315.34s)]
*  All the nights are going longer and longer. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJcQ3_5enhg&t=317.09999999999997s)]
