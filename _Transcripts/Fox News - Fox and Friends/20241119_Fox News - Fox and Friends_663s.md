*  But has become a supporter [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=81.12s)]
*  Armstrong has already publicly endorsed a Trump appointed SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=82.56s)]
*  To lead that Commission the president-elect is still reviewing candidates for Treasury Secretary. It's a major economic position [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=87.24s)]
*  He's considering Kevin Warsh a former member of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors Apollo global management CEO Mark Rowan Howard Lutnick [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=94.4s)]

*  You know Musk has become a major figure in Trump's orbit [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=112.62s)]
*  He's endorsed Lutnick over Bessent and called Bessent a business as usual choice whereas Lutnick [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=115.22s)]
*  He says will actually enact change [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=121.34s)]
*  Musk has been hanging around Mar-a-Lago now [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=124.1s)]
*  It's president-elect Trump's turn to visit Elon Trump is reportedly traveling to a SpaceX launch in Brownsville, Texas [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=126.32s)]
*  That's where they're trying to launch those rockets and then recover them so they can reuse them part of SpaceX process there [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=133.5s)]
*  Reportedly the president-elect's gonna go check out a launch later today back to you. All right, Rich. Thank you very much [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=139.74s)]
*  They should do a buddy movie together [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=145.38s)]
*  We're watching it. Well when Trump was on the couch a couple of weeks before the election [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=148.34s)]
*  He was raving about and then you saw how SpaceX was able to catch that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=154.34s)]
*  That rocket with the so-called chopsticks and he was raving about it. So today the current [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=159.5s)]
*  future former president [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=166.14s)]
*  Will be there 5 o'clock in Texas. Can you can someone help me for a second? Who's this Sean Duffy guy? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=168.45999999999998s)]
*  I mean, can you believe this? I mean, it's gonna be great. No doubt about it [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=181.82s)]
*  I mean, he probably would have been governor if he wanted to stay in Wisconsin and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=185.67999999999998s)]
*  Now he comes here doing a fantastic job as an anchor and Rachel was here yesterday [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=190.06s)]
*  Myself what did I just ask by the way is your husband gonna be joining the administration but no, I'm too absorbed [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=198.5s)]
*  Every guess we have are you being tapped is your spouse being? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  She couldn't have said anything because [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=212.94s)]
*  Ultimately, you don't want to get in front of the president and he put that out [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=215.22s)]
*  I think right about six o'clock last night so whispered it. So despite what Politico put in one of their headlines [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=218.22s)]
*  He's not just a former reality star. He actually has a background [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=223.54s)]
*  He served nine years as a US congressman where he was on the financial services committee and chair of the subcommittee on [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=227.34s)]
*  Insurance and housing. He's a former district attorney in Ashland County, Wisconsin [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=233.9s)]
*  He graduated from st. Mary's with a JD in law. So he has an extensive resume [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=238.02s)]
*  He does indeed and he's a wonderful guy a great guy, you know who didn't want him [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=244.14000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk apparently Elon Musk and a number of other [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=250.06s)]
*  Top Silicon Valley people were pushing for another guy this tech exec by the name of Emil Michael [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=253.7s)]
*  They were pushing for him. Emil Michael put out a lovely tweet [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=260.54s)]
*  After Sean was tapped and said Sean's gonna do a great job [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=264.94s)]
*  But it just goes to show you there's a lot of jockeying behind the scenes to try to get everybody's person on board [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=268.54s)]
*  Apparently Elon Musk continues to push Howard Lutnick for Treasury, but that seems to be going nowhere right now [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=275.86s)]
*  Well, he is married to Rachel our weekend co-host on Fox and Friends and they have nine children together. So he's definitely equipped [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=282.58s)]
*  He's great [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=290.46s)]
*  Charming wonderful great presenter. But the only thing is it is sacrifice [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=292.06s)]
*  I mean he just moved to New Jersey and I mean when you talk about service to the country, that's what he's doing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=296.06s)]
*  Nine kids. I don't know how him back and forth Rachel's doing two shows now in two languages [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=306.73999999999995s)]
*  And now he's gonna go to Washington. This is truly service [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=307.97999999999996s)]
*  One other thing about Treasury Secretary [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  Scott Besson did come up with George Soros, but when he saw what sources going off the reservation he left [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=313.86s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=319.18s)]
*  so he knows exactly the mindset of some of the most insidious planning of the extreme left because he's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=319.66s)]
*  Financing it and I thought he would be a huge asset for that because he was able to spot that early [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=326.58s)]
*  Ryan is talking about some of the internal fight [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=332.3s)]
*  You may have seen some of the report the reporting when it comes to trick Treasury Secretary [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=334.22s)]
*  A lot of people gunning for the job and it looks like the the president-elect is still yet to make a decision on that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=338.42s)]
*  One thing I do know is the people that make it obvious that they want a position have been the people less likely [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=345.02000000000004s)]
*  Oh really the and that's Howard Lutnick, correct? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=351.46000000000004s)]
*  And in fact push for it if they campaign for it, especially when they push for it publicly right that are more reserved [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=354.5s)]
*  And don't say anything the one thing I appreciate [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=361.14s)]
*  Caroline Levin she was qualified for the job. Everybody wanted her to get the job. Everyone was singing her [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=363.62s)]
*  she never once said that she wanted the job and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=368.90000000000003s)]
*  The president-elect took that in mind right and that goes for the rest of them as well [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=371.5s)]
*  So he the president is going to sit down with the two other Treasury nominees tomorrow and try to figure out [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=375.02000000000004s)]
*  So maybe by Thursday will know meanwhile the President Trump is vowing a national emergency [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=382.82000000000005s)]
*  He's gonna use military the military for mass deportations and crackdown [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=388.62s)]
*  He says beginning on day one because he says on when he's inaugurated he wants to close our borders [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  He said that throughout the entire election the majority of the voters agreed with him and they want to do something about immigration [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  But some of these Democratic leaders it's leaving them in disarray Brian. Yeah [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=403.68s)]
*  Yeah, here's a couple things going on here. Number one. You got to put the wall at the same time [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=408.0s)]
*  Yes, number two is you have to understand these governors in these mayors and these you know [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=411.48s)]
*  These people the governor of Arizona a border state should be ashamed of herself JB Pritzker [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=417.21999999999997s)]
*  You see what's happening in Chicago and you're still pushing back Jared Polis my goodness [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=422.14s)]
*  You have given up Denver that said cities in the toilet Aurora is about to go out out [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=427.58s)]
*  Out the same direction and you're still not sticking up for the people that elected you Maura Healy in [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  Massachusetts who feels more comfortable taking aim at a congressman in her own state a left-winger [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=438.94s)]
*  A Democrat and then Brandon Johnson one of the biggest embarrassments in this country a just a [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=444.22s)]
*  Radical who just got that job because there's nobody else out there and Michelle you what do they have in common? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=451.42s)]
*  They all believe it's the up to them to fight for illegals living amongst them [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=457.34000000000003s)]
*  Does he do they understand that it's criminals they're going for? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  They're not gonna go in there and go into the local kitchens [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=467.54s)]
*  At the local cheers and pull out people that are there there are handling the or the fry cooks [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=471.38s)]
*  They're going for the criminals [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=478.74s)]
*  So you think it's more important to protect the criminals because you're in that 19 or maybe the 2000 mindset of [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=480.29999999999995s)]
*  illegals [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=488.29999999999995s)]
*  Illegals matter. Yeah, they're people but they broke the law [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=489.46s)]
*  one of the main reasons why Donald Trump is president is because of this and I wish somebody would just put politics aside and [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=493.58s)]
*  Look at the well for their people and it might just be the mayor of New York City [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=500.5s)]
*  Who met with the president on Saturday briefly has talked to him before and he understands how what they're doing to this city [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=504.22s)]
*  Well ultimately and when Tom Homan was with us just last week when he had just been named [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=511.7s)]
*  The plan is and it's been detailed apparently they're gonna get rid of the that little app they've got right now [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=518.58s)]
*  They're gonna get rid of that. They're gonna stop doing that. They're gonna use [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=524.7s)]
*  Remain in Mexico, but here's the key [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=527.82s)]
*  They are going to prioritize people with criminal convictions and final removal orders last year [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=530.46s)]
*  There were over a million of those [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=536.6s)]
*  Ordered to leave and it could take years just to remove [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=539.1s)]
*  That million people who have been told to leave and so that's one of the problems also the other problem for the current [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=544.1s)]
*  Future president is the fact that with the Department of Border Patrol [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=551.84s)]
*  They currently have seven thousand ICE officers. They deport [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=557.84s)]
*  250,000 a year Trump has said he wants to quadruple that number [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=561.76s)]
*  So they're going to have to recruit a lot more and the training academies are not equipped for that number [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=565.48s)]
*  So something's got to get [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnqowexRZI&t=571.76s)]
