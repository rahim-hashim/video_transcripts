# ICE refutes Dodgers' claim that agents tried to raid stadium before game: 'FALSE'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds)
*  Yeah, and thank you so much, Shanley. As those protests continue, the Dodgers Stadium, Dodgers MLB, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=0.0s)]
*  they're saying that dozens of federal agents were seen near Dodgers Stadium yesterday, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=6.3s)]
*  and they denied them entry into the ballpark. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=11.64s)]
*  But ICE says we weren't there. What are you talking about? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=14.14s)]
*  We weren't looking to go there, and we weren't there. But that didn't stop the Dodgers, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=17.38s)]
*  by the way, they posted things saying it was false. We can go back and forth if you want. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=21.78s)]
*  This morning, ICE agents came to Dodgers Stadium and requested permission to access lots. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=26.38s)]
*  They were denied entry into the grounds by the organization. Tonight's game will be played as scheduled. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=31.18s)]
*  Now, the ICE came back and said, false. We were never there. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=35.98s)]
*  Homeland came back and said this had nothing to do with the Dodgers. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=39.18s)]
*  CBP vehicles were in the stadium parking lot very briefly, unrelated to any operations or any enforcement. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=43.18s)]
*  It reminds me of this. If you ever see police, they will get together in parking lots and confer [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=50.08s)]
*  about what threats or what type of things. That's probably what it was. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=54.98s)]
*  You've got this huge parking lot in the middle of nowhere. It's called Dodgers Stadium. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=59.379999999999995s)]
*  You're exactly right, Brian. Look, ICE and other law enforcement teams have to find areas to stage, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=62.779999999999994s)]
*  They're staging. They're doing whatever. They're trying to move it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=69.58s)]
*  So basically DHS is saying, look, they were just in the parking lot, had nothing to do with it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=71.88s)]
*  But yet it triggered the protesters' fever pitch out there in LA. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=75.78s)]
*  They go and rush to the Dodgers parking lot and start protesting. Listen to what some of them said. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=80.98s)]
*  Well, the reason they're saying that the Dodgers organization faced a lot of criticism from the protesters [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=96.38000000000001s)]
*  because the protesters wanted the Dodgers, the Major League Baseball team, to speak out against the ICE raids. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=100.68s)]
*  And CA Rising, which is one of these organizations that's protesting, a representative said, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=106.98s)]
*  the largest economic engine in this area is silent. Wake up, do better. We know you can. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=112.78s)]
*  But they're a sporting team. I don't know why anyone would expect them to get involved in this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=117.58s)]
*  You should not. You know, the MLS tends to be way left. I saw an Austin FC. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=121.78s)]
*  They were holding up signs and we saw the women's soccer team out in Los Angeles [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=126.78s)]
*  say with the U.S. immigrants and played with New Jersey's on. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=131.58s)]
*  You know, I guess they were afraid their goalie was going to be deported. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=135.38s)]
*  So now you have a situation where they're asking the Dodgers, a huge Hispanic area with Dodger Stadiums located, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  you know, Spanish presence, Hispanic presence there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=144.98s)]
*  But if you notice those days of saying the Hispanic community is against illegal immigration are over, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=148.18s)]
*  they don't want criminals in their midst anyway. And looking at crackdown on illegals, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  making that synonymous with crackdowns on Hispanics, I think we have sobered up to that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=160.18s)]
*  That was back in 2010 when the when the conversation was new. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=166.18s)]
*  But the problem, Brian, and the reason why there's this 500 percent increase on threats against ICE is you have politicians [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  from Tim Walz to Hakeem Jeffries, a minority leader calling ICE agents, Gestapo likening them to Nazis. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=175.38s)]
*  The mask. So it's all at the end of the day, just an attack on Trump. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=182.78s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade and I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqlp_cPxsds&t=187.58s)]
