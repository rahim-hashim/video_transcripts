# Expert makes bombshell claim about Iran’s proxies: They are ‘rocking on their heels’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E)
*  A defiant Hamas declares it will not release its remaining hostages after Israeli forces [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=0.0s)]
*  killed October 7th Mastermind Yaya Sinwar. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=6.96s)]
*  We're learning the Hamas chief hid in the same tunnel where the Israeli-American hostages [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=10.76s)]
*  were murdered before being killed himself in Ra'afah. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  But remember when Vice President Harris warned against invading that city. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=19.16s)]
*  Any major military operation in Ra'afah would be a huge mistake. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=24.68s)]
*  Let me tell you something, I have studied the maps. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=31.2s)]
*  There's nowhere for those folks to go. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=34.88s)]
*  We've been very clear that it would be a mistake to move into Ra'afah with any type of military [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=36.56s)]
*  operation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=42.92s)]
*  Chief editor of the Middle East Forum, Jim Hanson joins us now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=48.92s)]
*  Jim, very serious question. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  I know you're not part of the Harris campaign, but I have to ask this question. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=52.48s)]
*  What maps is she talking about? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=56.08s)]
*  I think she's probably talking about a map that one of her abused staffers showed her [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  while she was pretending to pay attention. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=64.12s)]
*  She is far from a military mastermind as her comments on Afghanistan have shown us. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=67.46s)]
*  Israel has been deadly in stacking terrorists like Cordwood over the past few months. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  Right now what they need is US support to let them finish off the evil empires on their [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=80.56s)]
*  borders. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=86.08s)]
*  Explain to viewers why it is so important that Sinwar was killed, where he was killed [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=89.08s)]
*  and how wrong, grievously wrong that military advice that Kamala Harris was giving was in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=94.68s)]
*  terms of being in Ra'afah and where he was found. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=102.04s)]
*  You conducted a very measured campaign to go into a succession of neighborhoods in Gaza, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=107.64s)]
*  wiping out the Hamas fighters in them and pushing the rest of them out into the next [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=115.2s)]
*  neighborhood. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=120.32s)]
*  Hamas kept moving and hiding amongst a new group of civilians. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=121.32s)]
*  And one of the last holdouts they had was in Ra'afah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=125.32s)]
*  And when they got there, instead of saying, OK, let's go in and finish the job, the Biden-Harris [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=128.36s)]
*  was telling them, why don't you guys give them a ceasefire and let them regroup, rearm [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=134.84s)]
*  and continue on? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=139.84s)]
*  If they had followed that advice, that Hamas leader would still be alive and Hamas would [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  be in a better condition to continue their 75-year campaign to try and push the Jews [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=146.16s)]
*  into the sea. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=151.96s)]
*  So we've lost another key figure in Hamas. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=153.56s)]
*  We've seen both Hezbollah and Hamas leaders get picked off, as you point out, kind of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=157.68s)]
*  stacked like cordwood here. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=163.8s)]
*  Where do they keep going to find new leadership? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=166.56s)]
*  Well, they're going to run very short on it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=169.88s)]
*  Terrorist groups, I hate when people use the term terrorist mastermind. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=174.60000000000002s)]
*  You don't have to be a mastermind to slaughter innocent civilians. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=178.3s)]
*  What you have to be is a reprehensible evil person and part of an evil organization. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=181.8s)]
*  They will continue to move down the food chain to lesser quality people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=187.44s)]
*  But I think the important thing is right now, Iran's entire collection of proxy groups is [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=192.58s)]
*  rocking on its heels. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=198.74s)]
*  And we're about to see Israel's retaliation for the recent attacks on them by Iran directly. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=200.82s)]
*  I think that was part of the deal that Bibi made with Biden to get the high-altitude theater [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=207.76s)]
*  air defense in was that he wouldn't hit the nuke sites, but he's going to pound them hard [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  and they want to be prepared. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=217.72s)]
*  It's time to hit the spider at the center of the web and maybe time to say it's the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=219.38s)]
*  Islamic Republic of Iran should probably not be leading that country anymore. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=224.72s)]
*  Really appreciate your insights this morning. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=230.83999999999997s)]
*  Jim Hanson, thank you so much. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=233.28s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=235.83999999999997s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=236.83999999999997s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEzqe2BuR4E&t=237.83999999999997s)]
