# Hosts break down in laughter over KJP's farewell message
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw)
*  So we know that there'll be a very new team in place at the White House very soon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=0.0s)]
*  A member of the outgoing team is Corrine Jean-Pierre, the press secretary for President Biden. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=4.96s)]
*  She posted this on social media. Charlie's beside himself already. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=10.64s)]
*  Here's to the best team in the business. I couldn't do it without you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=14.8s)]
*  Sort of wonder how she would be without them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=18.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=20.32s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=20.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=21.28s)]
*  This is like... [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=21.76s)]
*  No she didn't. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  And look, in fairness, when you're doing a tough job and she has one [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=22.8s)]
*  and you have that camaraderie, you want to pay tribute to people that you work with, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=27.68s)]
*  but this sort of has the same vibe to me as like someone on the Chicago White Sox from this past [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=31.92s)]
*  season putting out a team photo and being like, what an amazing group to be a part of. They lost [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=37.28s)]
*  121 games in Chicago this past season. That's the baseball equivalent of this press shop. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=42.24s)]
*  I understand that President Biden didn't give them much to work with, right? It's very hard [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=48.72s)]
*  to speak on his behalf and defend him, but with all respect, she is uniquely bad at this job. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=52.96s)]
*  And she has the entire press corps almost exclusively behind her. They're doing her [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=60.56s)]
*  work for her and she still is a complete disaster. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=66.72s)]
*  That's right. I thought Molly Hemingway, the great Molly Hemingway, had one of the best [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=70.08s)]
*  tweets out there on this. She said, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  y'all still failed. So let's look at, let's get a little bit of a look back at some of the highlights [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=82.96s)]
*  of what some people who some people call binder, Kareen Jean-Pierre. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  Title 42 is going to be lifted. Yes, it will. But there we are going to move to Title 8. The border [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  is not open. Is there any possibility that the president would end up pardoning his son? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  No. I just said no. I just answered. Go ahead. Instead of Republicans, you know, focusing on the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=109.12s)]
*  president's performance in office and what he's been able to accomplish his actual record, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=116.0s)]
*  they do these cheap fakes. Is there a real alarm happening behind the scenes that the president [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=121.84s)]
*  is simply too old to stake around for the four years? No, there's no alarm happening behind the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=126.72s)]
*  scenes. I would put the president's stamina, president's wisdom, ability to get this done [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=130.8s)]
*  on behalf of the American people against anyone. Well, she did say at one point as well that she [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=137.36s)]
*  and some of the staffers just could scarcely keep up with Joe Biden and his pace and his energy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=148.0s)]
*  And it's just like, I think laughing, unfortunately, is the right response, right? It's a joke. It was [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=154.16000000000003s)]
*  gaslighting at the time. Cheap fakes. One of the creepiest things that's happened in our politics [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  in the last year was Corrine Jean-Pierre spewing out that word cheap fakes, which no one had ever [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=164.0s)]
*  heard before. And then most of the mainstream media picking it up overnight, like through [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=170.16s)]
*  osmosis within hours. They're like, oh, this is a thing that we say now. And of course, it wasn't [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=174.96s)]
*  cheap. It wasn't fake. It was real. And the lie that she told to our colleague, Mark Meredith, about [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=179.84s)]
*  the pardon, for example, it's just like one greatest hit after another from this crew, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=186.72s)]
*  starring in many cases her because he, the principal, rarely spoke. And sadly, it proves [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=191.92s)]
*  you can tell any lie. And it doesn't matter how big it is. If you just tell it and keep telling it [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=197.76s)]
*  and keep telling it, there's a portion of the people that believe it and they fall in line. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=203.2s)]
*  And then we wind up, you know, months, years later, oh, it turns out all the speculation about [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  his mental incapacity. All it took was an op-ed from George Clooney and then they all switched [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=216.32s)]
*  over. It's crazy. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-8Rj2XIKw&t=222.72s)]
