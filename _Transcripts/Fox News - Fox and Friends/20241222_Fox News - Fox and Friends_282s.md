# Jason Rantz: Dems are ‘silly and lazy’ in verbal attacks on Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag)
*  And to allow a billionaire whose wealth, quite frankly, I believe has doubled since the election, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=0.0s)]
*  to run our government really has grave consequences. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=8.24s)]
*  It's not Donald Trump asking for this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  It's very clearly President Elon Musk asking for this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=14.9s)]
*  We negotiated. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  Mike Johnson agreed to it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  And because, as you said, Elon Musk, a billionaire, tweeted about it, President Musk tweeted about [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=28.66s)]
*  Democrats hitting President-elect Trump with petty jabs, suggesting Elon Musk is the one [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=31.02s)]
*  calling the shots. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=35.32s)]
*  But our next guest says this is just a lazy strategy to try and get under Trump's skin [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=36.94s)]
*  and it won't work. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=42.1s)]
*  Seattle radio host Jason Rantz joins us now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=43.26s)]
*  Jason, listen, this is clearly an attempt to get under Trump's skin. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=46.3s)]
*  But you know, calling Elon Musk, President Musk, a bit far, even though in fairness, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=51.82s)]
*  was the first to tweet about the problems with the original continuing resolution bill. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=57.5s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=62.94s)]
*  But for all we know, he was tweeting because Donald Trump was the one who was upset about [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=64.94s)]
*  the direction that the bill was going. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=69.74s)]
*  I think it's very clear that they're running off of the same script. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=71.86s)]
*  If it's not saying President Trump or President Elon Musk, it's the shadow president. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=75.5s)]
*  It's all these talking points that clearly have been distributed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  And if it wasn't so obvious, perhaps it would work. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=83.5s)]
*  If this was organic, if the American people were all of a sudden truly questioning whether [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=86.86s)]
*  or not Donald Trump is in charge or Elon Musk, it might cause some little bit of a rift. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=91.9s)]
*  But because it is so obvious what it is they're doing, I have to imagine Donald Trump looks [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=97.5s)]
*  at this and he kind of laughs because at the end of the day, so long as he's getting his [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=102.44000000000001s)]
*  agenda to move forward when he's not even president yet, I think he considers it a win. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=106.04s)]
*  And you know, we heard from Caroline Leavitt, the incoming White House first secretary, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=111.7s)]
*  saying that, look, President Trump is in charge full stop. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=116.34s)]
*  But you know, you also have heard a few even Republicans have suggested, well, wait a minute, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=120.46s)]
*  maybe we should make Elon Musk speaker of the House replacing Mike Johnson. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=126.42s)]
*  What do you make of those suggestions? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=131.38s)]
*  I think that is a bad idea. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=135.22s)]
*  It is a handful of people who are pursuing this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=136.62s)]
*  I think clearly whether it's Mike Johnson or someone else who's currently a House member, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  that's the smartest move. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=143.82s)]
*  I don't think you can just put someone into that position who doesn't understand the position [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=144.9s)]
*  and has never really worked within that kind of infrastructure politically. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=148.66s)]
*  I think it's incredibly difficult for anyone. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=153.38s)]
*  You've got to wrangle together a whole bunch of folks who, from a principal standpoint, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=156.42s)]
*  maybe all stand on the same side, but they don't always want the exact same thing. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=161.1s)]
*  And so I don't think Elon Musk can easily step into a role like that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=165.16s)]
*  Justin, do you think that the Democrats fail to see or admit that, hey, for a moment, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=169.62s)]
*  it might be good to have this individual, not just any billionaire, but a man who revolutionized [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  the auto industry by moving to a more energy efficient with Tesla and cars, a man that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=183.82s)]
*  rescued astronauts stranded in space because of his SpaceX private company that will now [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=189.62s)]
*  bring Sunny and the other astronaut back from being stranded, the man that owns the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=196.22s)]
*  largest information pipeline on the internet right now in owning X, do you think maybe [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=203.22s)]
*  we should be looking at that and say maybe that's good advice and a good person to get [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=209.5s)]
*  some counsel from for the commander in chief? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=214.78s)]
*  Well, when have progressives ever done the smart thing, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=217.98s)]
*  This was a guy who used to be the sweetheart, the darling of the Democratic Party because [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=222.02s)]
*  of Tesla. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=228.06s)]
*  And now all of a sudden, you've got liberals who are saying they're ashamed to even own [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=229.06s)]
*  one and might want to resell it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=232.78s)]
*  I think at the end of the day, this is just part of their, again, silly and lazy attacks [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=234.94s)]
*  on billionaires, despite the fact that, hey, you just had a candidate who raised a billion [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=240.54000000000002s)]
*  dollars and failed. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=246.06s)]
*  You had a whole bunch of Democrats who are raising a whole bunch of money from millionaires [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=247.06s)]
*  and billionaires. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=250.22s)]
*  And raising investment in the U.S. because the economic center of the universe seems [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=251.26s)]
*  to be running through Mar-a-Lago, not Wall Street or Silicon Valley, based on the number [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=257.5s)]
*  of CEOs that are coming there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=260.74s)]
*  And as the Wall Street Journal says, kissing the ring, bending the knee and cutting the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=262.78s)]
*  chick. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=266.26s)]
*  Jason Rantz, thank you for taking time and have a Merry Christmas. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=267.26s)]
*  Merry Christmas. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=269.62s)]
*  Merry Christmas. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZnL7yOwzag&t=281.22s)]
