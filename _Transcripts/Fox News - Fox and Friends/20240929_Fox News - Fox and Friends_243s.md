**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc)
*  It's just about in just about one hour uniformed officers are set to kick off the 23rd annual tunnel of towers 5k run and walk event in Brooklyn [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's check in with Abby one a sec live in Brooklyn for the event [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=9.32s)]
*  We've joined by tunnels to towers founder our friend Frank Siller and son of fallen FDNY [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Firefighter Stephen Siller [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=19.28s)]
*  Frank is is the mayor over here Frank. You are absolutely crushing it. This event has been incredible [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=21.52s)]
*  For 23 years talk to me about the moment it started all the way up until now [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=27.12s)]
*  The moment it started is when my family we realized that we wanted to do something special and honor my brother [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  Stephen who paid the ultimate sacrifice on 9-eleven and a friend of his Billy cod said to me one day [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  Hey Frank, why don't we have a run and I said Billy, you know, like I wanted something really special [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=44.56s)]
*  He goes no [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=50.0s)]
*  Why don't we just do what Stephen did and run through the tunnel to the towers? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=50.64s)]
*  And when he said that I was overcome with emotion and now we've been doing it 23 years [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=55.08s)]
*  But a thousand people the first year now we have over 40,000 here with us this year over 40,000 [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=60.28s)]
*  It's because people are obviously honoring your brother your father as well. Can you talk to me about his legacy? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=65.2s)]
*  Honestly, it's a beautiful thing [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=71.64s)]
*  I feel his presence in my life every day because of him were able to help so many people and I'm so grateful for what? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=73.28s)]
*  We were able to make out of his loss. I think every single one of us is truly blessed [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=79.72s)]
*  This this run I did it a few years ago when you come out of that tunnel you're overcome with emotion [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=85.64s)]
*  Do you have a favorite part of this day? Well, I would say that this this event [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=90.72s)]
*  Covers everything a covers honoring it covers remembering and then we celebrate the lives of these great heroes [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=96.36s)]
*  They paid the ultimate sacrifice for us and not just on 9-eleven [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=103.78s)]
*  think of the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=107.4s)]
*  7,000 men and women that gave their lives for us in the global war on terror and think of every police officer [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=108.0s)]
*  Firefighter first responder that died almost every single day here in America and we made a promise [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=113.56s)]
*  That we are going to take care of every single one of them and the families that are left behind forever [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  And our homeless veterans. I cannot forget that we are doing that homeless veterans [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  6,500 of them off the street this year and we promise we're gonna eradicate homeless veterans [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=129.24s)]
*  You see our first responders coming in now with the flag and we're ready to get going [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=133.6s)]
*  Can you just lay out how this day works they've got the first wave the second wave who are we seeing running in this race? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  well, the first wave was our [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=145.16s)]
*  Catastrophic collegiate service members our Gold Star families and our fallen first responders families and their kids. That's the first wave [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=147.92s)]
*  There was maybe three thousand of them that took off now at 930 [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=155.38s)]
*  The official start happens for everybody else that came to honor [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=159.62s)]
*  Everybody's lives and we have waves about six to eight thousand in each wave. We have about ten waves [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=164.32s)]
*  So we have over 40,000 people that are coming. I'm gonna close my math was off a little bit there six eight thousand times [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=172.24s)]
*  Then it's a little bit wrong, but you know [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=178.08s)]
*  And Stephen do you have a message for anyone else's family who has a mom or dad putting on that uniform? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, honestly, I think the foundation in this day is not a day about all the lives that were lost [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  But it's a day about remembering the sacrifices first responders and military service members go through on a daily basis [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=191.44s)]
*  It's not just guys that lose their lives [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=197.4s)]
*  They face difficult situations every day and this is a show of support for the men and women that face those situations [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=199.24s)]
*  You guys are some of the most incredible people I have ever met and it's a blessing just to be so it's Fox [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=206.12s)]
*  You didn't tell me to say that I'm telling you now we could not help the people that we help without the Fox viewers [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=213.8s)]
*  T2t.org $11 a month you can save lives. Will you toss it back to Pete and Rachel? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=219.82000000000002s)]
*  All Pete hey Pete. I checked you didn't sign up yet Pete. I gotta tell you [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=225.9s)]
*  I'll do that right now right now Frank. I think my wife already signed up for you didn't check her Frank [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BKWX2tazdc&t=235.06s)]
