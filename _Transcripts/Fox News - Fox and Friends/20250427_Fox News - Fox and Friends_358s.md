# Pope Francis praised for ‘conclave of surprises to come'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg)
*  We're reflecting all morning on the passing of Pope Francis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=0.0s)]
*  We're also talking about his legacy as the leader of the Catholic Church, and now begins [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=7.32s)]
*  the centuries-old tradition of electing a new pope. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Our own Bill Hemmer explains the conclave process. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=19.92s)]
*  The Vatican summons cardinals for the papal conclave. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=20.92s)]
*  Only those under the age of 80 can vote. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=26.08s)]
*  They're known as cardinal electors. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=28.72s)]
*  They take an oath swearing to never reveal what happens at the conclave, and they vote [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  by secret ballot. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=36.44s)]
*  Cardinals write their choice for supreme pontiff, as it's called. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=38.8s)]
*  One by one, they bring up their votes to Michelangelo's fresco of last judgment and place the ballots [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=43.099999999999994s)]
*  in a chalice. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=48.36s)]
*  The cardinals will vote four times each day until one candidate receives two-thirds of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=50.04s)]
*  the votes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=55.64s)]
*  After each vote, if nobody receives enough support, the ballots go into a stove with [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=57.56s)]
*  chemicals to make black smoke. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=62.48s)]
*  When one candidate receives enough votes, the final ballots are burned with a chemical [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=65.7s)]
*  that turns the smoke white. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=70.8s)]
*  is Fox News contributor and Catholic journalist Raymond Arroyo. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=76.28s)]
*  Raymond, Peggy Noonan had an article, an op-ed, come out on Pope Francis. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=81.52s)]
*  She called it a dry-eyed mourning, which I think is descriptive and accurate. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=86.04s)]
*  For those who don't understand what that means and why a Catholic like Peggy would say that, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=92.88s)]
*  explain. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=99.16s)]
*  Well, I think, look, Catholics, our hearts always break when you lose a pope. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=100.16s)]
*  He's the father of the faith. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=105.2s)]
*  But in the case of Pope Francis, though we love the external visage of him going out [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=106.92s)]
*  to the peripheries, going out to people who perhaps felt estranged from the church, at [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=111.76s)]
*  the same time, inside the faith, he could be pretty tough. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  He didn't like rigor. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=121.0s)]
*  He didn't like the devotions and the traditions of the church. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=122.36s)]
*  Threw a lot of those off, as you saw with the way he lived, the clothes he wore, the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  places he went. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  Even in the funeral? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, even in the funeral. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  This is a pared-down funeral. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  It was a very spare funeral and a kind of do-it-yourself, which is how he ran the papacy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=133.48s)]
*  Inside the church, though he's loved, there is also a sadness at what happened in the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=138.84s)]
*  chaos and the lack of clarity that's in the church, which is why you see so many cardinals [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  now. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=149.32s)]
*  Cardinal Dolan, Cardinal Mueller from Germany, all saying, almost not coordinated, we need [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=150.32s)]
*  someone who will reinforce the tradition. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=156.0s)]
*  We need a pope who will restate what the gospel demands of us and take it in a vibrant way [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=159.4s)]
*  to the world. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=163.96s)]
*  That's what's needed now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=165.28s)]
*  And I think that's right. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=166.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we definitely felt it here in the American Catholic Church. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=167.6s)]
*  It's interesting to see how was his legacy across the globe and what is the expectation [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=171.28s)]
*  moving forward into the conclave? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  How does the legacy of Pope Francis, how is that going to reflect on who the next one [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=180.36s)]
*  is? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=185.32s)]
*  Because you see so much vibrancy from the African church, which is much more traditional, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=186.32s)]
*  much more conservative. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=191.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=192.12s)]
*  Well, look, the church is going to be looking for where are those vibrant hotspots? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=193.12s)]
*  It's Africa, it's Asia, India. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=197.52s)]
*  That's where things are heating up. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=201.12s)]
*  However, in the West, we had thousands and thousands of converts here in the United States, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=202.12s)]
*  1,700 converts in France. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  So Europe is opening up, and it's mostly young people, and they're looking for orthodoxy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=210.96s)]
*  They're looking for a sure faith they can stand upon to guide their life. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  And in many areas of the church today, Pope Francis had this synodal approach where he [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=220.16s)]
*  said, let's throw these issues into the middle of the table. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=227.24s)]
*  Let's have a conversation about it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  And he invited everybody in to have that conversation, not the cardinals and bishops. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=231.8s)]
*  That caused a lot of confusion. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=236.36s)]
*  The blessing of gay unions in Africa, they went crazy over that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=238.24s)]
*  Allowing divorced and remarried Catholics to come to communion without being annulled, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=243.36s)]
*  that also caused huge controversy. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=247.4s)]
*  Those controversies need to be settled, and we need a clear path, and there's nothing [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=250.12s)]
*  wrong with devotion. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=254.88s)]
*  It was interesting. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=256.04s)]
*  He allowed for outside voices. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=257.04s)]
*  He wanted to bring more people into the faith, and yet he banned the Latin Mass, which hurt [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=259.36s)]
*  cradle Catholics, people who were attracted to Catholicism because of those rituals and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=266.28s)]
*  traditions and the beautiful liturgy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=271.35999999999996s)]
*  You know, there's an old saying, after a fat pope comes a thin pope. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=273.28s)]
*  And what that means is you can do whatever you want in your papacy, but there's something [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=277.76s)]
*  after you, and you no doubt will affect the next pope. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  And my guess is the next pope will cure that ban on the Latin Mass. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  Even with how many liberal cardinals have been put into place by Pope Francis? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=289.88s)]
*  You're presuming they're liberal because he did appoint 108 of the 133 electors. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=297.76s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=302.8s)]
*  However, he did it in the same messy, haphazard way that he conducted other parts of the papacy [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=303.8s)]
*  and the reform of the Vatican bureaucracy. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=308.84s)]
*  It was not with precision. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=311.12s)]
*  He doesn't really know these men. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=312.48s)]
*  Yes, they came from far-flung parts of the world, but they don't necessarily ideologically [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=313.92s)]
*  agree with him. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=319.42s)]
*  They're not carbon copies. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=320.62s)]
*  I think he called himself—he often referred to the god of surprises. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=322.18s)]
*  Pope Francis may have created a papacy of surprises and a conclave of surprises to come. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=326.62s)]
*  Well, we're looking forward to that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=332.9s)]
*  We're looking forward to more of your thoughts and insight as we cover the conclave, which [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=334.5s)]
*  we will do here at Fox News. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=339.34s)]
*  I'd like to do that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=340.86s)]
*  A really fascinating time period we're in right now. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=341.86s)]
*  Thank you, Raymond. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=344.74s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=345.74s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-10lXgZgmg&t=346.74s)]
