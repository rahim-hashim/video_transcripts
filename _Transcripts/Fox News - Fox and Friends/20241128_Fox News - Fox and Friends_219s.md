# Texas sees victory as appeals court rules it can build a razor wire border wall
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU)
*  President-elect Trump saying he had a very productive conversation with Mexico's president, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=0.0s)]
*  adding she has agreed to stop the massive flow of both migrants and illegal drugs into [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=5.44s)]
*  our country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=10.0s)]
*  Trump posting on Truth Social, quote, this will go a long way towards stopping the illegal [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=11.0s)]
*  invasion of the USA. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=15.56s)]
*  Here to discuss is former DEA Special Operations Director Derek Maltz. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  And Derek, just to be clear, the president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbom Bardo, did clarify [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=22.56s)]
*  some of that discussion, saying we do not agree to close borders. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=28.44s)]
*  That is not our position. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=32.96s)]
*  We're instead going to build bridges between the two people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=34.44s)]
*  But the fact that they had this discussion, Derek, and the fact that it happened three [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=37.02s)]
*  weeks after the presidential election and not in the last three and a half, almost four [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=42.08s)]
*  years under the Biden administration, speaks volumes to me. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=48.52s)]
*  Does it do the same for you? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=52.72s)]
*  Todd, thank you very much for having me. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=54.72s)]
*  First of all, happy Thanksgiving, America. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=57.7s)]
*  I'm very thankful for the positive news about the border and the drug crisis. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=59.260000000000005s)]
*  As we said over the last four years, without border security, we're not going to have a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=63.940000000000005s)]
*  country. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=68.18s)]
*  So thank you, President Trump, for the proactive leadership on these issues. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=69.18s)]
*  I just want to wave the flag because America is coming back very strong. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=72.18s)]
*  And so President Trump has been proactive. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=76.5s)]
*  Now here's the thing I'm very excited about, Todd. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=79.34s)]
*  President Trump talked about the consumption of drugs and the demand has to be addressed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=82.54s)]
*  He's already talking about advertising campaigns. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=87.42s)]
*  Well, to me, somebody that's been in the trenches with the families the last four to seven years, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  right, the families are really happy today because finally we have a president that's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=95.86000000000001s)]
*  going to talk about the dangerous synthetic drugs that are killing our citizens at record [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=100.9s)]
*  level. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=106.38000000000001s)]
*  So I'm thankful for this, too. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=107.38000000000001s)]
*  Meantime, a federal court of appeals, probably you're very thankful for this as well, has [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=109.42s)]
*  ruled that Texas, the state of Texas, has the right to build razor wire border wall [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=112.7s)]
*  and that the Biden administration was wrong to cut it down. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  This is on Texas land. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=121.88s)]
*  Texas said, hey, we have to protect ourselves. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  This doesn't necessarily fall within the ambit of immigration. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=126.44s)]
*  This falls within this is our land and we can do what we want with it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=129.34s)]
*  Will this ruling mean keeping even more fentanyl from crossing our borders than already is [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=133.22s)]
*  as somebody who's an expert in this area, Derek? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  Yes, Todd, this is a huge victory for America and the Trump team is starting to turn around [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  this border disaster. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  One thing I want to tell you, because I was down in Texas with the Texas DPS and the brave [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=149.9s)]
*  men and women on the front lines. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=155.3s)]
*  And I got to tell you, when I received this piece of the wall, right, the Texas wall, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=156.58s)]
*  because the governor has demonstrated leadership not only for Texas, but for all of us in [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=162.06s)]
*  America. So we all need to be thankful and applaud the efforts on the border. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=168.7s)]
*  Despite all the proactive efforts that they've made in Texas, the Biden administration [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=173.06s)]
*  did everything in their power to shut them down. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=178.78s)]
*  So this was a very, very important ruling. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=181.22s)]
*  And I applaud the leadership for the officials in Texas for what they've done. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=183.62s)]
*  Every action that's happening is going to keep America safer. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=188.78s)]
*  And that's what the job of the government is. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=193.26s)]
*  It looks like to me, the insanity at the border is finally going to be turned around [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=195.62s)]
*  and Americans are going to really be rewarded. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=201.78s)]
*  Americans of all stripes, Democrats and Republicans, are going to be rewarded because [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  at the end of the day, it's all of our safety. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=209.62s)]
*  It's all of our lives that are on the line. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=212.06s)]
*  Derek, thanks so much. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=214.5s)]
*  Have a very happy Thanksgiving to you and your family. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZJF9O17lPU&t=215.78s)]
