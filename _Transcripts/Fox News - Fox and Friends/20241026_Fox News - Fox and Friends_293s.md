# Trump to rally at Madison Square Garden as migrant crisis grips NYC
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Tomorrow, Donald Trump takes Manhattan, the former president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=0.72s)]
*  headlining Madison Square Garden, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=3.88s)]
*  as he spreads his message to voters [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=6.24s)]
*  in deep blue strongholds. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=8.16s)]
*  Now, part of that message will likely be illegal immigration, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=10.4s)]
*  still a big, actually huge problem in the Big Apple, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  as polls show it remains a top issue, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=17.3s)]
*  which is 10 days out to the election. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=19.76s)]
*  Here with us is Republican New York City Councilwoman Vicki [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=22.88s)]
*  Palladino. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=27.44s)]
*  She joins us now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=28.44s)]
*  Vicki, how important is illegal immigration to the city? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  I mean, if you walk outside, you're seeing it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=33.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=36.28s)]
*  It's all over. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=36.96s)]
*  This is huge. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=37.92s)]
*  Will it change people's minds? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=39.6s)]
*  I think it will, this go-around. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=41.22s)]
*  The fact that Trump is coming to the garden is tremendous. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=43.24s)]
*  It's going to be packed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=45.88s)]
*  It's exciting. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  But this illegal immigration, as we're calling it, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=48.16s)]
*  this invasion onto our city of over 200,000 migrants, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=51.08s)]
*  be they black, white, blue, green, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=56.6s)]
*  it doesn't really matter, families, no families. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=59.24s)]
*  The fact is that we have turned New York City [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=62.14s)]
*  into a third world country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this used to be a tourist city. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=67.56s)]
*  A lot of these hotels, Vicki, are being taken up [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=69.08s)]
*  by illegal migrants. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=72.48s)]
*  Now, this is being paid for by the city, also federal dollars. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  It's also raising the cost of rooms, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=78.16s)]
*  because there's a scarcity of rooms, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  because so many rooms are being taken up. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=82.0s)]
*  You've famously said, hey, people are getting really, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=84.4s)]
*  there are certain people who want this to happen, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  because they're getting rich from it in the city. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=89.56s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=91.64s)]
*  You have your private hotel. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=93.0s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=94.92s)]
*  There's 150 hotels right now in Manhattan that are [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=95.76s)]
*  being taken over by the illegals. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  Now we come out into the out of boroughs. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  People who own these places as self, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  they own it themselves privately. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  Now, in my district, my one hotel that has migrants in it [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=111.56s)]
*  made these people millionaires. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=117.08s)]
*  So they're making $3 million now, a year, $300,000 a month [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  to house illegals. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  So yes, it's an industry. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  They do not want this to end. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=128.04s)]
*  No. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=129.44s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=129.68s)]
*  Well, listen, we talked about these hotels. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=130.64s)]
*  I actually went outside this past week, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=132.44s)]
*  went outside of a hotel, and engaged [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=134.84s)]
*  with some of these illegal migrants [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=137.2s)]
*  to kind of get an idea of how they got here, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=138.88s)]
*  what's their experience been inside of the hotel, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=142.72s)]
*  and also what kind of services they're getting. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=145.44s)]
*  I want you to hear what this man told me. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=147.6s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=168.84s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=169.44s)]
*  Yelpa? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  How many hours? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=179.08s)]
*  In the morning? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=180.6s)]
*  Yes, in the morning from 8 to 4. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  And most of the children in this daycare [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=184.76s)]
*  are from the hotel or are migrants? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=187.2s)]
*  How is it? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=189.8s)]
*  So that's a service I didn't know was being offered. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=198.84s)]
*  I knew they were getting food. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=201.48s)]
*  They were getting housing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=202.68s)]
*  He's telling me that he's staying at the hotel [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=203.96s)]
*  with his wife and his son. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=207.08s)]
*  His wife works at a restaurant, he told me. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  And he said that his child goes to a daycare. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=212.08s)]
*  I don't know if it's a preschool or a daycare. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=215.52s)]
*  He said daycare for a few hours. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=218.08s)]
*  And he said, well, I'm going to stay here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=221.0s)]
*  I'm going to stay here. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=223.36s)]
*  And he said, well, I'm going to stay here. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=224.32s)]
*  He said daycare for eight hours a day. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=229.92s)]
*  I mean, how many New Yorkers are struggling [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=230.48s)]
*  to pay for daycare? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=232.64s)]
*  I was going to say, look, we have families, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=233.44s)]
*  middle class families, double incomes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  Some of the incomes, one entire paycheck pays for daycare. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=238.4s)]
*  That's what we have right now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=242.16s)]
*  This is a tax burden on the city of New York, as we know. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=243.6s)]
*  We're talking about this now for two years. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=247.4s)]
*  What a lot of people maybe still don't understand [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=249.68s)]
*  is everything, everything they need, they get for free. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=252.4s)]
*  Everything. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=256.8s)]
*  You know, Vicki, what's interesting to me [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=257.56s)]
*  is if you run a charity, generally, you [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=259.36s)]
*  want to brag about all the things [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=262.16s)]
*  that you're doing for your clients. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=263.8s)]
*  In this case, the state and the federal government [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=265.44s)]
*  is not being very transparent of exactly what services they're [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  offering, because I don't think that Americans would be down [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=272.12s)]
*  with this. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=274.6s)]
*  So that was really interesting. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=275.44s)]
*  Vicki, I really appreciate you staying on this [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=276.76s)]
*  and all the information you've given us. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6AqLWYquQ&t=279.0s)]
