# Conway: 'Time may be running out' for longtime Dem senator
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok)
*  All right, with the election just 11 days away and the control of the Senate is on the line, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=0.0s)]
*  we're breaking down the most important back down ballot races of 2024. Fox News contributor, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=4.32s)]
*  she's a poster as well. Kellyanne Conway joins me to break it down. Okay, so let's look at the power [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  rankings right here because I think it tells the story. Right now the balance of power, Democrats [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=13.52s)]
*  have 51, Republicans have 49. But what really matters is what we're looking at right now with [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=17.68s)]
*  the power rankings. That's 48 Democrat seats, one toss up, 51 for the Republicans. And that brings us [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=23.04s)]
*  to this race in Ohio. It's a toss up. Why? It's a toss up because Sherrod Brown has been there so [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=29.84s)]
*  long. Lots of people think he does a great job in Washington, mainly because he's running all these [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=36.16s)]
*  ads, Lawrence, where he's bear hugging Donald Trump. He really doesn't mention Biden, let alone [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=40.72s)]
*  Harris doesn't show up with her when she's in Ohio or anywhere else. And most of his ads right now [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=45.04s)]
*  are I work with Donald Trump on trade and whatnot. But I think Bernie Moreno is surging. He's got a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=50.08s)]
*  great life story. He came here at five years old, youngest of seven from Colombia, the country. He [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=54.8s)]
*  will be the first United States Senator in American history, I believe, born in South America. That's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  exciting. And he's just taking on Brown's fraudulent record. He can't say I'm going to work in a [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=66.0s)]
*  bipartisan fashion and vote with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris all that time. This is a state Ohio, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=71.12s)]
*  Donald Trump carried twice, 2016 and 2020, with 8% of the vote. Jay DuVance obviously is his [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=76.72s)]
*  running mate. I think Sherrod Brown's time may be up here. That's your prediction right there. Let's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=83.12s)]
*  move on to these GOP leaning. Right now you got Sheehy and Tester and just looking right here, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=88.0s)]
*  it doesn't even look close. Yeah, this has been a runaway race. Tim Sheehy, former Navy SEAL, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=93.12s)]
*  very successful businessman, military wife as well. Tester's time has been running short for many [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  years. This is a state Donald Trump carries by double digits. But she's the right kind of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  candidate to take on Tester because he's unafraid to expose Tester's record. Another guy who's a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=108.4s)]
*  phony, frankly, in Montana every six years. You know, I'm farmer John, I'm rancher John. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=113.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, he goes back to Washington and he votes for a very weak agenda in foreign policy, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=119.04s)]
*  a very woke agenda domestically. I think Republicans already have this in their [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=123.84s)]
*  comm along with West Virginia. This is pretty much done. But what about my home state of Texas? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=127.28s)]
*  Kamala Harris is going to be here. They think they can win this, but I'm still hearing crews [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=131.12s)]
*  on the ground. They say this every six years. Crews, I know that Steve Daines feels very good [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=135.12s)]
*  about this race, the chairman of the NRC. They're going to spend a ton of money, but they did that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=140.08s)]
*  with Beto O'Rourke last time, a guy who's run unsuccessfully for Senate governor and president [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=144.08s)]
*  United States, a whole trifecta of losses. Go home and be with your kids. Yeah. So look, I think [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  we're starting at 51 Republican, 49 Democrat. Why is this important? Kamala Harris has broken [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  more ties in the United States Senate, Lawrence, than almost any vice president in history. The [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=160.8s)]
*  vice president breaks ties in such a tight Senate. This is important for the agenda. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  And also I got there in early 2017 with president Trump. We had a majority in the house. We had a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=170.24s)]
*  majority in the Senate with Republicans. They didn't repeal and replace Obamacare. He couldn't [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=174.8s)]
*  get infrastructure passed. Tax Cut and Jobs Act got signed December 2nd, not March 2nd, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  because you sometimes have these Republicans who flip to the other side, want something they're [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  not getting. And it's hard to rely upon Democrats. I think if President Trump can find a couple [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=186.64s)]
*  Democrats who say that Tax Cut and Jobs Act, the DREG agenda has benefited my state, I'm going to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=191.76s)]
*  cross over. That's key. Let's look at some of those Democrats because it's a lot on the board. They [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=197.44s)]
*  had a tough map for them. To start here with Michigan real quickly, who's going to win this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  right here between Slock and- Well, Slock is ahead, but she's really been suffering and she's been [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  sounding the alarm bells that Harris is not doing as well there. Obviously, the Arab American vote [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=209.44s)]
*  is very tough for Kamala Harris. She has to deal with her whole Hamas caucus. And Rogers, I know [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=215.68s)]
*  he's got the money now. I think people in his campaign think he's been surging. Pennsylvania [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  is another one that is more likely to flip. What's your prediction on that? So we had McCormick [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  ahead a few weeks ago for the first time ever in our polling, up by 148-47. A little bit of a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=230.96s)]
*  Butler Bumper in the field, October 4th to 7th. But having said that, Casey is traditionally under [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=235.84s)]
*  50% and then pulls it out in the end. McCormick has been able to keep Casey where he is. I think [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=241.76s)]
*  McCormick's run a great campaign. I've got 10 seconds. The Maryland race, though. Hogan separated [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=248.72s)]
*  from Donald Trump. He was the former governor there. He was popular one time, but it doesn't [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=252.64s)]
*  seem like it's working in the polls. He thought he was going to run against Dave Trump, which would [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  have been an easier target for him. Let me say about all these races, every Republican, especially [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  in these swing states, presidentially, they're banking on Donald Trump's energy, enthusiasm, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=263.68s)]
*  momentum to bring them over the finish line. That's okay, but you have to run your own race, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=268.48s)]
*  too. In fact, in 2022, President Trump was overly unfairly blamed for a lot of those Senate losses. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=272.88s)]
*  This time, they're banking on him to pull them over. Kellyanne Conway looking at all the races. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=278.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ5r_Cxi2ok&t=282.96000000000004s)]
