# Tom Brady calls 'BS' on Chiefs conspiracy before first Super Bowl as broadcaster
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo)
*  In just two days the Philadelphia Eagles will take on the Kansas City Chiefs in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=0.0s)]
*  Super Bowl on Fox as the Chiefs go for an historic three Pete. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=7.86s)]
*  So there's a lot of new things to this game including the seven time Super Bowl champion [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=13.1s)]
*  calling the game as Fox Sports lead analyst Tom Brady the seven time champ who played [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=16.62s)]
*  in 10 joins us now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=22.14s)]
*  Tom I know you've been down this road as a fan and a player as a broadcaster. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=24.44s)]
*  How have you prepared for this one over the rest of the games this season. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=30.1s)]
*  Well I've been a lot of times studying a lot of film reading all the different packets [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  of information I get and trying to kind of make my notes and try to be really prepared [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=39.88s)]
*  for anything that can happen. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=46.02s)]
*  I think the difference is a player you're really prepared for one side of the ball as a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=47.22s)]
*  broadcaster you have to prepare for both offenses both defenses. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=51.34s)]
*  There's a lot of things that you have on your sheet that you really want to get to. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=55.78s)]
*  But the reality is and even for this being a long game I can't even get to all the stuff [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=60.46000000000001s)]
*  that I've already prepared for. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=64.74000000000001s)]
*  But I'm really looking forward to a great game. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=66.02000000000001s)]
*  Both teams kind of had unique journeys to get to this point but they're both so deserving [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=68.42s)]
*  to get be here in New Orleans playing for a world championship. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=73.9s)]
*  So Tom you you did a podcast recently. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=78.38s)]
*  You talked about how tough it is going against Steve Magnolia the defensive coordinator [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=80.86s)]
*  and how all the film that you watch over the years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=86.66s)]
*  Talk about that challenge in this game and something that the Eagles are going to have [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=90.22s)]
*  to overcome. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=94.1s)]
*  He's a phenomenal defensive coach and he I said earlier in the season he's the bane of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=97.02s)]
*  my existence. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=102.26s)]
*  And in fact when we were in the production meeting the other day Chris Jones the great [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=103.62s)]
*  defensive tackle for the chief said Tommy we hired him because he's the one that could [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=106.86s)]
*  beat you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=111.58s)]
*  And they brought him in in 2019 and they've had a magical run with him as kind of leading [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=112.77999999999999s)]
*  that defense. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=119.5s)]
*  And they're a very challenging defense to go against. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=120.22s)]
*  They put a lot of pressure on the opposing quarterback Jalen Hurts and on will be the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=122.13999999999999s)]
*  Eagles offensive line. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=126.74s)]
*  They have so many unique blitzes different alignments and how coach Spagnuolo calls the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=128.7s)]
*  game. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=134.54s)]
*  You have to be on high alert if you're the Eagles offensive line and the quarterback [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=135.29999999999998s)]
*  he's going to put a lot of pressure on those guys to be right in their communication all [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=139.29999999999998s)]
*  the time. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=142.94s)]
*  And I'm sure there's going to be plenty of times where those blitzes are going to be [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=143.42s)]
*  really successful. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=147.1s)]
*  They're going to get to hurt and he's got to make good decisions with the ball so that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=147.98s)]
*  they don't create any unnecessary turnovers because that's really the story of the game [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  whose possession of the football to me is going to determine the outcome of this game. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  You know Tom it's so amazing to have you in the Fox family. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=160.98s)]
*  We were so excited when you signed that contract. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=163.98s)]
*  Welcome to the team. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=166.38s)]
*  And I can't even believe we're talking to you because we followed your whole career. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=167.98s)]
*  What you did in the Patriots for the Patriots what you did in Tampa was just remarkable. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=171.06s)]
*  And we saw you retire and then come back and everyone was excited. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm sure that was a hard decision to make. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=177.98s)]
*  But now being in the box is it is it hard is it difficult to not be out there on the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=179.9s)]
*  field. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=184.18s)]
*  I look back on my playing career and I feel like I I there was nothing left in the tank [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=187.46s)]
*  and I would I'd love to throw the football. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=192.22s)]
*  I still do that all the time. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  I'll always be something I love to do. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=196.54000000000002s)]
*  I mean football was truly my first love and I love competing at the highest level but [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=197.98000000000002s)]
*  I loved all the elements that came with playing football the camaraderie but also trying [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=203.66s)]
*  to master yourself trying to master your physical skill trying to master the preparation [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  of the game. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=214.78s)]
*  And then I always got myself to to an emotional kind of feverish pitch by game day. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=215.26000000000002s)]
*  I knew that I was only competing for three hours a week. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=221.9s)]
*  I wanted to be at my very best and I tried to take that approach every day in practice [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=224.74s)]
*  so that I could be prepared for moments like this. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=229.74s)]
*  The Super Bowl preparation didn't start for these teams. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=231.78s)]
*  You know after the AFC and NFC Championship Championship games they started in the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=235.9s)]
*  summertime six seven months ago when these teams came together they had a belief that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=240.38s)]
*  they would be here in this moment and that's ultimately what they're preparing for and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=245.14000000000001s)]
*  that's what championship organizations are all about. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=248.46s)]
*  You don't wait for big moments for them to become big moments. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=251.34s)]
*  You live those moments every day like they are big moments so you're prepared when the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=254.62s)]
*  moment arises. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=258.06s)]
*  So if you want to be able to deal with pressure you better put pressure on yourself all the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  time to succeed. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=262.62s)]
*  And if you do that you're going to put yourself like these teams are now in in this place [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=263.94s)]
*  with this opportunity to go out there and win this world championship. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  So there's so many preparations with the 10 Super Bowls you've been in. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  There was so many times you always get you always made eye contact with people. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=277.14s)]
*  You tried to answer them be respectful. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=280.14000000000004s)]
*  But then this one young man asked you this question in 2017 and it really stuck out [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=282.38s)]
*  with us. Let's watch. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=287.86s)]
*  Who's my hero. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  Well I think my dad is my hero because he's someone that I look up to every day. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=295.26000000000005s)]
*  And. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=301.14000000000004s)]
*  My dad. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=308.02000000000004s)]
*  So. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=310.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=316.22s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=319.26000000000005s)]
*  That was a young kid asking you a question and it caught you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  What were you thinking now. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=324.06s)]
*  And does it bring you back then of the journey you got went through to be where you are [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=325.54s)]
*  today. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=330.5s)]
*  Yeah I was so blessed to have a mom and dad that supported my athletic and career journey [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=332.34000000000003s)]
*  step of the way. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=339.78s)]
*  And I was had a great foundation about family and about commitment support for one [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=340.7s)]
*  another. And at the time my mom was battling breast cancer and my dad was there supporting my [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=347.94s)]
*  mom through her treatments. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=355.46s)]
*  And it was a very challenging time for our family. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=358.17999999999995s)]
*  And I just think about my dad and the commitment that he's made to her to my sisters to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=361.34s)]
*  myself to his grandkids and he's the greatest man I've ever known. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=365.38s)]
*  And I still feel that way. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=371.06s)]
*  I try to make him proud and everything that I do. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=372.41999999999996s)]
*  And when you have an example like that as your like I did with my dad I can just take what he [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=375.29999999999995s)]
*  taught me and try to be that kind of dad that I am for my kids. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=382.46s)]
*  You know Tom. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=386.17999999999995s)]
*  That's ultimately how I can. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=386.94s)]
*  Sorry. Go ahead. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=388.73999999999995s)]
*  No I'm sorry about that Tom. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=389.58s)]
*  To that point I guess the question because you have all this experience now you're in the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=391.02s)]
*  booth I guess what is the one piece of advice you would give to these players some of them. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=394.74s)]
*  This is their first time going to the Super Bowl. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=399.38s)]
*  That piece of advice that you wish someone would have told you for that first moment. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=402.02s)]
*  What would you tell them. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=406.46000000000004s)]
*  I think a big part of this this experience ultimately comes down to what you do on game [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=409.66s)]
*  day. And all these things are really nice and getting all the logistics done and the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=415.82s)]
*  tickets and being part of this Super Bowl extravaganza is awesome. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=420.38s)]
*  It's a really an event. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=424.38s)]
*  It brings so many families together. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=425.42s)]
*  So many of these players will reflect on the times where they weren't playing in the game [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=427.42s)]
*  and they were there at home with a barbecue with all the dips and chips and all the food [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=430.9s)]
*  and people just enjoying the game. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=438.06s)]
*  And now they're in this moment. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=439.58s)]
*  And what they remember from this week will ultimately be the game. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=441.5s)]
*  And all these other things are great. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=445.74s)]
*  But do everything you can to not let anything get in the way of your preparation. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=447.46s)]
*  And it still goes from now up until game time. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=452.98s)]
*  There's a lot of things that can distract you or take your mind away from what ultimately [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=456.26s)]
*  the goal is. And the goal is to go out here and win the game. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=461.26s)]
*  Whatever it takes for however long it takes. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=464.38s)]
*  These guys need to be locked in for those ends up being about a four hour game and [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=467.34s)]
*  everything they can do to conserve their energy to be prepared when when it matters most. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=471.94s)]
*  That's really where they need to lock in. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=476.98s)]
*  Tom your parents clearly did a great job with you. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=479.1s)]
*  And for all of us that are raising kids what advice do you have for our children who [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=481.70000000000005s)]
*  maybe are too scared to take their sport to the next level or a little bit too lazy to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=486.18s)]
*  finish all of their homework. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=490.02000000000004s)]
*  What what what advice do you have for the young people that look up to you. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=491.26000000000005s)]
*  Well I was very much just like an American normal American kid that wanted to grow up [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=495.86s)]
*  and chase my dreams. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=500.46000000000004s)]
*  I would say my parents they never they never kind of tempered my expectations for what [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=501.5s)]
*  I thought I could accomplish when I wanted to go to Michigan. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=506.90000000000003s)]
*  They didn't think I might be too hard for you. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=510.62s)]
*  You should probably pick a school or maybe you're going to go play earlier plays a [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=512.98s)]
*  freshman. I always had this belief that I could do it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=516.06s)]
*  And my parents the whole time said you could do it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=519.02s)]
*  Absolutely. I was one of the slowest players at the NFL combine when I got drafted [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=521.22s)]
*  by the New England Patriots and my mom you say honey you are so fast. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=527.54s)]
*  You get out there on that field and you can run. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=531.5799999999999s)]
*  And certainly I know I couldn't. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=534.46s)]
*  I said mom I love you. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=536.1s)]
*  You're very biased toward your son. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=536.9s)]
*  But I think the reality is is they never there was never a plan B for me. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=538.9s)]
*  I never had to deal with that. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=543.66s)]
*  And I think they supported me and I got a belief in myself because you need people [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=544.86s)]
*  to believe in you even when you don't always have the most confidence in yourself. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=549.22s)]
*  And if you're surrounded by people that love you that are there for you when you [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=554.22s)]
*  fail because the reality is in life when we try things that are very difficult we do [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=557.9s)]
*  fail because they're hard. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=562.3000000000001s)]
*  And when they're hard and you overcome them you learn a lot about yourself. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=564.3s)]
*  And if you can apply those things going forward to accomplish what you want you're [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=568.14s)]
*  going to gain a lot of self-esteem and a lot of self-confidence. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=571.66s)]
*  Yeah you know I've always felt that trying trying things that were outside of my [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=574.9399999999999s)]
*  comfort zone ended up being the best things in my life and having parents that [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=578.42s)]
*  supported me when I did fail. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=582.26s)]
*  That was the biggest blessing in my life. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=584.42s)]
*  No plan B. Yeah. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=585.78s)]
*  And reading your story and you talked about it you know you weren't starting. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=586.98s)]
*  So a coach walked up to you and said your practices are your games. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=591.1800000000001s)]
*  Take every single practice like the games. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=594.7s)]
*  And sure enough in a couple of years you were starting and you still had to split [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=597.38s)]
*  the games in college oftentimes. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=600.4200000000001s)]
*  And then when he got to the pros do you think part of your success is the chip on [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=602.5s)]
*  your shoulder from being a six round draft pick. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=606.74s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=610.34s)]
*  I feel like overcoming those challenges and adversities that I had whether it was [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=611.0600000000001s)]
*  on high school and college allowed me to be the professional athlete that I was. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=614.94s)]
*  I learned a lot of things through failing that a lot of guys didn't learn through [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=620.2199999999999s)]
*  high school and college because they were the best athletes. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=623.9799999999999s)]
*  So these sustainable qualities that you have as an athlete like your work ethic [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=626.7399999999999s)]
*  like your discipline like your determination and competitiveness those are [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=631.9799999999999s)]
*  what people would call intangibles because we can go measure physical strength [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=636.5s)]
*  or speed or all the things that are important. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=640.62s)]
*  But in the end they're not sustainable over the course of a 23 year career. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=643.0999999999999s)]
*  And I look at what we're doing to college kids and high school kids and we make it [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=647.42s)]
*  so easy on them now if you don't like where you're at go somewhere else where [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=651.5s)]
*  you can play and it goes from being let's say college or high school a [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=654.86s)]
*  transformational experience to a transactional experience. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=659.86s)]
*  And you're always trying to transform yourself into something a little bit more [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=663.54s)]
*  into a little bit better version of yourself. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=667.38s)]
*  But when you make it easy on yourself in the end you're doing yourself a disservice [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=669.38s)]
*  because you're not challenging yourself to get outside your comfort zone. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=673.74s)]
*  And if you get outside your comfort zone you're going to realize like oh man I'm [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=676.98s)]
*  kind of on my own but I've got people that support me but how do I figure this [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=680.86s)]
*  out. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=684.3s)]
*  And part of that figuring it out is to dig a little deeper within yourself and to [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=685.18s)]
*  develop a better work ethic to be a little bit more disciplined in what you're [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=689.18s)]
*  doing and to be more determined to accomplish it every single day. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=693.86s)]
*  And if you if you cheat that in the end you cheat yourself and you're never going [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=697.74s)]
*  to accomplish your goals you're going to be settling for your plan B's your [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=701.5s)]
*  entire life. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=704.26s)]
*  You're giving people wisdom that you just cannot buy time. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=705.4200000000001s)]
*  I want to switch gears with you. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=709.3000000000001s)]
*  It seems like there's a cloud over this game when it comes to the officiating [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=710.94s)]
*  from your perspective. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=714.74s)]
*  Is that just all noise or do you think there's some legitimate concern when it [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=716.1800000000001s)]
*  comes to that. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=720.9000000000001s)]
*  I think it's just all BS. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=723.7800000000001s)]
*  It's just a bunch of noise and these refs have very challenging jobs to do. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=725.3800000000001s)]
*  I'm very happy Twitter didn't exist during the tuck rule game in 2001. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=730.22s)]
*  Let me say that. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=734.58s)]
*  Yeah I would have been on the wrong end of a lot of those. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=735.5400000000001s)]
*  But these refs are out there trying to do their very best. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=738.22s)]
*  They've got to make decisions in a split second and they're going to call what [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=741.26s)]
*  they see and these guys are some of the most professional people on the field. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=745.62s)]
*  They just want to go out and do a good job like everybody else. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=750.7s)]
*  And look sometimes the calls go your way sometimes they don't. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=752.7800000000001s)]
*  In the end over the course of a of a hundred and forty play game on both sides [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=756.22s)]
*  of the ball the players have plenty of opportunities to go out there and make an [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=761.18s)]
*  impact on the game winning or losing. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=764.9s)]
*  And that's that's what I'm excited to see on Sunday night. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=766.54s)]
*  So your year's almost done. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=769.5s)]
*  You had your best game in the championship game. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=770.66s)]
*  You signed your contract with Fox. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=772.8199999999999s)]
*  Well you're still playing. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=774.3s)]
*  So you took a year off before you started. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=775.58s)]
*  Now the one year is done. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=777.3s)]
*  Have you enjoyed it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=779.14s)]
*  Has this been what you thought. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=780.42s)]
*  Is this something that you're going to want to do long term. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=781.86s)]
*  And have you gotten used to the producers talking in your ear. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=784.14s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=789.06s)]
*  There's a lot of there's an art and science that says you guys know and you guys are so great. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=789.86s)]
*  You're on every day you know doing your best. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=793.86s)]
*  And there's I think the more I've done it the more comfortable I've gotten with it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=796.22s)]
*  And it's something that I'm going to continue to get comfortable doing. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=800.7s)]
*  And the more comfortable I've got the more relaxed I've gotten. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=803.0600000000001s)]
*  And then ultimately it just sounds more and more like myself. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=805.86s)]
*  So I'm still I really believe in those 10,000 hours that you need to practice in order to be truly great at something. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=808.5s)]
*  And I'm I'm about 300 hours into this. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=816.3000000000001s)]
*  And I've got another year doing at least nine years left on my contract and and hopefully many more years beyond that. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=819.02s)]
*  Well we're enjoying it. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=824.7s)]
*  Great job. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=826.0600000000001s)]

*  Thanks so much. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=839.38s)]
*  Good luck Sunday. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=840.34s)]

*  It's going to be great. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=844.58s)]
*  I mean it's one of these things we don't want to miss minute. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrXXEVYIPDo&t=845.4200000000001s)]
