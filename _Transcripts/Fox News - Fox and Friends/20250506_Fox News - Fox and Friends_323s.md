# Air traffic control problems 'will get worse,' warns fighter pilot
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI)
*  Fox News alert here, chaos at Newark Airport. The FAA struggles with some major staffing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=0.0s)]
*  issues and it comes just one week after air traffic controllers lost communication with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=5.44s)]
*  Newark planes. So the outage lasted between 60 and 90 seconds. Here's how the tower controllers [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=10.16s)]
*  reacted when the incoming pilot asked for clearance. Listen up. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=16.2s)]
*  We lost our radar and it's not working correctly. Radar service terminates, walk me up to our [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=20.12s)]
*  tower. If you want a Bravo clearance, call the tower. It's going to get closer. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=24.12s)]
*  Okay, I'll wait for that frequency from you, okay? Okay, no, just walk me as far, look [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=29.12s)]
*  up the tower frequencies. We don't have a radar, so I don't know where you are. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  Let's bring in Matthew Wiz Buckley, FAA-18 fighter pilot, former commercial airline [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=37.96s)]
*  pilot. It's the first time we've heard that audio. To me, it's very chilling. If you count [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  by yourself, 60 to 90 seconds, you think how long that is and how quickly these things [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=47.16s)]
*  are happening and moving. Get your thoughts as a pilot here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=53.0s)]
*  Good morning, Dana. Good morning, Bill. Obviously, 60 to 90 seconds when you're moving at hundreds [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=56.36s)]
*  of miles an hour is pretty critical. Sadly, this is going to get worse before it gets [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=62.2s)]
*  better. Our air traffic control system is based on radar from the 50s and 60s. We got [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=68.0s)]
*  GPS in the late 80s, mid 90s. We are dealing with an antiquated system and we are also [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=73.52s)]
*  dealing with folks that are overworked and can just randomly walk off the job. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=79.96s)]
*  But Bill and Dana, the number one rule as an aviator in the front of one of these aircraft [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=85.28s)]
*  is don't hit anything. Don't hit another aircraft or anything attached to the ground. As you [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  and I, we've all been talking since the DC mishap, pilots have to see and avoid. Worst [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=96.16s)]
*  case scenario, if the radar does go down, eyeballs out of the cockpit, don't hit anything [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  So there are, you know, default things that we can do if the radar goes down, but obviously [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=107.28s)]
*  not optimum. Are you saying this headline was worse than reality? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, I'll leave that to you all. Losing radar is just not good, especially in a congested [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=115.72s)]
*  area up in the Northeast. You never want to have this happen. But sadly, this is going [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=126.44s)]
*  to get worse before it gets better. Secretary Duffy saying that we still use sloppy disks [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=131.36s)]
*  and vacuum tubes in the air traffic control system. I'm old enough to remember those, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=136.52s)]
*  but there are people on this planet that don't even know what that technology is. But it's [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=141.24s)]
*  sad that the government doesn't react until something is at a crisis and a breaking point. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=145.08s)]
*  And even then we're still stuck in lag and not reacting soon enough. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=150.24s)]
*  Can you talk about the number of air traffic controllers that we have? Do we need more? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=154.0s)]
*  Is the recruiting as big a problem as some suggest? And possibly even the pay, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=159.32s)]
*  Because as I understand it, the entry level would be $47,000. They tried to figure something [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=164.88s)]
*  out for regions where the cost of living is a little bit more expensive. But in terms [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  of finding the right people to do these jobs, is that a problem? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=175.34s)]
*  Well, Dana, talk about an air antiquated air traffic control system. There's antiquated [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=180.48s)]
*  air traffic controllers. So when the airlines got stressed years ago and said, hey, we need [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=185.84s)]
*  to raise the age for pilots, the retirement age went from 60 to 65. Air traffic controllers [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  retired 56. And if you read, it's because it's stressful and all that type of stuff. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=197.16s)]
*  Last time I checked, flying an airline are full of hundreds of people is pretty darn [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=202.02s)]
*  stressful as well. So and they also have an age ceiling of 31. You can't be older than [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  31 to be an air traffic controller. And I'm old. If I wanted to go back to fly for FedEx [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=211.88s)]
*  or American at this point, they would take me. I still have, I'm not going to age myself, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=218.0s)]
*  but let's just say maybe nine years left in aviation. So there's a lot of stuff in the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=222.32s)]
*  air traffic control system on the personnel side that needs to be fixed. I'm old enough [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=226.6s)]
*  to remember Ronald Reagan. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=231.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you can go back to the 80s if you want with Reagan, but you know, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=232.24s)]
*  We got Bush for eight years, Obama eight years, Trump, Biden, Trump. How did it get so bad [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=236.92s)]
*  when you understand that air travel in America has only gotten more popular? And I don't [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=243.56s)]
*  think we're going back against that trend either. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=249.2s)]
*  Bill, this isn't your first radio, my brother. You know, the DC think that the wheels move [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=253.64s)]
*  slowly and we always, it's a tired trope, but you kick the can down the road and the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=259.88s)]
*  current administration is always going to blame the previous administration. This has been a [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=265.0s)]
*  problem since the 60s and 70s. And you all just alluded to air traffic. Air travel has [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=268.88s)]
*  exploded. So it's always the fault of the person before us. But right now, the Trump [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  administration is the commanding officer. Secretary Duffy is committed to fixing these [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  issues. But this has been, to use a bad example, this has been a train wreck in the making [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  and it needs to be fixed immediately. If we used more AI and technology, air traffic control [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  sequencing would be near flawless, almost flawless. Nothing is truly flawless. But still, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=294.36s)]
*  there is so much technology out there that we could use immediately. I just don't get why [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=299.96s)]
*  we're not doing it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=304.92s)]
*  All right, Wiz. Thank you so much. We'll continue to follow this story. It impacts a lot of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVPKR4QVrI&t=305.84s)]
