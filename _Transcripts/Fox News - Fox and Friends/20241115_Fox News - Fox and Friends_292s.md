# Sylvester Stallone: I'm in awe he pulled this off
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM)
*  Meanwhile yesterday was the first time we had a chance to hear Donald Trump talk in length about his remarkable election victory [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=0.0s)]
*  That's historic in so many ways and it's got to be gratifying to him capping off the greatest comeback [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=6.26s)]
*  And we know maybe global according to the president of Argentina in all of political history and what it took to get there [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=11.16s)]
*  So Sylvester Stallone was one of the many celebrities that showed up last night to say I can't believe what you were able to pull off [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=18.68s)]
*  We are in the presence of a really mythical character [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=25.72s)]
*  I love mythology and this individual does not exist on this planet [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Nobody in the world could have pulled off what he pulled off. So I'm in awe [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=37.16s)]
*  And I'll just say this and I mean it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  When George Washington defended his country, he had no idea [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=48.16s)]
*  That he was going to change the world [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=53.72s)]
*  Because without him you can imagine what the world would look like. Guess what? We got the second George Washington. Congratulations [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=56.16s)]
*  Thank you very much Wow [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=76.96s)]
*  Thank you Sly you you know Sly does not do that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=79.83999999999999s)]
*  He doesn't do that stuff and he did a beautiful job and we're gonna turn our country around [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=82.88s)]
*  We're gonna make it so great so strong so powerful [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  We're gonna bring it all back I [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=91.8s)]
*  Want to thank some people that have been so instrumental in doing such a great job. We have a man who is a [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  Seriously high IQ, you know, I'm a person that believes in high IQs and his is about as high as they get [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=101.96s)]
*  He launched a rocket three weeks ago and then he went to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=108.04s)]
*  Pennsylvania the campaign because he considered this more important than launching rockets that cost billions of dollars [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=112.04s)]
*  Elon Musk another one who's another great mind and a great guy and so popular and I think he's right [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=117.48s)]
*  He wants to make people healthy. It's driven him pretty wild over the last number of years [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  Today I nominated him for I guess if you like health and if you like people that live a long time [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=129.56s)]
*  It's the most important position [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=135.24s)]
*  RFK jr. Bobby and a woman who was a Democrat and was a [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=137.28s)]
*  Independent she went independent and last week [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=144.84s)]
*  She said I want to be a Republican because this is what I stand for and I've always admired her and I've admired her [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=147.28s)]
*  Because she was loaded up with common sense and it's all about common sense [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, we're conservative in this room, but we we can understand the other side [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  But what we really are as people with common sense and I think that's why we won with the numbers that we won by [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=162.88s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, I agree with him [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  I think that he focused on the common sense issues things that we all are dealing with on an everyday basis [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=172.72s)]
*  Instead of going so woke so extreme [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=179.04s)]
*  Like the other party did Doug Bergham. It's gonna be great on interior. He's gonna be working with EPA Lee Zeldin [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=182.44s)]
*  It's gonna be fantastic and I look forward to these hearings [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  I think these are senators gonna look to blow up at typical [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=191.16s)]
*  Democratic summer is gonna look to blow up RFK gonna look to do damage to Pete look to do damage to Tulsi and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=194.48s)]
*  The problem is I don't think they know what they're getting into they understand the big picture [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=199.96s)]
*  They understand the issues and they're very comfortable in their own skin as broadcasters. So good luck with that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=204.12s)]
*  So I look forward to the president's getting a new team. He wants quickly [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=210.12s)]
*  Make this pack the schedule make them work weekends [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=215.12s)]
*  I respect the senator's right to advise and consent [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=218.44s)]
*  I just hope they understand that the former president campaigned on massive change and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=221.76s)]
*  You can't reject what the voters said. I know they may think differently [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=228.12s)]
*  But he was not shy about [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=233.32s)]
*  Putting some of these people in no [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=236.52s)]
*  He did not say the names of all of them [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=238.48s)]
*  But he did promise radical change and you got to respect the voters when they said that's exactly what they wanted a supermajority [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=240.44s)]
*  He got them. All right. Meanwhile, Joe Rogan was one of the people that came out and said the celebrities are calling him up saying [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=247.64s)]
*  Thank you for making the hard choice and doing the endorsement [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  Because there's so many people out there who are tired of the political correctness and are glad Donald Trump won [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=256.03999999999996s)]
*  He hopefully the other cars can endorse. I know he interviewed Trump and it was three hours [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=260.59999999999997s)]
*  He endorsed him the day before the election [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=263.96s)]
*  Is that right the day before it matters and they're probably gonna meet Saturday night because they're gonna be at the UFC event at MSG [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  I wonder if they're gonna have a comedian open up. I'm not sure [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ClDVqRfhM&t=272.91999999999996s)]
