# Melania Trump reveals what she loves most about her husband: 'It's unbelievable'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88)
*  All right, a Fox News exclusive, Melania Trump is setting the record straight ahead of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=0.0s)]
*  release of our new memoir called Melania. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=5.78s)]
*  She gives us an inside look at her personal life from her relationship with the former [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=9.08s)]
*  president to the devastating loss of her mother earlier this year. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=14.06s)]
*  We were able to sit down with the former first lady for this exclusive sneak sneak peek before [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=18.96s)]
*  her new book hit shelves next month. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=24.2s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=26.48s)]
*  You said in the book, you said sometimes in order to succeed, you must be willing to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=28.76s)]
*  take risks. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  How did the risks early on as a model prepare you for life as the first lady? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  I think nothing prepared me more to be first lady in front of the world than the fashion [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=39.64s)]
*  industry. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=46.08s)]
*  The fashion industry, it's glamorous, but it's at the same time very tough. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=47.52s)]
*  And as everybody judges you, look at you a certain way. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=55.2s)]
*  So it can be mean world as well. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  So nothing prepared me more for this world than fashion. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  It gives you a thick skin. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=71.54s)]
*  So it was August 27th, 1996, and you had this modeling contract. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=73.84s)]
*  You have two suitcases, a carry on and a passport. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=79.72s)]
*  That is all you brought with you to America. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=83.76s)]
*  And my portfolio. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=85.96s)]
*  And your portfolio. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=86.96s)]
*  That was very important. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=87.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=88.96s)]
*  You need to find a job. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=89.96s)]
*  So you hit the ground running. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=91.64s)]
*  You didn't even go to your apartment. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=93.28s)]
*  You immediately went to work. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=94.72s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=96.32s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=97.32s)]
*  Well, when I arrived to New York City, I still remember it was Tuesday afternoon, early afternoon. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=98.32s)]
*  I went directly from the airport to the agency. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=103.92s)]
*  So I start right away. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=107.52s)]
*  You sign the contract. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=110.58s)]
*  They copy your portfolio and you start. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=113.56s)]
*  So it was an exciting time. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=118.68s)]
*  So 10 years later, after arriving here, you find yourself raising your right hand and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and becoming an American citizen. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=126.64s)]
*  You had no idea at that moment you would go on to become the first lady of the United [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=131.04s)]
*  States of America. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=135.78s)]
*  What did that day becoming a citizen mean to you? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=137.94s)]
*  I was very proud. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=142.1s)]
*  I went through the process. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=143.74s)]
*  And that day was a big celebration. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=147.06s)]
*  Was very, very proud. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=151.02s)]
*  So meeting Donald Trump, how did you meet him? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=153.08s)]
*  We met at the party and you could read the whole chapter in the book. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=161.74s)]
*  You are at the KitKat club and there was that moment of connection. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=162.74s)]
*  And then you refused to give him your number and you asked for his number. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=165.66s)]
*  And you went on a modeling shoot in the Caribbean. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=171.64s)]
*  And while you're down there, you couldn't stop thinking about him. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=173.89999999999998s)]
*  And so you came home and you called him. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=176.61999999999998s)]
*  What happened? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=179.76s)]
*  We went to the first on the first date, if you could call it a date, because it was mixed [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=180.76s)]
*  with professionalism. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  And I completely understand now that I know him more. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  That was so it was so him. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=193.48s)]
*  I liked in one way about it because I, you know, I was the same and I love the vision [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=196.7s)]
*  that he had and the connection that we had. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=203.38s)]
*  So it was very special. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=206.74s)]
*  You get in the car and he drives you to Bedford and outside of the city, what an hour outside [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=208.12s)]
*  of the city, and he wanted to show you a business or some property that he had. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=213.5s)]
*  So he was combining business with taking you on a first date. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=217.74s)]
*  And it was very nice because we were two of us alone in the car for an hour, hour and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=222.02s)]
*  a half. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=227.82000000000002s)]
*  And it's no other noise, no other people, because at that time he was already known [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=229.06s)]
*  and a celebrity. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=235.10000000000002s)]
*  So it was really nice to be just two of us. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=236.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=240.18s)]
*  Did you fall in love then? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=241.18s)]
*  It was a connection. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=243.56s)]
*  It was a connection. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=244.56s)]
*  You said our chemistry was undeniable. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  Our connection felt natural. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=248.62s)]
*  In private, he revealed himself as a gentleman, displaying tenderness and thoughtfulness. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=250.42s)]
*  Did he ever say to you in those early stages or even in that first car ride, I'm going [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=257.82s)]
*  to be president one day? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=261.68s)]
*  No, we didn't discuss that time. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=263.02s)]
*  Did he tell you eventually? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=265.41999999999996s)]
*  Did you know? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=266.41999999999996s)]
*  Soon later. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=267.41999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=268.41999999999996s)]
*  Soon later. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=269.41999999999996s)]
*  Not that he would be the president, but he always was involved in politics. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=270.41999999999996s)]
*  He was very in tune what's going on in the world, especially in this country. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=277.12s)]
*  Six years into the relationship, it's April of 2004, and he proposes to you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=283.68s)]
*  Well, it was, first of all, it was my birthday as well. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=288.64s)]
*  And it was a Met Gala. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=291.96s)]
*  So it was all in one. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=293.52s)]
*  We were all ready at home, both of us in black tie. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  So he proposed that time. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=299.56s)]
*  Describe your wedding day. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=302.3s)]
*  It was January 22nd, 2005. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=303.3s)]
*  It was almost a year after you were engaged and you got married at Bethesda by the Sea, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=305.56s)]
*  beautiful church down in Palm Beach, and then the reception at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=310.76s)]
*  What was that day like for you and your family and your mom? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  It was an exciting day, a busy, busy day. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  As every bride, you want to make sure everything goes smoothly. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=323.32s)]
*  And it went. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=327.96s)]
*  We had a good day. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=328.96s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=330.59999999999997s)]
*  There was a touching story in the book about the baptism candle. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=331.74s)]
*  Your mom brought this over from Slovenia. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=335.02s)]
*  It was the candle that was lit in the church when you were baptized. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=336.96s)]
*  You lit it at your wedding, and then you lit it again when Baron was baptized. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=340.14s)]
*  And you still have it, I assume. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=345.56s)]
*  I still have it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=346.7s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=348.18s)]
*  I was baptized on Donald's birthday. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=349.18s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=351.18s)]
*  June 14. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=352.18s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=353.18s)]
*  The dates connects. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=354.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=355.18s)]
*  So, my mother, she thought about it and she brought it here to the United States. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=356.26s)]
*  And you say in the book about becoming a mother, you said, I stepped back from public life, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=362.66s)]
*  no longer one of the glamorous photo shoots and the jet-setting lifestyle, and my career [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=367.06s)]
*  took a backseat. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=371.76s)]
*  Was that a hard change for you? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=373.34000000000003s)]
*  It was not. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=374.94s)]
*  No. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=375.94s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=376.94s)]
*  Because I had a different purpose in life. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=377.94s)]
*  The best day of your life when they put the baby in your arms? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=379.58s)]
*  Something changes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=383.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=384.9s)]
*  There's a picture in the book, and you're working at the desk, and you have Baron in [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=386.62s)]
*  one of those small little motorized cars. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=391.62s)]
*  Books, his books, his children's books are all over the floor. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=394.09999999999997s)]
*  You have your papers all over the desk. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=397.73999999999995s)]
*  And I looked at that picture and I said, this is a working mom's life. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=401.28s)]
*  We can all relate to this. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=405.14s)]
*  Everything's chaotic. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=407.09999999999997s)]
*  Everything's hectic, but it's so much fun. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=408.26s)]
*  And everyone tells us to enjoy those moments because they're fleeting. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=410.34s)]
*  And your kids grow up and it just flies by. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=413.78s)]
*  When you look at that picture, what was happening in that moment? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=416.73999999999995s)]
*  When I see it, that was the time that I did QVC collection, my jewelry and timepieces. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=420.38s)]
*  Which sold out in 45 minutes. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=426.73999999999995s)]
*  It did, yes. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=428.46s)]
*  It was very successful. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=429.46s)]
*  So I was doing all at the same time, working, playing with Baron. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=431.28s)]
*  He has his own time with his car and his books and we talking. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=436.58s)]
*  So I think it's very important that we show our children that we are working too, to give [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=443.16s)]
*  them an example how life is, that they see us, that we are productive, that we have an [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=449.88000000000005s)]
*  idea as that idea comes to life. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=456.56s)]
*  And that's how we're showing Baron. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=460.04s)]
*  And did you and Donald Trump, did you ever talk about having more children? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=463.32000000000005s)]
*  Did you want a larger family? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=466.8s)]
*  I was always perfectly fine with one. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=468.6s)]
*  And Donald was encouraging to have more. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=474.2s)]
*  And I said, like, I'm completely fine with one because it's very busy life. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=478.68s)]
*  And I know how busy he is. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=485.62s)]
*  And I'm in charge of everything. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=488.44s)]
*  So that's why it's just perfect. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=491.28s)]
*  So Donald was on Brian Kilmeade's show last weekend and Brian was asking you about your [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  relationship and he said, you know, Brian, she really, really does love me. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=501.47999999999996s)]
*  So what do you love most about your husband? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=507.44s)]
*  His being, his humor, his personality, his kindness. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=509.91999999999996s)]
*  He's very special. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=519.24s)]
*  His positivity, his energy, it's unbelievable. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=521.76s)]
*  Yeah, so we have a beautiful relationship. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=527.28s)]
*  We see these clips of Donald Trump giving a lady at the cash register $100 to pay for [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=531.24s)]
*  her groceries. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=536.56s)]
*  The little boy with a rare disease, he invites him to the rally in New York and the little [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=537.56s)]
*  boy cries when he receives a letter on his birthday from Donald Trump. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=541.92s)]
*  Donald Trump called all of, he calls all the service members, their family members when [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=545.28s)]
*  they lose their lives. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=550.88s)]
*  These are stories that a lot of people, you're not going to see this on other networks. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=552.56s)]
*  Is that the man he is? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=556.0999999999999s)]
*  That's the man he is, yes. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=557.56s)]
*  One word to describe him, what would that be? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=559.92s)]
*  One or two words? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=561.88s)]
*  Caring, caring, especially for this country. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=564.64s)]
*  And what are the two of you like to do for fun if you're not working? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=570.8s)]
*  To have dinner, sometimes quiet dinner or dinner with friends and listen to the music, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=574.64s)]
*  all kind of different musics. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=580.9200000000001s)]
*  I hear he likes to be the DJ. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=583.4s)]
*  He likes to be the DJ and it's a very fun night when he does that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=585.32s)]
*  When you marry Donald Trump, he already had four children and you talk about that in the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=592.72s)]
*  book and it would seem so fun to have just so much life and children around you. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=596.2s)]
*  You said, I gave everyone their own space, grounded in love and respect. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=600.8s)]
*  You didn't always agree, but acknowledged differing viewpoints. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=605.28s)]
*  So what advice do you have for blended families? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=609.3199999999999s)]
*  To take individual as they are. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=612.78s)]
*  You cannot control anyone. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=616.04s)]
*  You could control only your own behavior, your own words. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=618.12s)]
*  Everybody's in control of own self. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=623.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm not in control of my husband. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=627.52s)]
*  I'm not in control of his children. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=629.5s)]
*  I'm not even in control of my child. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=631.98s)]
*  He's his own person. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=634.98s)]
*  And we all have yes and nos and we are all individuals. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=637.58s)]
*  Once you lead your life with respect and love, that's all what matters. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=642.98s)]
*  Barron now, he's so handsome and we've enjoyed watching him grow up. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=650.86s)]
*  I'm very proud of you for keeping his life private. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=654.7s)]
*  I think that's important. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=656.94s)]
*  Barron is now in college. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=659.78s)]
*  What was that like for you? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=660.78s)]
*  What's advice? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=661.78s)]
*  What advice can you give all of us who are a little nervous about that day because we [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=662.78s)]
*  just love our children so much? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=666.06s)]
*  What's it like being an empty nester? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=667.86s)]
*  I could not say I'm an empty nester. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=670.14s)]
*  I don't feel that way. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=672.3s)]
*  I raised Barron as our own person and gave him his own yes and nos. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=674.54s)]
*  I respect that. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=682.58s)]
*  It was his decision to come here, that he wants to be in New York and study in New York [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=684.98s)]
*  and live in his home. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=690.6600000000001s)]
*  And I respect that. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=693.7s)]
*  And he's an incredible young man. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=696.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm very proud of what he grew up to. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=701.58s)]
*  His strength, his intelligence, his knowledge, his kindness, it's admirable. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=707.38s)]
*  And he's enjoying his college days. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=716.02s)]
*  I hope he will have a great experience because his life is very different than any other [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=720.06s)]
*  18, 19-year-old child. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=726.02s)]
*  I was moved to tears in your book when I read about the loss of your mother. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=728.5s)]
*  And you said this about her loss. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=732.98s)]
*  There is an unparalleled sorrow in losing a mother, a profound heartache that shatters [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=735.42s)]
*  the spirit into fragments. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=740.62s)]
*  For me, this heartache feels insurmountable. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=743.78s)]
*  And the weight of grief is overwhelming. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=748.42s)]
*  It does feel insurmountable sometimes. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=751.86s)]
*  And let me be strong. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=755.5799999999999s)]
*  But how do we, what advice do you have? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=757.3399999999999s)]
*  Because I remember when my mom lost my grandmother, it was devastating. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=759.9399999999999s)]
*  And it really separated her from God for a while. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=763.98s)]
*  She came back to God. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=766.46s)]
*  She just had a lot of questions because she felt like he took someone that was so special [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=768.5s)]
*  to her away from all of us. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=772.74s)]
*  But it made my faith stronger. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=774.5s)]
*  But what advice do you have for people that are going through this to lose a parent? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=776.94s)]
*  Well, it's a very, a moment that nobody prepares you. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=781.6600000000001s)]
*  And it's a grief that comes in waves. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=790.4200000000001s)]
*  And you need to feel it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=793.1s)]
*  You need to have that inner peace that to go with it, to feel it, to experience it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=795.9000000000001s)]
*  And first of all, I want to thank all of the people around the world who sent beautiful [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=804.0200000000001s)]
*  letters, beautiful prayers, very kind notes. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=812.0200000000001s)]
*  Thank you to everybody who wrote me, who thought about me and my family and was really [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=818.7s)]
*  deeply appreciated. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=828.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=829.1s)]
*  And I know she lives on in Barron. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=830.1s)]
*  I remember at her funeral, Donald Trump talked about how your mom would cook for him. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=833.26s)]
*  And that's probably why Barron is so tall. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=839.0600000000001s)]
*  She was very special woman, full of warmth, kindness, and also strength. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=841.3000000000001s)]
*  Her life was incredible in Slovenia. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=848.02s)]
*  She established a life for myself and for my sister. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=852.1800000000001s)]
*  Incredible life, also my father. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=860.02s)]
*  But her strength was admirable. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=863.66s)]
*  And once Barron was born, he was her focus. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=867.7s)]
*  She moved here to the United States to be close to him and to raise him in one way. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=874.74s)]
*  It's almost like she was a second mother, especially because of my schedule in the White [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=882.78s)]
*  House and being so busy. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=887.9s)]
*  And they had an incredible bond. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=891.82s)]
*  Her and Barron, it was a relationship like no other. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=895.1s)]
*  to catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NtrG0YS_88&t=904.74s)]
