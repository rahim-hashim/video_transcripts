# 'BLINKED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS': Ex-detective predicts when CEO's killer could be handcuffed
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY)
*  Fox News alert the FBI stepping into help with a nationwide manhunt for the suspected killer who gunned down the CEO of United Health Care. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=0.0s)]
*  Police now examining new evidence including what they believe is the killer's backpack as seen in this photo obtained by the New York Post. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=10.36s)]
*  This all while hinting at what the killer's motive might be. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=17.86s)]
*  Not going to commit to a motive right now but you know obviously when you look at the writing you look at the victims employment it you know it could possibly be a disgruntled employee or a disgruntled client but we're not we're not ruling that out but we're certainly not committing to it at this time. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=22.9s)]
*  Former NYPD Lieutenant and U.S. Army veteran Dr. Darren Porcher joins us now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=36.66s)]
*  Darren great to see you this morning. So you're seeing this evidence sort of trickle out for the public the backpack the suspected exit route to the bus station perhaps to Atlanta. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=42.419999999999995s)]
*  Do you think authorities right now know much more perhaps are zeroing in on a guy that we're still wondering about. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=55.059999999999995s)]
*  Do you think they're much closer to catching this guy than perhaps we might know. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=62.5s)]
*  Well good morning well and good morning to the viewers and I believe that police have far more information that they're revealing to the public. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=66.14s)]
*  I think that when we look at this backpack for example based on the puffiness is clear that is populated with items and what's going to happen is the NYPD is going to transport that backpack to their crime scene lab in Jamaica Queens to conduct a forensic investigation on the items that are contained in that backpack. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=73.7s)]
*  Because those items can be germane in establishing an ID for who the individual in question would be. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=95.62s)]
*  I think that we have more than more than enough at this point in time because the killer has blinked on several occasions. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=102.66s)]
*  And so I just think it's a matter of days or even hours before we have a capture of this violent individual that killed the CEO of United Health Care on the streets of New York. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=110.66s)]
*  Before we move on you said you think there are several instances of the killer quote unquote blinking by blinking I assume you mean making some mistakes in this entire process that would would help law enforcement besides the backpack. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=122.30000000000001s)]
*  What do you point to as other examples of the killer blinking. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=135.02s)]
*  When we look at the killer at the hostel he revealed his face when he pulled his mask down and how that's important is you're able to triangulate the eyes the nose and the mouth for facial recognition. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=138.34s)]
*  And that's going to be significant in trying to establish who this individual is and also presenting this information to the public because now we have a chance of a friend or someone else that would have saw this video or I should say still photo and say wow I know that it's this person. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=153.74s)]
*  Therefore they'll call police to assist in trying to apprehend this individual. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  All right I want to move to another legal case here in New York City this one already in the jury deliberation process we've already found the case at least Alvin Bragg and his prosecutor's office believe they found the case to pursue. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=176.7s)]
*  And that's Daniel Penny which on Friday the second degree manslaughter charges were dismissed but the jury was sent back to deliberate over criminally negligent homicide setting aside the process of the judge. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=188.5s)]
*  You know pushing the jury to find a verdict on one of these charges. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=204.5s)]
*  Do you think they have there what it takes to come back with a guilty verdict on the standard of criminally negligent homicide. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=208.22s)]
*  Well first off well I think that this is a miscarriage of justice in that once the prosecution determined that there was the jury was hung on a charge of manslaughter then they elected to go with the lower charge. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=217.26000000000002s)]
*  This should have been thrown out at this stage. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  Once you see that you lost throughout the trial proceedings I think it's clear that you should have just stepped away from it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=233.38s)]
*  But this is not what Alvin Bragg intended to do. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=240.46s)]
*  I think his intention was to prosecute Daniel Penny by any means necessary. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=244.3s)]
*  And Daniel Penny is an American hero because he stepped up to assist people that didn't have the ability to protect themselves on that subway car. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=249.42000000000002s)]
*  So when we look to the process that's happening it's now become something more as how can we catch and convict Daniel Penny as best as possible as opposed to letting the league. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=258.53999999999996s)]
*  I think we lost a connection there a little bit with Dr. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=272.41999999999996s)]
*  Darren Portser but we got much of the information we hope to get with him this morning. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=274.38s)]
*  We appreciate Dr. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=278.17999999999995s)]
*  Darren Portser. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=279.82s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=280.7s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iu-pcc3VvY&t=281.58s)]
