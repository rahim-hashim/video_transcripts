# Zuckerberg's admission is a 'victory' for free speech: Lee
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU)
*  All right, Fox News alert this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=0.0s)]
*  Met a CEO Mark Zuckerberg feeling bad. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=3.1s)]
*  Yeah, feeling bad for caving to the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=5.74s)]
*  Biden Harris White House, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=7.7s)]
*  who he admits pressured him and his [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=8.78s)]
*  company into censoring COVID content. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=10.74s)]
*  Zuckerberg writing quote in 2021 [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=12.94s)]
*  senior officials at the Biden [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=14.72s)]
*  administration, including those from [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=16.52s)]
*  the White House repeatedly pressured [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=17.86s)]
*  our teams for months to censor certain [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=19.7s)]
*  COVID-19 related content, including humor, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=22.2s)]
*  satire and expressed significant frustration. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=24.42s)]
*  When we did not meet their demands, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=27.0s)]
*  I believe the government pressure was [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=28.66s)]
*  wrong and I regret that we were not [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=30.58s)]
*  more outspoken about it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=32.9s)]
*  GOP Congresswoman Laurel Lee sits [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=34.06s)]
*  on the House Judiciary Committee, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=35.68s)]
*  and this is a big moment for her. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=37.5s)]
*  What do you take from this? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  This this confession. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=42.42s)]
*  Well, first and foremost, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=45.900000000000006s)]
*  this is a great victory for the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  First Amendment for Mr Zuckerberg [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=49.5s)]
*  to come out and acknowledge that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=51.1s)]
*  information was suppressed about COVID. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=53.3s)]
*  Everything when we saw President Trump [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=55.379999999999995s)]
*  and people like Governor DeSantis [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=57.42s)]
*  trying to share information with the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=59.300000000000004s)]
*  public about the efficacy of therapeutics, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  about lockdowns and whether they were working. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=63.86s)]
*  You know, at the time they were vilified [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=66.34s)]
*  and information from people who [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=68.98s)]
*  had opinions was suppressed. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=70.72s)]
*  And to see Mr Zuckerberg acknowledging [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=72.38s)]
*  this is really important. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  It shows the links that the Biden [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=75.9s)]
*  administration went to try to shut [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=78.18s)]
*  this information down and the other [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=80.18s)]
*  thing that he mentions in this letter [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=82.18s)]
*  that's really critical is an [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=84.42s)]
*  acknowledgement that the Hunter [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=86.22s)]
*  Biden laptop story was suppressed, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=87.82s)]
*  and that's something that we have [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=89.58s)]
*  spent so much time in judiciary [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=91.42s)]
*  working on and trying to bring to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=93.38s)]
*  light is that we have 51 intelligence [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=95.52s)]
*  officers basically locked to the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=97.7s)]
*  American people and try to cast this [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=99.38s)]
*  as Russian disinformation when it wasn't. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=101.46s)]
*  And that information was suppressed [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  in the lead up to the election, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=104.98s)]
*  so it's very important for us to be [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=107.06s)]
*  able to show you know these are the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=109.18s)]
*  real facts of what was going on then, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=111.5s)]
*  and the links to which this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=113.86s)]
*  information is going to try to hold [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=115.74s)]
*  back this information from the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=117.94s)]
*  American people. But remember, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=119.58s)]
*  when the laptop was out there, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=120.82s)]
*  President Trump was president, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=122.58s)]
*  so somehow the challenging party [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  had more sway with our the FBI [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=125.58s)]
*  and other agencies than the one [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=127.74s)]
*  in power, which is bizarre. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=129.66s)]
*  Meanwhile, the White House just [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=131.29999999999998s)]
*  given us this statement on this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=132.78s)]
*  When confronted with a deadly pandemic, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=134.7s)]
*  this administration encouraged [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=136.7s)]
*  responsible actions to protect [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=137.85999999999999s)]
*  public health and safety in Europe, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=139.34s)]
*  and our position has been clear and consistent. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=141.26s)]
*  I believe tech companies and our [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=143.9s)]
*  private actors should take into account [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=145.86s)]
*  their effects their actions have on [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=147.94s)]
*  the American people while making [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=149.94s)]
*  independent choices about the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=151.86s)]
*  information they present. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  So if you bring up something like [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  Ivermectin that's been irresponsible, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=156.22s)]
*  in whose eyes in a in some officials [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=157.78s)]
*  eyes in other people's eyes it didn't. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=160.26s)]
*  That's the big question. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=162.82s)]
*  If you went against what they thought [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  was right, then you're wrong until [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=166.46s)]
*  further notice. That's a bad precedent. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=168.66s)]
*  It absolutely is. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=171.70000000000002s)]
*  And the whole idea of the First Amendment [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=173.14s)]
*  is that it allows us to express [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  contrary ideas to bring those out [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=177.34s)]
*  into the public square and let the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=179.46s)]
*  public get to the bottom of what's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=181.1s)]
*  the correct information. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=182.7s)]
*  And what's worse, history tells [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=183.98s)]
*  this story and we now know what [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=186.14s)]
*  the data shows us about the fact [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  that there were effective therapeutics. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=190.01999999999998s)]
*  The fact that it was appropriate [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=192.26s)]
*  to be prioritizing seniors [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=194.01999999999998s)]
*  in the vulnerable. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=195.62s)]
*  So, you know, not only was it [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=196.46s)]
*  wrong for them to try to suppress [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=198.66s)]
*  opposing viewpoints, the actual data [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=201.14s)]
*  that we now have related to the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=204.29999999999998s)]
*  pandemic demonstrates that these [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=206.05999999999997s)]
*  positions they were suppressing, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=208.1s)]
*  that many of them were actually correct [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  and that the public would have [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=211.77999999999997s)]
*  benefited from having them out there [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=212.82s)]
*  and getting the option to make [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=214.77999999999997s)]
*  their own choices. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=216.01999999999998s)]
*  And now we know a lot of the so [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=217.26s)]
*  called facts were wrong. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=218.42s)]
*  Yesterday you went over to Butler, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=219.85999999999999s)]
*  Pennsylvania, because you're a member [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=221.06s)]
*  of the task force investigating [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=222.14s)]
*  the assassination attempt. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=223.33999999999997s)]
*  Then that is the site of the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=225.33999999999997s)]
*  assassination attempt on Donald Trump. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=226.66s)]
*  You haven't received everything [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=229.73999999999998s)]
*  you've requested. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=230.98s)]
*  The whole committee hasn't. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=231.78s)]
*  They've requested the documents [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=232.73999999999998s)]
*  from the DHS, from the FBI and others. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=234.14s)]
*  So what was your takeaway from what [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=236.98s)]
*  you saw physically there and from [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=239.7s)]
*  what you expected to see? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=241.54s)]
*  One of the really key things about [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=244.54s)]
*  going to the site and seeing it is [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=246.5s)]
*  that you get the sense of exactly [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=248.33999999999997s)]
*  how small it is. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=250.62s)]
*  This is not a large area. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=251.89999999999998s)]
*  It's very rural. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=253.5s)]
*  Even as a lay person, it's clear [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=255.06s)]
*  what the buildings are, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=257.42s)]
*  what's in the area and what needs [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=258.62s)]
*  to be secured. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=260.22s)]
*  So it really underscores just how [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=261.26000000000005s)]
*  inexplicable this catastrophic [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=263.42s)]
*  security failure was that this was [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=265.14000000000004s)]
*  allowed to happen. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=267.78000000000003s)]
*  The other thing that is clear is that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=268.90000000000003s)]
*  there were serious communication [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=271.3s)]
*  and coordination problems. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=273.18s)]
*  State and local law enforcement [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=274.94000000000005s)]
*  are a big part of securing a site [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=276.66s)]
*  like this, of securing a rally. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=279.18s)]
*  But it is evident from the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=281.18s)]
*  investigation that we've been [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=282.82000000000005s)]
*  conducting already that there was [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=283.82000000000005s)]
*  a lack of communication and a lack [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  of coordination. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=287.18s)]
*  So one of the things we want to be [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=288.06s)]
*  sure we do is understand how that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=289.62s)]
*  fell apart because that's a key [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  element to ensuring that this [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=294.42s)]
*  doesn't happen for future rallies [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=295.7s)]
*  while these protectees are still [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=297.86s)]
*  out on the trail. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=298.98s)]
*  Congresswoman, we're over time, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=299.58s)]
*  but we know nothing about the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=300.7s)]
*  assassin. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=302.3s)]
*  Why do they have to quickly [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=303.42s)]
*  cremate the body? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=304.54s)]
*  We don't know how he made the IEDs. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=305.66s)]
*  They say intelligence experts say [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=307.9s)]
*  they still haven't unencrypted his [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=310.18s)]
*  tech devices. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=314.02s)]
*  Well, that's and that is the key [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=316.62s)]
*  information that is missing that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=318.58000000000004s)]
*  we're still needing to develop from [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=321.3s)]
*  the FBI, from Secret Service, is [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=323.86s)]
*  who was this kid? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=326.46000000000004s)]
*  What was his motivation? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=327.70000000000005s)]
*  Did he work alone? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=329.54s)]
*  Did he work with someone else? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=330.86s)]
*  That's what we're still missing as [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=332.66s)]
*  we're trying to pull information [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=334.02000000000004s)]
*  from that phone. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=335.26s)]
*  So in the coming weeks, that will [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=335.94s)]
*  be one of the key focuses of the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=337.70000000000005s)]
*  committee. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=339.02000000000004s)]
*  I wish people were more curious [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=339.46000000000004s)]
*  like you guys are. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=341.06s)]
*  Congresswoman, thanks so much. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bya_AHxMltU&t=341.78000000000003s)]
