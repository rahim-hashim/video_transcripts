# Vivek Ramaswamy: Trump is on a mission to save a country
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk)
*  So former president Donald Trump landed all out and landed all out on the line saying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=0.0s)]
*  this is his last effort to take back the White House watch. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=5.9s)]
*  If you're not successful this time, do you see yourself running again in four years? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=9.86s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=13.9s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=15.5s)]
*  I think that that will be, that will be it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=16.5s)]
*  I don't see that at all. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=19.22s)]
*  I think that hopefully we're going to be successful. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=20.22s)]
*  So this is it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=23.06s)]
*  The brand new polls spell some good news for the former president, taking the lead in key [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  sun-belt states. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=28.6s)]
*  And voters say they trust him to handle the top issues of the economy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=29.6s)]
*  As both candidates plan to address the economy this week, former presidential candidate and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=33.28s)]
*  Trump's surrogate Vivek Ramaswamy joins us now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=36.8s)]
*  So Vivek, what do you think about that the former president said this is it? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=39.6s)]
*  Either I'm going to take back the White House, return to the Trump economy, secure border, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=43.32s)]
*  or I'm never doing this again. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  Well, look, I think that he's planning on winning, which is where he's coming from when [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  he's saying that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=52.6s)]
*  But the reality is why would someone want to put themselves through that an additional [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=53.6s)]
*  time? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=57.04s)]
*  I mean, I say this as someone who's run myself, President Trump, what he's been through this [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=58.58s)]
*  year in particular has been on another level. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=62.26s)]
*  You do this if you're on a mission to save a country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=64.98s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=67.58s)]
*  I think that he's got his laser eyes focused on achieving that in about 50 days. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=68.58s)]
*  So let's look at some of the issues right here when it comes to inflation, who people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=72.3s)]
*  trust. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=75.34s)]
*  40 percent say here's 48 percent Trump. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=76.34s)]
*  And I guess that's my big question. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=80.06s)]
*  When you look at all of the issues, whether it's the economy, the border, international [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=82.25999999999999s)]
*  affairs, who they trust, Donald Trump completely destroys her. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=86.08s)]
*  But then when you look at the national polling, you look at the state of the state, it becomes [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=91.92s)]
*  much closer. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=96.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=97.0s)]
*  What's the difference between facts and narratives? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=98.0s)]
*  People know the facts of what it looked like when they were under Donald Trump. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=100.16s)]
*  Prices were flat, wages went up. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=103.4s)]
*  We were out of World War III, nowhere close to it, and we had a secure border. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=105.56s)]
*  Now we have the most open border we've had in our history of our country. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  We're closer to major conflict than we have any time in our lifetime. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is that the economy is stagnant. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=116.58000000000001s)]
*  You got prices that have gone up and wages that have remained flat. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=119.04s)]
*  Those are the facts. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=122.14000000000001s)]
*  However, the narrative around this served up through much of the media is that we're [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=123.14000000000001s)]
*  still a nation somehow in despair because of Donald Trump, even though it's been Joe [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  Biden and Kamala Harris in office. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=131.46s)]
*  I also think, Lawrence, people are hungry for something deeper as well. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=133.02s)]
*  Inspiration, identity, pride in our country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=136.74s)]
*  And I do think when Donald Trump is at his best, he's been the best president we've [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=139.96s)]
*  had this century who's able to fill that gap of pride, which isn't something that shows [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=143.16s)]
*  up in issue surveys amongst voters. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  But I do think is a deeper issue that matters to Americans is reviving our sense of identity [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=150.68s)]
*  as Americans. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=156.36s)]
*  Answer, who are we? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=157.36s)]
*  And I think if Donald Trump is able to channel that between now and the finish line, as I've [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=158.92s)]
*  seen him do when he's at his best, I think that's really what's going to carry us, not [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=162.2s)]
*  only over election day, but in reviving our country afterwards. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=166.16s)]
*  So let's talk about your new book, The Truths, available now for preorder now. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=169.18s)]
*  It also pairs very well with your Fox Nation special as well. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=172.62s)]
*  Tell me about the book. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=176.14000000000001s)]
*  So the thesis of this book is that the way we're going to get our country back is through [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  free speech and open dialogue. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  So what I try to do here is arm right-of-center Americans with the arguments they can bring [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=182.70000000000002s)]
*  to the dinner table with their friends. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=187.78s)]
*  And yes, I did say friends at the dinner table, friends and family members who might be on [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=190.10000000000002s)]
*  on issues ranging from the open borders to the transgender debate, to the climate change [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  debate. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  One of the things that we've seen is a culture of fear that's spread across the country, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  that if you don't say things quite the right way, you may be at risk of being canceled [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=205.16000000000003s)]
*  or losing your job or your kids getting a bad grade in school. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=208.72s)]
*  So this book is about arming people with hard facts, simple arguments that you can bring [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=212.52s)]
*  to that dinner table. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=216.88s)]
*  And one of the things I found when I ran for president is that we're not really as divided [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=218.56s)]
*  as the media would actually teach us to believe. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=223.26000000000002s)]
*  I think 80 plus percent of us in this country share the same values set in common. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=225.42000000000002s)]
*  And so this book is about calling that bluff, saying the way we're going to discover that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=231.02s)]
*  is all of us starting to talk in the open again. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=235.06s)]
*  I want to tell you this is my fourth book in the last four years. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=237.74s)]
*  I think it's my most important one. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=240.46s)]
*  If people are able to speak the truth, that's how we get our country back. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  And so I wrote the book. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=245.62s)]
*  So you talk about talking with people. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=246.62s)]
*  This is your Fox Nation special, and you're doing that as well. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=248.34s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=250.98000000000002s)]
*  Bureaucracy is also antithetical to merit, I believe. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=253.26000000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=257.06s)]
*  Steve, do you believe during your time in government the best person got the highest [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=258.06s)]
*  ranking job? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=262.90000000000003s)]
*  How well do you think that worked? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=263.90000000000003s)]
*  Without talking about particular individuals, the political appointments in the government, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=265.74s)]
*  the leadership appointments, are just that, political. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=271.34000000000003s)]
*  And it's very difficult to say that you always make the best choice on the basis of absolute merit. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=274.78000000000003s)]
*  It's a powerful special, Vivek. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=281.08s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining the program today. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  We also reached out to the Harris Walls campaign, but we didn't hear back from them. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=284.56s)]
*  But if you want more Vivek, you can go see him on Fox Nation. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=288.08s)]
*  Well, send him a copy of the book. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoqKhH8L8uk&t=291.52s)]
