# Melania Trump sits down for exclusive interview: 'I want to put the record straight'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ)
*  All right, in a Fox and Friends exclusive, Melania Trump is setting the record straight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=0.0s)]
*  on her life, her family, and the election that's coming up. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=5.04s)]
*  She lays it all out in her new memoir called Melania, set to hit the shelves next month. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=9.14s)]
*  So we were able to sit down with the former first lady for this exclusive interview, her [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=14.02s)]
*  first in more than two years. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=18.94s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=21.34s)]
*  Why did you want to tell your story in this book? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=23.14s)]
*  I believe that it was the time that I tell my story and the truth. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=26.0s)]
*  It is a lot of misinformation and falsehoods written about me, and I want to put the record [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  straight and people can learn some things that they were never discussed. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=43.92s)]
*  And I hope they enjoy the book. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  How did you feel about Donald Trump running again? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=54.48s)]
*  I support him. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  I know how passionate he is to make America great again. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=58.72s)]
*  We saw you backstage at the RNC. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=63.4s)]
*  Do you want to talk about why you decided not to come out on stage and give a speech [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=66.28s)]
*  like you did in 2016? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=70.2s)]
*  It was my decision. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=72.92s)]
*  I think it was just the time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=73.92s)]
*  I think was the right time in a days before I wrote a beautiful letter to America. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=75.68s)]
*  And I think in one way that letter was my speech. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=86.04s)]
*  The raid on Mar-a-Lago, the house manager texts you and says the FBI is outside the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  house. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=94.72s)]
*  They had access to my bedroom, closets, office and rummage through my personal items. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  Ever even searched Baron's room, you say. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=102.4s)]
*  So how invasive was that? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=105.64s)]
*  Did it make you angry? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=107.36s)]
*  How did you feel? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=108.56s)]
*  Yeah, it made me angry. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=109.56s)]
*  Yes, invasion of privacy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=111.28s)]
*  And the way it was done was I was really surprised. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=114.72s)]
*  And you told your house manager, just leave it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=121.36s)]
*  Don't touch anything. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=124.48s)]
*  Don't put it back. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=125.48s)]
*  You wanted to see it for your own eyes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=126.48s)]
*  With your own eyes. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=128.6s)]
*  What did it look like when you walked back in your house that had been raided? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=129.6s)]
*  I saw unpleasant stuff that nobody wants to see it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=135.08s)]
*  And you get angry because, you know, nobody should be putting up with that kind of stuff. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  Some person, I don't even know who or how many people they, you know, they went through [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=148.4s)]
*  my stuff. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  So the assassination attempts, the first one is in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  And you write about watching the assassination attempt on TV and you started working and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=159.16s)]
*  you were distracted. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=165.28s)]
*  So you pushed pause. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=166.28s)]
*  I think your chief of staff maybe called you and said, he's OK, but there's been a shooting. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=167.28s)]
*  What happened next? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=173.12s)]
*  I ran to the TV and I rewind it and I watched it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=178.0s)]
*  I was only a few minutes behind and something, I guess, looked over me. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  So I didn't really see live, live, but maybe, you know, three minutes, few minutes later. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=192.0s)]
*  But when I saw it, I, you know, it was only nobody really knew yet, because when you see [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=198.4s)]
*  him on the floor and you don't know, you don't know what really happened. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=205.6s)]
*  So you called him and he didn't answer his phone and you called Secret Service. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=213.56s)]
*  And what did they say? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  First, the Secret Service was not available to because they were with him. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=223.72s)]
*  And then after that, I got the Secret Service on the phone and they said that he's OK. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=224.72s)]
*  We are on the way to the hospital. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=232.28s)]
*  He will be OK. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=235.48s)]
*  And were you able to talk to him on the phone? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=236.72s)]
*  Yes, I did. I did. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=238.52s)]
*  And then your son rushes into the room and he had been told your son is in college. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=239.84s)]
*  I understand. But he's still your child. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=246.56s)]
*  This is his father. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=249.88s)]
*  How difficult was that to have that conversation? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=251.56s)]
*  Very difficult, very difficult. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=254.48s)]
*  He was outside playing sport and he rushed in. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=256.92s)]
*  And it was very, very difficult. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=262.8s)]
*  And then a few weeks later, there's another attempt on your husband's life at your golf [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=266.44s)]
*  course. Where were you and what was your reaction to this attempt? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=270.8s)]
*  I was in New York City, actually, and I saw it on the television. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=275.28s)]
*  And as soon as I saw it on television, I called again. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=283.36s)]
*  And he was OK because Secret Service were great. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=288.76000000000005s)]
*  The guys that they were with him, they were fantastic. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think both of the events, they were really a miracle. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=297.48s)]
*  If you really think about it, July 13 was a miracle, like that much. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  And he could, you know, he could not be with us. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=312.32000000000005s)]
*  And he normally doesn't call for that one screen. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=315.84s)]
*  He waits till the end of the speech. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=319.47999999999996s)]
*  So just looking at that screen allowed him to turn his head. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=321.52s)]
*  And he said it was providential. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=325.44s)]
*  Did you does this make you believe in it more, in a higher power? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=327.08s)]
*  How has that been for you? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=331.79999999999995s)]
*  I think something was watching over him. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  I think he's it's almost like country really needs him. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=337.08s)]
*  That maybe God's sparing his life. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=342.91999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=344.48s)]
*  And then we were told this week and we were told that authorities have already known [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=346.36s)]
*  this for a while, that there was an Iranian plot to kill your husband. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=352.32s)]
*  So I watched this video that you released on social media questioning the first [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=357.88s)]
*  assassination attempt for the second one, if they knew that there was this plot, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=364.2s)]
*  why didn't they sweep the golf course? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=367.76s)]
*  You know, it's interesting how quiet and. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=369.88000000000005s)]
*  Everything became all of the mainstream media. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=376.92s)]
*  There were a few days reporting about July 13 event and everything then became quiet. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=381.36s)]
*  So I had a lot of questions. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=392.12s)]
*  It's this is not normal. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=393.56s)]
*  And. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=395.6s)]
*  Is it really shocking that all this egregious violence? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=398.08s)]
*  Goes against my husband, especially that we hear the leaders from the opposition [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=408.16s)]
*  party and mainstream media branding him as a threat to democracy, calling him violent. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=415.56s)]
*  Calling him vile names. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=424.68s)]
*  They only fueling a toxic atmosphere and giving power all of these people that they [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=427.40000000000003s)]
*  want to do harm to him. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=434.36s)]
*  This needs to stop. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=436.24s)]
*  This needs to stop. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=438.08s)]
*  The country needs to unite. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=439.08s)]
*  And I encourage everybody to read my letter that I wrote on July 14 again, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=441.2s)]
*  because that cannot continue. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=449.8s)]
*  Letter was very powerful. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=452.72s)]
*  What made you get to the point of writing that letter? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=453.96s)]
*  That's how I felt. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=456.88s)]
*  That's how I felt. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=458.76s)]
*  How do you feel when people say they don't like him? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  What do you wish they knew about him? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=463.76s)]
*  That he's really a family man. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=467.44s)]
*  He loves his family. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=470.96s)]
*  He loves this country and all he wants to build, build better and prosperous. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=472.44s)]
*  Yeah, he's just strong. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=482.03999999999996s)]
*  He's not afraid to talk about the way it really is. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=483.04s)]
*  You could see the way he was when he was shot, that in the ear, that the way he stood up [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=486.44s)]
*  and he said, fight, fight, fight, because we cannot allow that to happen. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=492.36s)]
*  OK, becoming first lady. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=498.92s)]
*  You wrote in the book when you found out you were watching Fox News right here in Trump [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=500.84s)]
*  Tower and you write, I vividly recall Brett Baer's announcement. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=506.16s)]
*  The president elect is Donald J. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=510.40000000000003s)]
*  Trump. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=513.72s)]
*  And he looked at you and he said, can you believe it? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=514.88s)]
*  And you said, yes, I can. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=518.08s)]
*  Your life immediately changed. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=520.24s)]
*  When did it hit you? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=522.08s)]
*  I am the first lady of the United States. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=523.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't know that it hits you, but you. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=528.12s)]
*  You know that you have extra, extra responsibility. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=533.6s)]
*  You talked about having special bonds with first ladies, with the wives of prime ministers, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=537.68s)]
*  who really did when you were just there with them and you had to sit at the dinner table [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=542.2399999999999s)]
*  and talk, I'm sure some were just incredibly fine. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=545.9599999999999s)]
*  You really bonded with a few of them. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=548.76s)]
*  Anyone come to mind? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=551.56s)]
*  It's interesting because when you meet many times, you establish a relationship. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=553.56s)]
*  So with Mrs. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=561.0s)]
*  McCrone, Brigitte McCrone, she's fine. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=562.56s)]
*  She's fine. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=565.1999999999999s)]
*  We always had the great laughs and with Aki, Mrs. Abe. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=566.08s)]
*  And I'm so sorry what happened to him. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=573.12s)]
*  So it was very special relationships with, you know, with each of them. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=577.64s)]
*  You've also traveled to visit our soldiers. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=583.88s)]
*  You did that at Christmas time. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=587.84s)]
*  You left your family. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=589.36s)]
*  It was in the dead of night. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  And you fly over to Iraq to bless the troops. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=592.4000000000001s)]
*  What was that like for you and what about the reaction from the troops? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=594.92s)]
*  It was very secretive meeting. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=599.52s)]
*  And when we arrived that night, the energy of the soldiers, we walked in and everybody [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=601.8399999999999s)]
*  started cheering that they see us. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=614.12s)]
*  Like, what a big surprise. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=617.0s)]
*  They were not expecting that. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=618.5999999999999s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=619.92s)]
*  So what makes you, what makes Donald Trump want to do this again? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=620.8399999999999s)]
*  All he wants to, as he says, make America great again. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=624.52s)]
*  He wants to make this country prosperous, safe for everybody. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=630.12s)]
*  He wants to make American dream possible again. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=635.4s)]
*  What was your reaction to Kamala Harris replacing Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=640.48s)]
*  Well, how I see it is the records speaks for itself. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=646.08s)]
*  The country is suffering. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=652.64s)]
*  People are not able to buy usual necessities for the families. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=655.76s)]
*  We have wars going on around the world. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=665.76s)]
*  Soldiers are dying. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=669.88s)]
*  They were dying under this administration because of weak leadership. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=672.4s)]
*  The border is open and dangerous. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=678.2s)]
*  A lot of fentanyl is coming over, killing our youth. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=680.9200000000001s)]
*  It's very hard to see. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=687.6400000000001s)]
*  And an economy, it's really not great. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=690.32s)]
*  Inflation is high. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=695.8000000000001s)]
*  And if we compare these four years under this administration compared to four years under [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=698.2800000000001s)]
*  my husband as commander in chief, he was. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=705.5200000000001s)]
*  Leading the country through. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=710.44s)]
*  Peace, through strength and the border was safer than ever before. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=715.96s)]
*  We didn't have any wars. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=722.96s)]
*  People were prospering. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=724.8000000000001s)]
*  They had jobs. They they could support their families. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=726.6s)]
*  So I think American people need to decide what they really want. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=731.24s)]
*  I think maybe some, you know, strong tweets, but everything else great for this country. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=736.8s)]
*  So it's all in the Americans people's hands on November 5th. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=748.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, she's right. I mean, she just wrapped up essentially what the election is about. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=753.8s)]
*  She went from the economy to world peace to the border. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=759.68s)]
*  And she said there may have been some rough tweets, but what do you want? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=765.4s)]
*  Do you want is that enough for you versus a strong economy and all that? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=770.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's a campaign that right there. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=775.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, the thing is for people to think that she's detached to her own thing. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=777.24s)]
*  She looks like she's watching the speeches. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=780.7199999999999s)]
*  And when you said that during the assassination, she had to leave the room. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=782.68s)]
*  So she paused the speech. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=786.3199999999999s)]
*  I'll think about that. Just a Saturday afternoon speech. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=787.7199999999999s)]
*  Important enough for her to I don't want to miss it. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=790.12s)]
*  I'm going to go pause it and then came back and her husband was shot. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=793.0s)]
*  So all those people out there think she's detached and the relationship is fractured. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=796.2s)]
*  I don't think you're paying attention. Right. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=800.72s)]
*  Well, you know, we haven't seen her talk. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=803.36s)]
*  She hadn't done an interview for two years. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=806.16s)]
*  There are, you know, a lot of dots we'd like to connect. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=808.12s)]
*  And you asked all those questions about things that people are interested in. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=811.0s)]
*  And finally, we hear her talking and she has feelings about everything and opinions on everything. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=815.0s)]
*  And it tells you a lot about that family. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=820.6s)]
*  Yeah, she's definitely not detached. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=822.6s)]
*  She is in the know and she watches the news constantly. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=823.96s)]
*  So here's the book, Melania. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=826.6800000000001s)]
*  You can buy the memoir starting on October 8th on MelaniaTrump.com. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7HZGb0ssgQ&t=829.28s)]
