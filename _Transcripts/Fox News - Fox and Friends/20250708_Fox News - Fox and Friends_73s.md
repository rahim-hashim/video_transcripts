*  Suspect Alexander Dickey was arrested in May after allegedly killing Logan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfFpt2BZZcs&t=0.0s)]
*  Federico during a home burglary in South Carolina. And we now know he has a [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfFpt2BZZcs&t=3.88s)]
*  lengthy rap sheet with nearly 40 arrests dating back more than a decade. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfFpt2BZZcs&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Even after pleading guilty to burglary charges in 2023, he was able to roam [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfFpt2BZZcs&t=14.16s)]
*  free, being given a lighter sentence due to an apparent clerical error. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfFpt2BZZcs&t=19.86s)]
*  Steven, what explanation were you given as to why this guy was still out on the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfFpt2BZZcs&t=24.66s)]

*  served his time, which is 1000% incorrect. Um, the other was a couple [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfFpt2BZZcs&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  weeks after Logan was killed, we received word from an investigative [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfFpt2BZZcs&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  reporter that there was a fingerprint mishap with the fingerprints weren't [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfFpt2BZZcs&t=50.16s)]
*  sent to a sled. Um, and then, um, which was gut wrenching enough. Um, and then [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfFpt2BZZcs&t=55.0s)]
*  about a week later, we found out again from the investigative reporter that it [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfFpt2BZZcs&t=62.120000000000005s)]
