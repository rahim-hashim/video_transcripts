# GOP rep calls out Harris for being a ‘big phony’ on this key issue
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo)

*  And we're going to unleash a manufacturing renaissance right here in Pennsylvania, including [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=13.52s)]
*  fracking like we've never fracked before. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=18.96s)]
*  We're going to frack, frack, frack. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Former President Trump making his case to Pennsylvania voters as he rallies thousands [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=27.04s)]
*  of supporters at a historic rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, less than three months after [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=31.08s)]
*  his first assassination attempt. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=35.9s)]
*  Our next guest was at the rally yesterday and in July. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=38.36s)]
*  Pennsylvania GOP Congressman Dan Muser joins us now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=42.16s)]
*  Congressman, you were at both. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=45.56s)]
*  Give us a sense of what it was like to be there yesterday. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=48.56s)]
*  Well, great to be with you, Pete, Rachel, Will. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=51.2s)]
*  Well, it was a lot of poignant moments. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=55.279999999999994s)]
*  You know, there was a lot of feeling, certainly of memories of July 13th. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=58.31999999999999s)]
*  I had many that were there with me and others asking me what happened that day and where [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  did it come from? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=67.0s)]
*  Where were the shots? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=68.0s)]
*  What did people do? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=69.0s)]
*  Where was the president and so forth? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=70.0s)]
*  You know, so many moving moments. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  I mean, when the president even just flew in and did a couple of flybys, I mean, that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=74.88s)]
*  set a stage that was already beginning with the great speakers that we were having prior. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=80.12s)]
*  The speakers were not the typical congressional and rah-rahs. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=84.96s)]
*  It was poignant speeches from the nurses and the law enforcement and Corey's family, Corey [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  Comperator's family, who I sat with during the entirety of the president's presentation [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  and speech. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=105.44s)]
*  A tremendous amount of patriotism, you know, resolve. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=107.0s)]
*  It really was one of an experience. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=111.44s)]
*  I will never forget. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=114.64s)]
*  It was just such a great day. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=115.64s)]
*  I wish everybody was there to experience such resolve and patriotism and tribute, tribute [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=117.08s)]
*  to, you know, you can't say enough for Corey Comperator. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=125.44s)]
*  The more you know about him and his family, I spoke with his daughters, his sister, his [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=128.32s)]
*  wife. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=133.6s)]
*  I mean, just real, real sadness, yet appreciation for the tribute that was being played, paid. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=134.6s)]
*  So it was really something. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=143.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=144.16s)]
*  Tell me more about the family. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=145.16s)]
*  I mean, I just I can't imagine what they've been through. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=147.28s)]
*  You sat next to them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=149.96s)]
*  What was their reactions to what was happening, to the way they were being honored and their [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  way their loved ones were being, their loved one was being honored, Corey? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=156.64s)]
*  Yeah, you know, they like they were listening. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=160.28s)]
*  They would offer some of their feelings. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=163.88s)]
*  Again, I mentioned appreciation. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=166.12s)]
*  You could you could sense that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=168.92s)]
*  Real deep sadness at the same time. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=171.04s)]
*  And they were they were they were listening intently. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=173.96s)]
*  I mean, they were there for hours. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=175.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=177.6s)]
*  I mean, they were there for to the very end. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=178.6s)]
*  When Ave Marie came up, Rachel, you mentioned that a little bit earlier from Macchio. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=181.76s)]
*  I mean, they were they were in tears. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=186.56s)]
*  Most people there were. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=190.24s)]
*  It was quite moving, compelling, strong, you know, emotional. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=191.76s)]
*  And I'll tell you what, President Trump just handled it so well. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=197.4s)]
*  So graciously, so such dignity and poise and and respect. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=200.92s)]
*  You know, that's what yesterday was about. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=206.48s)]
*  It was really about respect. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=207.92s)]
*  I mean, the president bringing people together. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=210.64s)]
*  He said he was going to come back day of on July 13th. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=212.64s)]
*  He said to Butler, I'm going to be back. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=215.83999999999997s)]
*  He felt that obligation. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=218.0s)]
*  Many of us, probably including myself, didn't think it was a good idea. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  It was a great idea. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it showed America returning, right, rising up to the occasion, getting up to the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=225.04s)]
*  knockdown, you get back up and boy, oh boy, nothing was more symbolic of that than that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=230.88s)]
*  on July 13th when the president did get up, raised his fist and those immortal words, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=235.96s)]
*  iconic words, fight, fight, fight. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=241.28s)]
*  Well, Congressman, you heard the clip we played at the beginning of this segment, Donald Trump [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=243.4s)]
*  talking about the economy, specifically fracking in Pennsylvania. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=247.48s)]
*  I'm curious. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=251.64s)]
*  You're from the area, you know, Pennsylvania, the importance to this election. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=252.64s)]
*  What are you hearing from voters when it comes to not just this issue, but what they think [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=256.52s)]
*  and believe about his opponent, Kamala Harris? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=260.2s)]
*  Well, I'm very pleased that they're getting to know Kamala Harris in the manner she is. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's as of right now, it's a big con. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  She's a phony. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=272.68s)]
*  Who she was before is who she's trying to make over now in order to get elected. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=273.88s)]
*  She stated many, many, many times, and you've heard it, and just on the fracking issue, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  and there are so many policies that are contrary to who she claims she is today. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=284.2s)]
*  But fracking in particular, literally 450 to 500 jobs in Pennsylvania, direct and indirect. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  She stated she was going to ban it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=296.2s)]
*  She said she's going to prohibit it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=297.88s)]
*  We know they're going to overtax it and overregulate it to enormously minimize it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=299.36s)]
*  They've got a, as I tend to say, a guess backwards policy plan for Pennsylvania natural gas, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=304.72s)]
*  literally choosing Venezuela over Pennsylvania, Russia over the United States of America. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=311.0s)]
*  I mean, enriching these nations, enriching Iran. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=317.56s)]
*  You know very well how backwards and contrary and how inverted this policy is. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  It runs contradictory to common sense, enriching our adversaries while minimizing the economy [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  of the United States of America. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  And all the while, we could do it more responsibly, in the name of what? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=339.88s)]
*  Climate change? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, absolute nonsense. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=345.56s)]
*  Yeah, there's no question about that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, Congressman, it was really great to have you here. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=349.88s)]
*  We had Pete there as well and everyone who seems to all agree that it was a moment they'll never forget. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=352.84s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=361.96s)]
*  Thank you, Congressman. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=362.44s)]
*  Yeah, thank you all very much. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=363.56s)]
*  You got it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3vKngxJWo&t=365.32s)]
