# Trump sentencing: ‘Last-ditch effort of lawfare’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8)
*  Judge Juan Mershon, sentencing president-elect, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=0.0s)]
*  trumped to unconditional discharge [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  in his New York hush money case. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=5.26s)]
*  Trump saying the sentencing proves the case [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=6.96s)]
*  should have never been brought up [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  as he will receive no jail time, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=10.5s)]
*  fine or any other punishment. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Constitutional law attorney, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=13.9s)]
*  Katie Czerkasky joins us now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=15.42s)]
*  Good morning to you, Katie. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=17.22s)]
*  Morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=18.18s)]
*  So this sentencing, which is essentially amounts to nothing, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=19.06s)]
*  do you think it is confirmation [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=25.18s)]
*  this case should never been brought against Donald Trump? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  Well, I absolutely think that that's exactly what it says. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=29.44s)]
*  There's going to be no one else in this country [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=32.84s)]
*  that's convicted of 34 felonies [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  and faces absolutely no punishment. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  But Judge Mershon's hands were essentially tied [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=38.52s)]
*  after President Trump was reelected [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=40.88s)]
*  and then they insisted upon going to sentencing [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  in advance of his inauguration [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=46.28s)]
*  because once he's in the White House, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=47.64s)]
*  there's no possibility of having any sort of conditions [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=49.3s)]
*  on his release, no probation, no ankle monitoring, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=52.24s)]
*  nothing like that could be imposed on him while he's there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=55.0s)]
*  So for all practical purposes, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=57.660000000000004s)]
*  this was the only option and it speaks volumes [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=59.28s)]
*  about the strength or lack thereof of this case. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=62.68s)]
*  I think it speaks volumes about the strength [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=65.44s)]
*  or lack thereof of this case. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=67.06s)]
*  I think there are practical issues, as you point out. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=68.9s)]
*  I think it also is, it's hard to escape [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=71.5s)]
*  that there's images one day of Barack Obama [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=73.14s)]
*  calling Donald Trump a threat to democracy [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=75.78s)]
*  and then at Jimmy Carter's funeral, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=77.58s)]
*  him yucking it up with Donald Trump. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=78.78s)]
*  The point is all of this is theater, it's politics. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=81.06s)]
*  And this case included where the goal was to say [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=85.16s)]
*  convicted felon Donald Trump, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=87.94s)]
*  nothing real when it comes to justice. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=89.52s)]
*  Well, absolutely, I think the ultimate goal [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  was to keep him out of the White House, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=93.2s)]
*  but this was the so-called consolation prize. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=94.48s)]
*  So being able to call him a felon, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=96.88s)]
*  it will be very short-lived. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=99.24s)]
*  This case will be overturned on appeal. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=100.4s)]
*  There is absolutely no doubt about it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=102.08s)]
*  We have to remember that this is about supposedly [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=103.48s)]
*  entering a false business entry, calling a legal expense, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=106.32s)]
*  a payment to a lawyer, a legal expense. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  Still unclear how that, even on the misdemeanor side, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=112.0s)]
*  was established at that trial, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=115.32s)]
*  let alone all of the constitutional violations. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=116.7s)]
*  And then, of course, the presidential immunity question. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=118.92s)]
*  So there is absolutely no question in my mind [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=121.4s)]
*  as an appellate attorney that it will be overturned. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=123.84s)]
*  And so this is the last ditch effort of lawfare [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=126.36s)]
*  to have that title on him as he enters the White House. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=129.32s)]
*  I'm glad you brought that up. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=131.96s)]
*  Even if the goal was to get the title convicted felon, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=133.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has won every single one of the cases [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=135.76s)]
*  in the lawfare against him. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=139.2s)]
*  And he will win this one, too, as you point out, on appeal. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=140.96s)]
*  That's every expectation. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=143.56s)]
*  Let's talk about a different case. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  This one at the Supreme Court of the United States. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=146.48s)]
*  It appears, at least based upon arguments [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=148.42s)]
*  made by the justices when they heard the case [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  over the ban on TikTok, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=155.14s)]
*  that they will uphold that ban on TikTok. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=157.01999999999998s)]
*  It did appear that way based upon the justices questioning [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=160.54s)]
*  on both sides of the aisle, as it were, politically speaking. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=163.14s)]
*  The concerns about national security [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=166.73999999999998s)]
*  versus the First Amendment concerns [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=168.78s)]
*  were kind of balanced out there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=170.78s)]
*  I think it's obvious that TikTok cannot continue to exist [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=172.22s)]
*  in the form that it is today in the United States, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=175.42s)]
*  but that does not mean that there are not other options [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=177.72s)]
*  that could alleviate both of those concerns [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=180.0s)]
*  and allow it to continue for people who rely upon it [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=182.42s)]
*  and for the First Amendment purposes [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=185.42s)]
*  that it does provide to American citizens [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=186.77999999999997s)]
*  while considering how to alleviate [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=189.44s)]
*  those national security threats, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=191.44s)]
*  which are very real as well. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=192.7s)]
*  I had Kevin O'Leary, of course, Mr. Wonderful from Shark Tank [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  on the Will Kane Show this week. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=198.14s)]
*  He's one of those people that hopes to buy the brand [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=199.32s)]
*  and the user base of TikTok if it's forced into a sale. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=202.18s)]
*  By the way, this is, let's listen in to the oral arguments [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=205.54000000000002s)]
*  and hear what some of the justices had to say about TikTok. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=208.1s)]
*  Congress is fine with the expression. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=212.06s)]
*  They're not fine with a foreign adversary, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=213.32s)]
*  as they've determined it is, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=216.1s)]
*  gathering all this information [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=218.9s)]
*  about the 170 million people who use TikTok. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=220.78s)]
*  It just doesn't matter that you have creators [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  who want to work with ByteDance, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=226.5s)]
*  because ByteDance is a foreign corporation [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=228.0s)]
*  with no First Amendment rights. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=230.10000000000002s)]
*  There you have it, Katie. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=233.1s)]
*  This does a foreign corporation have free speech, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  have the rights of the First Amendment? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=238.05999999999997s)]
*  Well, they don't, but the question here, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=240.17999999999998s)]
*  and I think some of the justices question [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=242.45999999999998s)]
*  whether this is even a First Amendment case [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=243.98s)]
*  in the first place or if it's about more [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=246.2s)]
*  on the national security side, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=248.26s)]
*  preventing a foreign adversary [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=249.94s)]
*  from collecting information about Americans [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=251.5s)]
*  aside from the fact that it is used as a form of speech. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=253.94s)]
*  So there's a big tension there [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=257.38s)]
*  between two very big priorities, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=259.3s)]
*  which is obviously our First Amendment rights. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=261.18s)]
*  The court has been very protective of those over the years, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  but national security really has to trump that as well. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=265.22s)]
*  So I think that President Trump makes a good point [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=268.34000000000003s)]
*  that if he were allowed to potentially see [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=270.18s)]
*  if there's a middle ground here, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=272.7s)]
*  that it can continue to exist in some form [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=274.06s)]
*  without a full outright ban going into place. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=276.64s)]
*  That might be in everyone's best interest, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=279.24s)]
*  but it doesn't look like the court is going to wait [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=280.82s)]
*  for his inauguration before they make a decision here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU05V6tOiF8&t=282.66s)]
