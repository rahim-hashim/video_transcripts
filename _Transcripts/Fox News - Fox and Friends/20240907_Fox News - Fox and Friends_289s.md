# SCOTUS immunity ruling ‘pretty much invalidates’ NY v. Trump case: Attorney Rebecca Rose Woodland
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84)
*  The suspected Georgia school shooter making his first court appearance after this week's deadly attack the judge warning him that he could face life in prison [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=0.0s)]
*  The 14 year old father sobbing uncontrollably in court at his own hearing [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=8.52s)]
*  He's charged in connection with the tragedy after telling investigators [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=12.92s)]
*  He purchased the gun used in the killing as a holiday present for his son last year [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  So let's bring in Rebecca Rose Woodland a New York based trial attorney Rebecca great to have you on the show this morning [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=20.76s)]
*  I want to ask you about two charges that I find interesting [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=26.76s)]
*  First charging a 14 year old as an adult how uncommon would that be and how likely is that? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  For him to be found guilty as an adult, you know [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=37.36s)]
*  Unfortunately in Georgia when there are felony murders like this that is their law every state is different right? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=40.0s)]
*  We're looking at Georgia now his defense counsel has already indicated that they are going to try to oppose that and have him still be [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=46.56s)]
*  Charged as a juvenile hopefully in that he can possibly see [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=54.4s)]
*  Some sort of parole at some point in his future [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=60.04s)]
*  we're also seeing indications that the child may have been suffering from severe mental illness and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  That there may be a history of that. I don't yeah [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it's the right color wrong call, but I find it interesting when a 14 [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=72.68s)]
*  I'd find that that's a legal hurdle that'll be interesting to watch 14 tried as an adult and then the father [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  You I know we had the crumley case in Michigan some time back [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=82.92s)]
*  Prosecuting parents for the actions of their child [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=87.2s)]
*  We just mentioned he gave the kid who would have been I guess 13 at the time then a gun [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=90.0s)]
*  And so the kid had full access to the gun and that potentially makes the parent culpable in this situation [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  I think it's very fact-specific the Georgia prosecutors are looking at this case saying the FBI came to this home [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=101.28s)]
*  Approximately a year before the shooting last week [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=108.38000000000001s)]
*  They indicated to the parents that there was some sort of forum where the child was posting that he wanted to commit a school shooting [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=111.22s)]
*  They couldn't verify for sure the child said no my account was hacked [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=119.74000000000001s)]
*  But they told the father and the mother now at that some point there after the mother left the household [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=124.38s)]
*  But they did indicate to the father his child cannot have a gun. He cannot have a firearm [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  There is no way that you can allow this because he's under suspicion for some very aggressive violent threats [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=134.26s)]
*  So I think the fact specific aspect of this is what's going to allow that prosecutor to at least [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=141.74s)]
*  Proceed on the manslaughter charges a lot of warning signs a lot of warning signs here in this case. Yeah, okay [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=148.26s)]
*  I want to move to this judge Juan Marchand in New York postponed [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump's sentencing until November 26 after the election [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=157.94s)]
*  I [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=163.36s)]
*  Wanted I'm curious every step of the way throughout this trial judge Marchand has been I would [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  Personally say aggressive towards Donald Trump not friendly to the defense and then all of a sudden he's gonna sentence [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=169.28s)]
*  He's gonna delay sentencing. I mean from the outside. I'm looking at this going what's the motivation? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=174.60000000000002s)]
*  Clearly every time Donald Trump's been indicted or they've gone after him his poll numbers and fundraising have gone up and March on [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=180.68s)]
*  It seemed very political was this a political calculation by Mershon [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=185.84s)]
*  I mean it seems to me that he's in a pickle right judge Mershon's in a pickle. What do I do? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=189.24s)]
*  I sentence someone who's running running right now the forerunner. He will probably be elected president [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=195.28s)]
*  I sentence him before he gets elected [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=201.84s)]
*  when the Supreme Court came down with the case that pretty much [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=206.56s)]
*  Invalidates the entire state court case right all of the evidence. How do you do that? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=211.16000000000003s)]
*  Of course there's going to be an appeal the Supreme Court already said the evidence you used in this case [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=215.92s)]
*  Prosecutor Alvin Bragg cannot be used against a former president because of presidential immunity exactly [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=222.28s)]
*  Yeah, so what we're looking at then a situation where judge Mershon's probably saying well if I sentence him [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=228.4s)]
*  That's not gonna work [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=235.6s)]
*  And if I wait at least we'll see what's going to happen, right? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=236.56s)]
*  You know, he'll probably and anyone who read the Supreme Court decision should just reverse [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=240.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's a bad. It's a bad legal decision in which which will probably be one on appeal at some level [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=247.76s)]
*  I also think that Mershon's a political character and he and at some point you have to look at the political calculation as well [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=252.6s)]
*  I think he did yeah and go wow, this will help Donald Trump if I sentence him [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=258.44s)]
*  Well, we'll never know at this point [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=262.56s)]
*  Yeah, we'll never know but I mean it certainly couldn't hurt Donald Trump because it would be really [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=264.68s)]
*  Obstruction of justice at this point and it would really be in election interfere. Absolutely. All right, Rebecca Rosewood [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2rbXyxM84&t=269.96s)]
