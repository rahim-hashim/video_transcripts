# Fmr ICE head goes off on Dem mayors: This cannot be ‘ignored’ anymore
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc)
*  And welcome back everybody. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=0.0s)]
*  22 minutes after the hour now, incoming border czar Tom Holman joining Fox and Friends after [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=2.0s)]
*  a successful meeting with New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week and revealing that more [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=6.76s)]
*  blue city mayors may be following suit. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=12.42s)]
*  Yesterday I saw a complete 180. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=17.12s)]
*  I saw the cop in him and he has promised to work with us to target violent, criminal, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=18.36s)]
*  illegal aliens in this city. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=26.16s)]
*  And I even gave him credit because once he agreed to sit down, I'm not going to give [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=27.56s)]
*  him names yet, but two other mayors have reached out until I verify they're going to get to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=31.72s)]
*  the table with me. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=35.32s)]
*  Already reached out. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=36.32s)]
*  So I think this starts a domino effect. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=37.32s)]
*  Joining us now is former head of ICE in Denver, John Fabricatori. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=40.36s)]
*  John, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=44.16s)]
*  This is one of those conversations that I think the entire nation is having right now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=45.96s)]
*  And it's very interesting, I think, for me and I think perhaps even for you to listen [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=50.28s)]
*  to what Tom Holman said about not just Eric Adams, but this idea that maybe there'll [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=54.76s)]
*  be more blue city mayors and governors that are finally coming around to this idea that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=59.48s)]
*  the safety and security of the American people is paramount and that has to take priority [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=65.2s)]
*  over politics. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=70.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it just can't be ignored anymore. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=72.08s)]
*  I mean, this crime that's going on can't be ignored. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=75.4s)]
*  And American citizens just want safer communities. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=78.25999999999999s)]
*  They want stronger immigration laws. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=81.74s)]
*  And Tom Holman's just getting in there. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=84.08s)]
*  He's talking to these mayors and he's letting them know exactly what's going to happen. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=85.2s)]
*  Let me show a graphic for the folks at home. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=88.92s)]
*  This is a number of migrants arriving in major blue cities. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=91.02s)]
*  Or I can just tell you about it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=95.28s)]
*  And what was struck out to me is in the last decade in Los Angeles, just for an example, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=97.12s)]
*  226,000 plus just over the last 10 years. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=102.12s)]
*  And when you hear numbers like that, John, I can't imagine what that must do to someone [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=105.12s)]
*  who not only was the former head of ICE in Denver's region. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=109.66s)]
*  I can imagine that if you're the head of ICE in any of the regions around the country, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=113.64s)]
*  that's got to be alarming because we just don't know not only who's coming into this [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=117.56s)]
*  country unlawfully, we don't know what they'll do. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=121.24s)]
*  And we've seen crime obviously play out across the country, unfortunately. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=124.04s)]
*  Yeah, you know, the vetting at the border over the last four years, especially, was [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=127.68s)]
*  just horrific. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=131.76s)]
*  And what we've allowed into this country, like you said, we don't know who's in here [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=132.76s)]
*  right now. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=136.34s)]
*  And the men and women of ICE are just trying to keep the community safe. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=137.68s)]
*  But places like California with sanctuary status, like Colorado, which I live in right [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=141.06s)]
*  now, sanctuary status does not keep communities safe. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=145.33999999999997s)]
*  It just makes United States citizens less safe. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  So we've got to support the men and women of ICE. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=152.85999999999999s)]
*  Tom Homan is going to do this, this go around with President Trump, and hopefully we'll [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=154.94s)]
*  be able to get something done. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=158.48s)]
*  Let me ask you about Trendy Agua. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=160.26s)]
*  People have been talking about this idea of this terrorist organization that's sort of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=163.22s)]
*  masquerading. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=167.66s)]
*  I want to share a little sound and get your reaction on the other side, because I think [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  this is really not just concerning for communities like Denver. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=172.42s)]
*  Obviously, I'm from Colorado. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  You and I have had a chance to talk about what happened over in Aurora. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=177.26s)]
*  But this is something that's spreading nationwide. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=180.5s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  I'll get your reaction on the other side. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=184.01999999999998s)]
*  It's a state-sponsored Maduro regime organization. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=185.42s)]
*  And he understands the criminal mind, how to use the criminals to control the society, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=191.22s)]
*  the Venezuelan society first. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=196.9s)]
*  And then, ah, well, that is a big opportunity also to spread this for all of Latin America, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=198.54s)]
*  to take the virus, like the socialism virus, all over Latin America, and then go to the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=205.46s)]
*  U.S. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  Because they want to create chaos, and they use the TDA as a blackmail for any situation. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=211.5s)]
*  So you're looking at a former Venezuelan military officer talking about this idea that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=218.62s)]
*  not just a gang, as I think most people have described them, but they're actually ideological [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=224.38s)]
*  terrorists disguised as a gang. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=229.42s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=232.01999999999998s)]
*  I absolutely agree. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=233.78s)]
*  You know, I've been talking about this for a couple of months, and, you know, having [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=234.78s)]
*  this Venezuelan military official come on and actually say it, it is absolutely what's [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=237.94s)]
*  happening. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=243.82s)]
*  I mean, what we saw in the beginning is, you know, they came here to the United States. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=244.82s)]
*  They started off in sanctuary cities. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=247.82s)]
*  They use that as a springboard to then jump into a lot of other cities. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=250.02s)]
*  We've got Tren de Arad, what that we know about, in 17 different cities throughout the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=253.74s)]
*  United States right now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=257.94s)]
*  And unless we really put our foot down, this gang is going to continue to grow. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=259.62s)]
*  They want chaos. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=264.14s)]
*  That's exactly what they want. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=265.5s)]
*  John Fabricatore, joining us, the former head of ICE in the Denver region. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=267.7s)]
*  Thank you, my friend. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=271.40000000000003s)]
*  Appreciate your time today. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=273.40000000000003s)]
*  Have a Merry Christmas. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  Hey, Merry Christmas to you too. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QHLkROw0Zc&t=275.40000000000003s)]
