# LA county dep DA goes after Gascón for looming ‘negative story’ hitting the media
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak)
*  The legal paperwork now officially filed in Los Angeles where DA George Gascon is asking a judge to reduce [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=0.0s)]
*  The life sentences for Lyle and Eric Menendez meaning they could be soon eligible for parole [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=6.84s)]
*  The two brothers all smiles in new mugshots taken earlier this month by a California Department of Corrections [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=12.6s)]
*  Photographer as their attorney says he's cautiously optimistic about their release [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=18.32s)]
*  Our next guest who works under Gascon says his boss is just trying to generate publicity ahead of his reelection bid [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=23.380000000000003s)]
*  Los Angeles County Deputy DA Josh John Lewin joins us now. Let's start with motivations John. Thanks for being with us [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=30.46s)]
*  So your contention is Gascon's in a race a reelection campaign [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=38.02s)]
*  This case it's got Netflix docu-series dramas documentaries all over the place a lot of publicity around it. This is a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=43.66s)]
*  Political play for George Gascon [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=52.14s)]
*  It will George Gascon is right now trailing by 30 points [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=55.38s)]
*  His opponent has raised more than two and a half million dollars Gascon currently has [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=60.18s)]
*  $40,000 cash on hand. He has no money for anything and he's being [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=65.94s)]
*  Humiliated with this reelection campaign [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=70.74s)]
*  So when the LA Times was about to publish a very negative story [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=73.66s)]
*  About how he had led a juvenile double murder out and she had then murdered again. He quickly [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=77.7s)]
*  Emails out information that he's gonna do a press release on the Menendez case out of nowhere [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=84.94s)]
*  Does it a couple of days later and then doesn't tell anybody anything now without having thoroughly and carefully reviewed [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=90.74s)]
*  The actual facts of the case. He's going to ask for resensing apparently at the request of people like Kim Kardashian and Rosie [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=98.1s)]
*  O'Donnell two of the leading legal scholars in this nation [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=105.74s)]
*  That's a that's a fair characterization if you could pick up the intended sarcasm [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=110.62s)]
*  I also think the point you're making about the way this was thrown together does reveal part of the motivations [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=115.5s)]
*  This came together very quickly and thrown out there with a press conference very quickly [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=120.48s)]
*  But I do want to ask you this because you you are a prosecutor [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=124.68s)]
*  Set aside the motivations for just a moment of George Gascon. Is it a just call for resentencing? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=128.22s)]
*  We've had a debate here this morning on Fox and Friends between two attorneys do the Menendez brothers with actual new evidence [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=134.2s)]
*  Suggesting they were subjected to abuse by their father deserve [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  Another look at their sentencing [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  So that's the big problem. First of all, there is no new evidence whatsoever [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=148.76s)]
*  If and if you look at the evidence that you have [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=154.04s)]
*  The Menendez brothers have a history particularly Lyle of fabricating evidence in this case [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=157.88s)]
*  That's documented not my opinion. That's the opinion of the two courts that have reviewed it the letter that you have this alleged letter [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=163.14s)]
*  It's a photocopy. It's undated but more than that both the cousin and Eric testified at trial [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=170.42s)]
*  They never mentioned this letter. The reason they didn't mention the letter will is it hadn't been written yet [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=177.38s)]
*  But even worse the letter says that allegedly it was sent eight months before the murders [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=182.7s)]
*  The problem is both of them testified that Eric had not talked about the molestation [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=189.34s)]
*  For approximately eight years before the murder [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=195.66s)]
*  So the problem with the letter is not only is it not credible that it was written when it was allegedly written [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=198.86s)]
*  It's inconsistent with the testimony of both of them. So let's look at this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=204.86s)]
*  How can two individuals be rehabilitated if in fact they are falsely accusing? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=209.34s)]
*  Their parents from the grave of molestation and of ignoring molestation [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  They are killing them all over again. These are two calculated killers [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=221.14s)]
*  Spoiled individuals who murdered their parents for money and inheritance. That's what it is. They're not rehabilitated [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=226.94s)]
*  It's very important to have this kind of resensing when it's appropriate. This is not an appropriate case [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PpJmQ6eak&t=234.62s)]
