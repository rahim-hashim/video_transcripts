# 'ABSOLUTE ANGER': Victim's family outraged after Biden commutes killer's death sentence
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ)
*  Joe Biden commuted the death sentences of 37 death row inmates just two days before [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the families of their victims gather for Christmas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=6.2s)]
*  Biden defending his move explaining, quote, I condemn these murderers and grieve for the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=9.44s)]
*  victims of their despicable acts, but guided by my conscience and my experience, I am more [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=13.88s)]
*  convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=19.44s)]
*  Joining us now are Heather Turner, Katie Jenkins, and Danny Major, the daughters and husband [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=24.04s)]
*  of Donna Major, who was murdered back in 2017 in a bank robbery by a career criminal whose [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=29.64s)]
*  sentence was just commuted by President Biden. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=35.72s)]
*  I'm sorry to be talking to all three of you under these circumstances. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  I cannot even put myself in your position to know how difficult this would be any week, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=43.44s)]
*  but especially Christmas week. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=49.56s)]
*  Heather, what was your reaction when you heard the news? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Anger, absolute anger. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=54.64s)]
*  We were told from our prosecution team on Sunday afternoon. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=56.8s)]
*  I was actually gathered with my in-laws for our family Christmas. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=60.8s)]
*  My sister was gathered with her in-laws and we got the call and I was angry. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=64.84s)]
*  I'm still angry. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=69.96s)]
*  I am upset that this is even happening, that one man can make this decision without even [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=71.72s)]
*  talking to the victims, without any regard for what we've been through, what we're going [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=80.0s)]
*  through. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=85.12s)]
*  I'm completely hurt, frustrated, and angry. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=86.12s)]
*  So Heather, nobody gave you a heads up that this was coming from the White House? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=89.64s)]
*  So in May, we heard that this was a possibility and at that point, we began writing letters [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=93.84s)]
*  to the pardoned attorney. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=99.12s)]
*  I reached out requesting an in-person meeting in D.C. and we were refused. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=100.44s)]
*  They denied our right to have our voices heard that we're victims. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=107.44s)]
*  My mother was murdered at the hands of Brandon Hanzel. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=112.92s)]
*  They should have heard our story and all we got was a 10-minute virtual conference and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=116.72s)]
*  clearly that fell on deaf ears. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=123.56s)]
*  They did not want to hear our story. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=125.52s)]
*  Danny, Joe Biden or whoever made this decision, because it is entirely unclear whether this [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=127.64s)]
*  came from him directly or his people. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=133.16s)]
*  He's showing mercy to your wife's killer. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=136.4s)]
*  Was your wife showing any mercy? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=139.8s)]
*  She was showing no mercy at all. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=142.6s)]
*  This man walked into the bank, never said two words to her, shot her three times in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=144.12s)]
*  total, went and shot her coworker, Katie Skeen as well, who was totally defenseless and unaware [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=149.76s)]
*  that anything was happening. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=156.16s)]
*  It's just beyond me that I can't even believe that this has actually happened. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=160.8s)]
*  The commuting of sentences like this of 37 victims, all but three, which was certainly [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=166.04s)]
*  a political scheme, but no undoubtedly. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=171.92s)]
*  Joe Biden was also told by the Pope that he should stop these executions. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=177.04s)]
*  Now, what the Pope has to do with anything in this country, I don't know, but Joe Biden [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  certainly has no convictions. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=187.32s)]
*  He's a senile old man. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=189.32s)]
*  He couldn't tie his shoes, I wouldn't think, if you could see him in person. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=190.88s)]
*  It's absolutely disgusting. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=195.28s)]
*  Well, continuing his MO of the past four years, he bent to the far left, whether it is this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=196.96s)]
*  far left Pope, which many Catholics have said about this Pope or members of his own party, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=202.56s)]
*  he has bent the knee to the left wing of the Democrats. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=209.32s)]
*  And that includes squad member Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, who said this to the news. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=213.08s)]
*  Listen. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  The death penalty has not been proven to be a deterrent of crime. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=220.28s)]
*  State sanctioned murder is not justice. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=225.32s)]
*  And today, what President Biden did demonstrated moral leadership, compassionate leadership [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=227.72s)]
*  informed by his own faith. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=234.44s)]
*  It has had a disparate impact on low income people, black people and other marginalized [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=235.94s)]
*  persons. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=240.4s)]
*  Katie, when Ayanna Pressley refers to compassion, what is your response to the congresswoman? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=241.4s)]
*  Compassion? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=251.11999999999998s)]
*  I don't think that that's compassion. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=252.11999999999998s)]
*  The fact that he didn't talk to any of us, the victims of this crime, you know, we trusted [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=254.92s)]
*  the judicial system. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=261.88s)]
*  We sat through court. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=264.0s)]
*  I watched my mother be murdered. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=265.4s)]
*  I watched images of her body laying on the ground. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=268.32s)]
*  He does not have compassion for who? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=272.36s)]
*  A criminal? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=275.52s)]
*  A criminal? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=276.52s)]
*  No. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=277.52s)]
*  No, I don't agree with that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=278.84s)]
*  I don't agree with that at all. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=281.32s)]
*  Heather, off the top, you mentioned Christmas celebrations that you've already tried to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=283.2s)]
*  have. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=288.28s)]
*  How do you get through Christmas following news like this when you have to put on a brave [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=289.28s)]
*  face for kids for whom we really do celebrate this holiday to watch the joy and the magic [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=293.7s)]
*  and the excitement in their eyes? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  How do you get through this, Heather? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=301.96s)]
*  Jesus, the reason for the season. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, we wouldn't be celebrating Christmas if it wasn't for Christ and his birth. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=306.76s)]
*  And he is what has gotten us through this entire thing. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=312.0s)]
*  We have leaned into Jesus. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=315.5s)]
*  He has provided us strength and a peace that is beyond all understanding because he's the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=318.12s)]
*  son of peace. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=324.12s)]
*  And I'm just so thankful for the Lord and for my faith and for my family. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=325.12s)]
*  I have three small children. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=332.76s)]
*  My sister has one baby. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=334.0s)]
*  She's a year old. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=336.44s)]
*  My brother has two children. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=337.44s)]
*  My mom had six grandchildren, only three of which she met. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=338.76s)]
*  Our job is to make Christmas as special and as magical as we can. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=343.32s)]
*  And we're going to do that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=347.36s)]
*  Danny, same basic question to you. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=348.96s)]
*  How do you get through this as a grandpa, knowing that you lost the love of your life? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=351.2s)]
*  She's never coming back, but this killer has been spared the death penalty. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=355.72s)]
*  Well, probably the worst thing for me through this whole thing since day one was watching [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=362.6s)]
*  my three children, Doug, Heather and Katie, suffer through this. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  If it was just me, I'd be OK with that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=371.64000000000004s)]
*  I know Donna is with her Savior right now. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  Not because she was a good person or anything like that, but because she trusted him as [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=377.36s)]
*  Lord and Savior. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=380.76000000000005s)]
*  As far as the grandchildren go, the few that were here with us, they probably don't have [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=382.48s)]
*  a whole lot of memory of her, but there still is a great loss in that, just knowing that [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  they'll never get to see her or be loved by her or touch her or hug her or hold her. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=394.0s)]
*  He does a great job of filling in. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=400.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm sure he does. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=402.76s)]
*  He's incredible. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=404.4s)]
*  Katie, final question to you. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=405.52s)]
*  The exact phrase used by the White House in their release announcing these pardons and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=407.12s)]
*  commutations is that Joe Biden is committed to a fair and effective justice system. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=411.47999999999996s)]
*  Katie, what about this is fair to your family? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=418.6s)]
*  None of it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=424.52s)]
*  None of it, because we didn't commit that crime. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=425.52s)]
*  Brandon counseled him. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=429.56s)]
*  He made that choice that day, a crime that is punishable by the death penalty. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=430.8s)]
*  We, 12 jurors unanimously voted for the death penalty. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=437.0s)]
*  That is what was fair. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  And Biden took that away from us. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=445.64s)]
*  A senile, old, incompetent man took that away from our family. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=448.12s)]
*  Justice. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=453.6s)]
*  Just like that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=454.6s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphn3B-7vZQ&t=456.36s)]
