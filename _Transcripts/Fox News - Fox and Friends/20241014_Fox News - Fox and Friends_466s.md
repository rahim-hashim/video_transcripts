# Man arrested outside Trump's Coachella rally had multiple guns, passports
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y)
*  Four minutes before the bottom of the hour to another Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=0.0s)]
*  A 49-year-old man fined and released after police say they caught him with loaded illegal [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  guns and a fake press pass near Donald Trump's Saturday rally in Coachella, California. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=8.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, the suspect maintaining his innocence, telling Fox News Digital, quote, I always [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  travel with my firearms in the back of my truck. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=19.56s)]
*  I've literally never even shot a gun. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=22.32s)]
*  I'm the last person that would cause any violence and harm to anybody. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=25.16s)]
*  I'm 100% a Trump supporter. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=29.8s)]
*  This is a man I deeply admire. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=31.92s)]
*  Riverside County, California Sheriff Chad Bianco joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=33.96s)]
*  Sheriff, do you believe him? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=37.64s)]
*  Is that why he's out? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, no, that's not why he is out. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=42.2s)]
*  I certainly read his statements and they're believable statements. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=44.68s)]
*  And I hope that was the case for his sake. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=50.44s)]
*  But it doesn't change the fact that he brought the guns onto a Trump rally and he was stopped [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=52.96s)]
*  before he got inside. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Inside his car were rifles and guns unregistered, were passports with different names. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  He had a phony license plate and inside the SUV it was all torn up. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=68.44s)]
*  He had a lot of explaining to do. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=73.48s)]
*  What did you do when you began to unravel what he might have been up to? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=75.48s)]
*  Well, quite honestly, at the time with President Trump arriving, as you can imagine, it's not [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=81.56s)]
*  a calm scene. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  It's a very chaotic scene with people trying to get in there and vehicles coming in and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  the president on his way. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=94.4s)]
*  So the original deputy that stopped him and talked to him and noticed all these things [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=96.16s)]
*  and eventually ended up getting his consent to search the vehicle, located all of these [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=102.0s)]
*  items. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=107.16s)]
*  Had he not had that encounter with that deputy, he certainly would have been on the grounds [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=108.84s)]
*  where he would have more than likely ended up was probably only a few hundred yards, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=115.08s)]
*  couple hundred yards from the stage where President Trump eventually was. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=119.24s)]
*  But that's all speculation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=124.32s)]
*  We don't know because we did our job and we stopped him from getting on the grounds in [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=126.96s)]
*  the first place. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=131.8s)]
*  You indicated in some of your comments afterwards the federal government didn't get involved. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=132.8s)]
*  The law enforcement did not get involved. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=137.32000000000002s)]
*  Would you think he possibly stopped a third assassination attempt? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  You know, in our minds we did. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=142.24s)]
*  That's what we were set up there for. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  We were set up to stop and prevent anyone from coming on the grounds like happened the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  last time and it worked. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of speculation that he's just an innocent person and he very well [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=154.28s)]
*  could be with his intentions to not. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=158.4s)]
*  He had no intention to harm the president, but out of the, you know, between the 25 and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=161.0s)]
*  the 50, depending on the numbers that you're hearing, thousand people that came to the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=166.84s)]
*  rally, only one brought guns. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=170.16s)]
*  And so we were thankful that our deputy found him and he was removed before the president [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=172.68s)]
*  even got there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=178.32s)]
*  So you think 50,000 people came there, you were able to secure it, you're very proud [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=179.32s)]
*  of that and you should be. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=182.68s)]
*  But when you get him in jail and you detain him, why does he out today? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=183.68s)]
*  Because it seems there's a very little, just this, what we're talking about now, I would [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=188.32s)]
*  think if I was doing that, I'd be still in jail. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, in hindsight, I mean, it's probably for the rest of the country, it's hard to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  believe that when we arrest people, they don't stay in jail, but that's a fact of life here [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=200.88s)]
*  in California. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=206.72s)]
*  And those crimes that we arrested him for were misdemeanors and we do not hold misdemeanors [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=207.88s)]
*  in custody. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=213.0s)]
*  So he was giving a citation to appear at a later date. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=214.0s)]
*  And I've been told, I don't know the date, but I think it's after January, it's after [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=216.7s)]
*  the new year. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=220.66s)]
*  So we've been dealing with bad law enforcement policy for decades in California and unfortunately, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=221.66s)]
*  the whole world sees it now. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=228.98s)]
*  I mean, the frustration must be overwhelming because you're doing your job and you're not [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=230.1s)]
*  allowed to by the idiotic laws you're forced to live by. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  But let's look at this right now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=237.26s)]
*  Do we know anything about them? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=238.94s)]
*  Miller, his background, does he have a history? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=240.73999999999998s)]
*  He says he was a Hollywood guy who changed his beliefs because it was a homogenous community [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=243.3s)]
*  was something to that effect. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=248.22s)]
*  What else do we know about it? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=249.56s)]
*  Well for us, we know very little. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=251.94s)]
*  And I think a lot of the problem that we are seeing now is the social media world is just [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=254.66000000000003s)]
*  taking on a life of its own. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=260.0s)]
*  And of course this is big news, but a lot of people fill in blanks where there are blanks [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=261.32s)]
*  and most of the time they're wrong or they add things. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=265.62s)]
*  controversy is he had a license plate on his vehicle that was unregistered, which is strange. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=269.72s)]
*  And then the license plate was indicative of people that adhere to a sovereign citizen [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  is what we refer to them as. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  I think they refer to themselves as that belief in that the government rules and laws don't [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=287.08000000000004s)]
*  apply to them. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  And he had a license plate on his car that was this indicative being used by those people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=293.48s)]
*  So by saying that, and it's a little bit of a detriment to law enforcement to me when [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  we try and be as open as we possibly can, that that's misconstrued later on. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=305.94s)]
*  And so I never said that he was part of that group. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  I said it's indicative of that group of people that believe like that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=314.56s)]
*  But at the time we knew nothing about him. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=317.74s)]
*  up to the FBI to find out his background and what he was involved in, if anything. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=319.68s)]
*  And I'm sure that will come out later. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=325.12s)]
*  But all we can go off of is what we see at the time and what we know. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=328.12s)]
*  And what we know now is the only thing that we could arrest him for was those weapons [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  violations. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=337.16s)]
*  Do we know that's his real name? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=338.16s)]
*  I couldn't tell you what his real name is. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=341.0s)]
*  The only thing I can say for sure is this is a personal belief. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=343.56s)]
*  The identifications, the different identifications that he had, Vem was consistent. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=347.96s)]
*  So I'm sure his name is Vem. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=353.64s)]
*  But there were different names and different variations of Miller or other names. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=355.84s)]
*  And so I honestly I couldn't tell you what his real name is. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=362.24s)]
*  See, I thought you could keep him for 48 hours. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=365.56s)]
*  And being that there's so many questions about him, being how well armed he is and the lies [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=368.36s)]
*  that he's happy, the different IDs he's happy to use, the different passports he had on him. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=374.36s)]
*  I mean, this is whole things reek of suspicion. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=382.36s)]
*  Any one of these things seems overwhelmingly reason to keep him detained. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=384.56s)]
*  But you say your hands are tied. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=389.12s)]
*  Well, yes, I don't want to say our hands are tied. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=391.44s)]
*  I'm telling you that, you know, unfortunately or fortunately, fortunately for him, unfortunately [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=393.84s)]
*  for us in California, that's all we can hold him for is the weapons charges. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  And it's a misdemeanor. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=402.76s)]
*  And it is a sad fact that we can't hold misdemeanors in jail. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=403.88s)]
*  They just they're released with citations. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  So I think he did go to jail. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=412.92s)]
*  He was booked. But I believe he was only there for four to six hours and then cited and released. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff30o9N5N2Y&t=414.59999999999997s)]
