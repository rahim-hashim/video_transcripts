# El Salvador president mocks Dem senator's meeting with deported MS-13 suspect
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0)
*  Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen meeting face to face with a suspected MS-13 gang member in El Salvador. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=0.0s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=8.0s)]
*  Madeline Rivera is live in Washington with the details. Good morning, Maddie. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=9.0s)]
*  Good morning, guys. This was a turn of events after Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen was initially denied from entering that maximum security prison where Kilmar Abrego-Garcia is being held. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=13.0s)]
*  Van Hollen posting this photo on X saying he's spoken to Abrego-Garcia's wife and will give a full update soon. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=23.0s)]
*  El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele is mocking this meeting saying in part Kilmar Abrego-Garcia has miraculously risen from the death camps and torture. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=29.0s)]
*  He also suggests he's still not looking to release Abrego-Garcia saying he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=39.0s)]
*  Per the New York Post, a conservative watchdog, the American Accountability Foundation is now demanding an ethics probe into Van Hollen's El Salvador trip. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=46.0s)]
*  The organization's president says Senator Van Hollen decided that he would use Senate funds to fly to El Salvador and advocate for an enemy of the United States. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=54.0s)]
*  But Van Hollen argues the government has not backed up its claim that Abrego-Garcia is a member of MS-13. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=62.0s)]
*  I have been fighting against MS-13 for probably longer than Donald Trump even heard about MS-13. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=69.0s)]
*  The administration says an immigration judge back in 2019 found reliable testimony that Abrego-Garcia was a member of MS-13 but who wasn't deported because of safety issues. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=81.0s)]
*  Here's President Trump talking about the case. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=91.0s)]
*  I have to refer again to the lawyers. I'll have to do what they ask me to do. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=94.0s)]
*  I had heard that there were a lot of things about a certain gentleman, perhaps it was that gentleman, that would make that case be a case that's easily winnable on appeal. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=99.0s)]
*  So we'll just have to see. I'm going to have to respond to the lawyers. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=111.0s)]
*  The legal back and forth means this case could ultimately land back in the hands of the Supreme Court. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=114.0s)]
*  Lawrence Ainsley and Brian. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=119.0s)]
*  Incredible. Thanks, Maddie. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=121.0s)]
*  So Senator Van Hollen was able to get his interview. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=123.0s)]
*  So Democrats have margaritas with MS-13. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=126.0s)]
*  Well, we don't know that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=129.0s)]
*  That's what he did. It was a margarita. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=130.0s)]
*  Pictures look like it was water. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=132.0s)]
*  I think that was. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=134.0s)]
*  Why do they have salt on the rim of water though? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=135.0s)]
*  You're saying that because President Bukele said that miraculously he's risen from the death camps and the torture, now sipping margaritas with Senator Van Hollen in a tropical paradise of El Salvador. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=137.0s)]
*  Okay, first of all, why is he in shackles? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=150.0s)]
*  Why is he in shackles? Where are they eating? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=154.0s)]
*  He's allowed to leave the prison and then come back? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=156.0s)]
*  Or is that like some restaurant at the prison? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=158.0s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=161.0s)]
*  I don't know what deal they were, I don't know what they were drinking, but at the end of the day, why are you doing this with a criminal? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=162.0s)]
*  Especially, maybe you could have claimed ignorance before, but over the last couple days, the DOJ has released what the judge said, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=167.0s)]
*  There was credible information from sources that he was a part of MS-13. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=175.0s)]
*  He appealed that and another federal judge said the same thing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=180.0s)]
*  Then we found information that he's been beating his wife and there was credible two different situations. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=184.0s)]
*  Angel, I think you have some of the stuff. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=191.0s)]
*  Yeah, she applied, his wife applied for a protective order against her husband in 2021. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=193.0s)]
*  This is what she said. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=197.0s)]
*  She said, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=198.0s)]
*  She was afraid to be close to him, hit her at least two times in 2020, once with his boot, another time left her with a purple eye. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=228.0s)]
*  So also on his mugshot, when he was actually arrested at that at that Home Depot, they talk about him hanging out with known MS-13 gang members. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=236.0s)]
*  You don't usually hang out with gang members if you're not in the gang, but let's just keep going. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=244.0s)]
*  During the interview with officers, they observed that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie with rolls of money covering the eyes, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=248.0s)]
*  ears and mouth of the presidents on the separate denominations. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=254.0s)]
*  Officers show such clothing to be indicative of the Hispanic gang culture. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=258.0s)]
*  The meaning of the closing is represent, see no evil, hear no evil, say no evil. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=262.0s)]
*  And that's when you wear the MS-13 stuff. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=267.0s)]
*  So that's why a judge looked at his case and go, this guy's in the gang. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=270.0s)]
*  When he realized he was going to be shipped out, he said, I can't because I'm claiming asylum. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=273.0s)]
*  They go, well, we're going to reject something because if you rejected, don't send me back to El Salvador because I think I'm going to my life's going to be a mess. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=278.0s)]
*  Well, that was one reason why he wasn't deported. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=284.0s)]
*  Yesterday, he made a statement saying that he had no fear of going back to any Central American nation. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=287.0s)]
*  So what are you talking about? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=293.0s)]
*  So this guy's story, he's a wife beater for a month. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=295.0s)]
*  She had an order of protection. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=298.0s)]
*  He was picked up with known gang members and he was having wearing gang member things. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=300.0s)]
*  And when he was arrested, he had drugs on him and rolls of cash. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=305.0s)]
*  Yet he has no job. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=309.0s)]
*  That's the man Democrats are going to back. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=310.0s)]
*  And he was human trafficking in Tennessee as well, taking people from Texas, trying to get them to Maryland. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=312.0s)]
*  And we have the Suffolk County District Attorney who is prosecuted over his 75 members of MS-13. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=318.0s)]
*  He goes, part of the reason why we don't have part of the violent history is because he was right below a homeboy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=325.0s)]
*  So to get officially initiated in there, you have to commit some violent act. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=331.0s)]
*  So he hadn't reached that stage, that level of MS-13 yet. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=337.0s)]
*  At this point, he was just an errand boy, but still part of the violent organization. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=342.0s)]
*  Two courts said he was an MS-13, even though he's denying it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=346.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump declared that a terrorist organization. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=350.0s)]
*  So therefore, he is here illegally or was here illegally, and he's considered a terrorist. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=353.0s)]
*  Real quickly, I think this is important because a lot of people have been asked, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=358.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't they put the source that found him to be a part of MS-13 on the stand? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=361.0s)]
*  Remember, I've been talking about protecting sources and methods. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=368.0s)]
*  So I talked to the Suffolk County District Attorney last hour, and he said, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=370.0s)]
*  The only time we put the source on the stand is if it's a murder case. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=374.0s)]
*  Because once you use that source, you can't use them anymore. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=379.0s)]
*  Because part of MS-13 is they want to go after rats. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=382.0s)]
*  You killed the rats. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=385.0s)]
*  So the people that are confessing to the cops who are the sources, they killed them. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=386.0s)]
*  So they said they've got to put them in protective custody. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=390.0s)]
*  So if they're going to burn a source, then it has to be a murder case. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igL7h3Gc7j0&t=393.0s)]
