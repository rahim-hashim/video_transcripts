# BREAKING: ICE arrests 500+ migrants with criminal records
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc)
*  Let's check in with Lawrence Jones. He is live down on our southern border in El Paso [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=0.0s)]
*  He visited Fort Bliss with our defense secretary and our friend Pete Hegsath for that first border visit since his confirmation [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=4.62s)]
*  And then they also flew on a Blackhawk with Tom Homan as well. Hey Lawrence [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=11.76s)]
*  Hey, good morning family [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=18.32s)]
*  I just want to piggyback on your last conversation because this is why the Secretary of Defense Pete Hexa was here [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=19.68s)]
*  You know a lot of people don't know but we have a military [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=26.96s)]
*  Assets that focus on the narcotics that impact our country was created back in the 60s by JFK [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=31.72s)]
*  And that's US Southern command right here in Fort Bliss. That's why the Secretary of Defense was here [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=38.66s)]
*  He said that we haven't been using these assets the way we should [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=45.32s)]
*  It's clear that there's a threat coming across the border as it relates to the drugs and they're gonna get active real fast [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=49.2s)]
*  Here's a little bit of our conversation yesterday [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=56.48s)]
*  We have no better negotiator at the helm than our commander in chief Donald Trump knowing how to use [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=59.56s)]
*  Economic pressure to get results on the ground. Let's see how Mexico responds with troops and whether or not [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=64.92s)]
*  They they actually do stem the flow [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=70.8s)]
*  But all I know is what we can affect [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=73.32s)]
*  And we are not gonna back down [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=75.44s)]
*  Intimidation is not gonna work [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=77.76s)]
*  And I want the message I have for the troops here is across the board is we have their backs [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=79.52s)]
*  We have your back [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=85.08s)]
*  We're gonna give you the tools necessary to get a hundred percent [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  Operation control of that border a lot of people talk about the corruption in Mexico. Can we trust those guys? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=90.0s)]
*  Will they actually be helpful? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=94.94s)]
*  to the mission [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=97.08s)]
*  First administration President Trump [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=99.52s)]
*  You know made next report never turn the border and it was very effective [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=102.24s)]
*  He made next row agreed to remain next row program, right? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  This is national security when we secure the border less people die from Patanah less women children sex traffic [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=109.02000000000001s)]
*  Less people on terrorist watch those cross that border. This is national security issue president Trump gonna shut it down [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=115.62s)]
*  So [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  Some people may be under wondering what the setup is why have Tom Homan [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=124.54s)]
*  The borders are on one side and the Secretary of Defense Pete hexes on the other side [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=129.26s)]
*  The secretary made it very clear Secretary hexa. He's gonna focus on the outside [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=133.02s)]
*  Of the board going after the enemies there making sure the border is secure from that aspect [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=138.94s)]
*  Tom Homan is gonna focus on border patrol the interior aspect of it as well as with ice [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=143.82s)]
*  Hunting the bad guys the criminal aliens with inside of the country. It's a two-pronged approach [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=149.62s)]
*  And then you got Marco Rubio that is gonna be communicated with all those foreign companies [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=155.66s)]
*  I'm sorry countries to make sure they take their people back and they prevent them from coming to the country in the first place [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=160.3s)]
*  Unless they want to do it the legal way. That's right. And yesterday Marco Rubio negotiated a deal with El Salvador now El Salvador [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  Will be a safe third country. So any anybody from let's say China the China won't take back [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=173.92s)]
*  We can now send them to El Salvador. They they said we'll take everybody including members of MS 13 and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  Trendy Aragwa as well [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  So that that is going to be very helpful because just think about it [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=189.0s)]
*  If you are being trafficked across the southern border by a cartel, I have no idea how they're gonna get in [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=192.12s)]
*  But if they are how do you make that pitch? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=197.72s)]
*  All right [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=199.96s)]
*  If you get into the country you could live in San Diego or you could live in Omaha or whatever [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=200.42s)]
*  But now the news is if you get in the country you might get sent essentially to a mega prison in [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=206.02s)]
*  El Salvador or Gitmo. Yeah, and Lawrence was mentioning Tom Homan the interior of our country over the weekend [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=213.56s)]
*  They nabbed so many people I stood the senior Trump administration official that that talked to Fox News [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=221.32s)]
*  Digital said agents nabbed over 700 illegal immigrants over the weekend including more than [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  500 with convictions or charges and I was looking through the list one person a Honduran national [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=234.28s)]
*  Arrested in San Antonio, Texas close to where you are Lawrence and she had a conviction of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=240.2s)]
*  Another one in Seattle a Mexican citizen with a conviction for robbery and delivering meth one in Phoenix, Arizona [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  A Mexican national with a murder conviction one in Detroit a Colombian man convicted of domestic violence and possession of cocaine [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=251.8s)]
*  So I just want to give you a tidbit Ainsley because those are the people that are already in the country [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  So we got to prevent them from even been able to to make that journey across [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=266.64s)]
*  Banks who is he used to be the Texas border czar? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  He's now the chief of Border Patrol four-star [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=275.48s)]
*  He had a process when he was the borders are in Texas with the National Guard [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=278.76s)]
*  Essentially obstructing him to push them back. So what you've seen during the Biden administration a lot of the micers would just surrender [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=282.56s)]
*  They've already did the app and they knew they were going to get a notice to appear and then they would be released in the country [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  Pete Hicks said the Secretary of Defense is adopting that same strategy with the troops on the border now [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=296.56s)]
*  So people aren't just gonna be able to surrender if they see people trying to break in the country [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=302.0s)]
*  They're gonna say go back [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=307.76s)]
*  They will push them back and if they attack those border agents like with a mob like [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=308.8s)]
*  They do with some of these caravans. They're gonna have the pepper bullets as well like Texas used in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=315.0s)]
*  So you're not gonna see this surge of people coming across the border anymore [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=320.72s)]
*  There are people there to meet them when they try to cross the border [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  And of course that underscores the the very vital importance of the remain in Mexico policy [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=330.12s)]
*  Because if they never actually crossed the border then it doesn't become a problem. It doesn't become our problem [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=336.32s)]
*  That's exactly right and that that is why the troops are on fire right now. They got fire in their belly right now [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=343.76s)]
*  They get to do their jobs [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=349.88s)]
*  By the way, I told you earlier about I spoke with some of those troops [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=351.64s)]
*  We're actually gonna air some of that conversation to me speaking just with rank-and-file [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean in the last administration we were prohibited from talking with them. We didn't get to hear their stories [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=359.08s)]
*  Finally the shackles are off of them and they can tell the American people how they feel [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=365.52s)]
*  That's great. You said morale is up and Brian kill me keep saying and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=370.44s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong that our border crossings are down 93% isn't that the statistic he always says substantial [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=374.79999999999995s)]
*  It's a big number [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=382.54s)]
*  Yep, that's right and and they're trying to get the numbers daily so we can have a track it but it's around the 90s [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=385.5s)]
*  I think you're correct [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=391.7s)]
*  It's so so Lawrence when you were in that ride-along in that Black Hawk going from where you are El Paso [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=393.38s)]
*  To the west through New Mexico [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=401.02000000000004s)]
*  How big are the existing gaps in the wall? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=404.42s)]
*  There are some big gaps and I'm so glad you asked that question I got to talk with [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=411.90000000000003s)]
*  The former borders are of Texas as well [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=418.82s)]
*  Who's now the over all the border patrol chief of Border Patrol and I asked him about the money because this is a question [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=421.06s)]
*  That y'all guys asked me yesterday in the show [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=426.42s)]
*  He said essentially they haven't used money from 20 20 21 and 24 [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=428.84000000000003s)]
*  So they're gonna already start the construction of the border wall now [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=433.94s)]
*  It's not gonna be enough to complete all of the wall they're gonna need that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=438.70000000000005s)]
*  Reconciliation bill to pass but there's enough money to restart the Trump wall [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=442.98s)]
*  That was that that was incomplete have they been able to get all those pieces back that the previous president tried selling off [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=448.14000000000004s)]
*  No, no they have it they were able to stop some of it because a federal judge made them stop [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=457.38s)]
*  Selling off the wall before in that past administration, but a lot of that stuff was sold [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=463.82s)]
*  And you got to remember we had already paid for that and then they were so they were so [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=468.66s)]
*  Upset with Texas Texas offered to buy the rest of that wall that they were selling to reconstruct it ourselves [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=475.1s)]
*  We were gonna pay billions and dollars to do it and the Biden administration refused to sell it to Texas [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=481.62s)]
*  So that was a lot of just petty behavior from the last administration [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=487.46s)]
*  That made us less safe as a result [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=492.3s)]
*  Yep [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=494.66s)]
*  And then your governor had to step in and say we're not selling this wall just to the to the lowest bidder [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=495.02000000000004s)]
*  We need this wall to stay here and then Donald Trump, of course took over and hopefully those what's left of it [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=500.82000000000005s)]
*  We'll be able to be used again intentional indeed and Lawrence just mentioned a moment ago tomorrow [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=506.18s)]
*  He will be featured from Texas where we once again are going to hear from some of the troops Lawrence great job [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=512.14s)]
*  Great to see you [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=518.58s)]
*  You [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgZjbmiXGfc&t=521.66s)]
