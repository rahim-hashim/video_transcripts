# Rep. Waltz: This was not a coincidence
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU)
*  Incoming National Security Advisor Mike Waltz joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike, what have you learned about this horrific tragedy, this terrorist attack, and what do [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=3.68s)]
*  you think that needs to be done now as you prepare to come in a new administration to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=11.18s)]
*  protect the nation from further attacks? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=16.54s)]
*  Well, thank you, Griff. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  And look, here's the bottom line. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=25.16s)]
*  The terrorists around the world, ISIS, al-Qaeda, and their offshoots, didn't get the memo that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=28.46s)]
*  the war on terror is over. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=34.7s)]
*  They still hate us. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  They are plotting and planning to attack us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=37.980000000000004s)]
*  And we have to be on maximum guard. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=41.34s)]
*  We have kept President Trump informed throughout the last 24, 48 hours. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=43.540000000000006s)]
*  And look, two things. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=51.82000000000001s)]
*  One, we've got to take a hard look at our defenses. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=53.18000000000001s)]
*  First and foremost, close our border, where we've had over 300 people on the terrorist [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=56.9s)]
*  watch list traverse our border in the last years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=63.46s)]
*  Number one. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=68.14s)]
*  Number two, I'll remind everyone, just in the last year, we had eight ISIS operatives [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=69.14s)]
*  rolled up surveilling sites to hit in three different cities. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=72.86s)]
*  A number of them from that cell are still unaccounted for based out of Tajikistan. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=77.34s)]
*  And there's a defensive aspect of this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=83.62s)]
*  There's a law enforcement and intelligence. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=85.98s)]
*  And then there's the offensive aspect. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=87.38s)]
*  And taking a hard look at our strategy overseas, our posture, our basing for our special operators [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=90.18s)]
*  and our intelligence operatives to keep a lid on ISIS, al-Qaeda, and others, whether [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=97.26s)]
*  it's Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and other places where they may be plotting and planning to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=102.7s)]
*  hit us. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=108.76s)]
*  You know, Congressman, I want to put, if you could put your door kicker hat back on [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=109.76s)]
*  as a Green Beret. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=114.58s)]
*  When I talk with people in the community, when I talk with law enforcement, they all [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=116.46000000000001s)]
*  tell me the same thing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=119.78s)]
*  We're focused on the wrong things. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=121.46000000000001s)]
*  We're not focusing on the threats to this country right now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=123.1s)]
*  Are you hearing that as well? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=127.78s)]
*  That they look at yesterday as a mission failure. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=129.9s)]
*  We had Americans that died. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=132.98s)]
*  And something needs to change immediately. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=134.88s)]
*  I mean, it's great that we got the former president coming back in. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=136.78s)]
*  But something could happen between that time. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=141.38s)]
*  You know, you're absolutely right. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=147.66s)]
*  But I want to echo others in praising law enforcement that literally ran to the sound [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=149.02s)]
*  of gunfire, ran into a hail of bullets, and stayed engaged and took this son of a, just [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=155.56s)]
*  took him out. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=162.82s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=163.82s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=164.82s)]
*  It was a failure. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=165.82s)]
*  We need to look at whether we had intel indicators. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=166.82s)]
*  We need to look at how he was radicalized online. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=169.68s)]
*  I'm particularly interested. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=173.8s)]
*  We'll be looking to the National Counterterrorism Center. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  Was he externally planned, plotted, and directed from ISIS operatives overseas? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=178.8s)]
*  Or was this truly homegrown? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  If it was homegrown, then was there some type of a mom, mosque, or other type of radicalization [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=186.08s)]
*  element that is not only radicalizing him, but others internally? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=193.44s)]
*  Again, guys, I can't emphasize enough. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  Close the border. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=202.76s)]
*  Secure our sovereignty. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=204.34s)]
*  You know, and that is completely unacceptable. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=206.44s)]
*  The entire world knows that we have an open border. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=210.88s)]
*  They intend to hit us, and they are pushing people into our interior to do just that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=215.1s)]
*  And they know that if we're looking internally at ourselves, we can't be defending ourselves [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=220.6s)]
*  abroad. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=226.16s)]
*  That entire counterterrorism strategy, particularly now that they have a caliphate again in Afghanistan [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=227.28s)]
*  where ISIS and al-Qaeda are brewing, has to, we just have to do a complete day one relook. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=234.0s)]
*  Hi, Congressman, Sandra here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=241.0s)]
*  So as this story moves forward and hour by hour, we anticipate that we will get more [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=242.28s)]
*  information about all of this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=246.32s)]
*  As the incoming national security adviser, what is it that you are going to be looking [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=248.24s)]
*  for as the feds start to give us more information? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=252.6s)]
*  Well, that one, that number one, that external plotting versus internal radicalization, how [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=257.32000000000005s)]
*  that happened. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=266.0s)]
*  Number two, I find it an amazing coincidence, but I don't think it is a coincidence that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=267.38000000000005s)]
*  you had two attacks renting from the same site, both veterans, that you could have a [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  more radicalized and broader sell. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  You also had an Afghan that was stopped from making election day attacks. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=285.08s)]
*  So this is why getting President Trump's cabinet in is so important. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=289.6s)]
*  We need Governor Noem at DHS. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=295.44s)]
*  We need Cash Mattel at FBI. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=297.4s)]
*  We need Pete Hegseth at DOD. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=298.86s)]
*  This is an across the government look. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=301.5s)]
*  Marco Rubio at state and of course, Radcliffe at CIA and Gabbard, Tulsi Gabbard at DNI. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=304.04s)]
*  That has to be in place day one, guys, because this is a moment in transition of vulnerability [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=313.04s)]
*  and President Trump is going to project because he is a leader of strength. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=318.44s)]
*  The narrative that we project on day one will be just important and that's having our people [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=324.3s)]
*  in place. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=328.82000000000005s)]
*  And lastly, Congressman, during this transition period, just 19 days to go, are you currently [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=329.82000000000005s)]
*  in contact and getting briefings from your counterpart, Jake Sullivan? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  I have been in contact with Jake Sullivan, the current national security adviser, through [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=339.68s)]
*  the last 24 hours. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=348.24s)]
*  They are trying to piece together information, but we're not waiting on what we're just getting [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  from this White House. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=356.12s)]
*  Everybody has their feelers out so that we keep President Trump as informed as possible. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=358.12s)]
*  And I can tell you what, he is ready to go day one, 19 days to go. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=363.1s)]
*  Let's go real quickly because we have to go, Congressman. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=368.12s)]
*  I'm not asking you to reveal classified information, but was there a chatter about this guy? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=370.24s)]
*  Not that I've been briefed, not that we know of at this point, but again, we've got to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=379.88s)]
*  look at the National Counterterrorism Center. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=385.48s)]
*  That's one of the reasons they exist and our intel community is fully engaged to see what [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=387.64000000000004s)]
*  was going on from abroad. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=393.56s)]
*  Congressman, I appreciate your time today. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=395.16s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk-4WxD8pU&t=397.64s)]
