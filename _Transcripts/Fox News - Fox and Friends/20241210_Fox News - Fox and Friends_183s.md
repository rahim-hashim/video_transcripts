# Longtime Democratic judge switches parties in monumental move
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI)
*  A former Democratic stronghold in Texas flipping red for the first time in 100 years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=0.0s)]
*  Look at those numbers. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=6.4s)]
*  Our next guest is a long-time Democrat and top elected official in Laredo who says his [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=7.58s)]
*  party is leaving behind Texans and the values that they hold dear. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=12.8s)]
*  Judge Tano Tiarina joins us now with a big announcement. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=16.9s)]
*  Good morning to you, Tano. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=20.5s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Good morning to my Fox friends. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, we are glad you are here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Merry Christmas, Judge. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=26.52s)]
*  Alright, so Judge, why are you a Democrat? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=27.64s)]
*  Well, that's not really the answer. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=31.8s)]
*  The question should be, you know, I've just, you know, it's been, I've made a decision [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=34.8s)]
*  after careful thought and prayer and discussions with my family and community. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=38.44s)]
*  And over the years, I've watched the Democratic party shift further and further to the left [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=43.16s)]
*  and leaving the values that I hold dear to my heart. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=48.0s)]
*  I've always been a conservative and the radicalization of the National Democrats pushed me away a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=50.6s)]
*  long time ago. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=55.08s)]
*  And for that reason, I'm proud to announce that today I will be leaving the Democratic [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=56.4s)]
*  party and joining the Republican party and I'm proud of that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=60.8s)]
*  Okay, very good, Judge. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  So a lot of people in your area might say, well, it's only because Donald Trump won in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=65.88s)]
*  your area. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=70.08s)]
*  You're doing this so you can win the next time around. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=71.08s)]
*  What would you say to them? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=73.02s)]
*  Well, people think of others the way one thinks. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=74.36s)]
*  And I get it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=77.52s)]
*  You know, it's just the way it is. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=78.52s)]
*  But unfortunately, we've been, I have a moral compass and I cannot answer for anybody, let [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=80.62s)]
*  anybody know what they want to do. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=87.3s)]
*  But for me, I've been seeing this go so further and further left. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=88.66s)]
*  You know, you have the, we need to have border security. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=91.82s)]
*  I think it's a little bit more. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=95.06s)]
*  Oil and gas industry has been threatened here in South Texas. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=96.06s)]
*  You know, and then to be able to see everything that's going on from our, you know, the woke [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=100.22s)]
*  movements, you know, from the girls playing, the boys playing in girls sports and whatnot. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  Hey, listen, it's just it's something that I had to do. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=108.3s)]
*  It's something that's dear to my heart and I have a moral compass that I need to continue [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=111.06s)]
*  moving forward. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=114.34s)]
*  Yeah, that does not fly in South Texas. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=115.34s)]
*  I used to live in San Antonio. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=116.58s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=117.97999999999999s)]
*  What do you what's the reason? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=118.97999999999999s)]
*  Do you think that Donald Trump won in your area? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  Why is it changing in that area? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=122.5s)]
*  Is it the border? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=123.74s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=125.58s)]
*  I think a lot of the people here, first of all, you know, when we look at down here in [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=126.58s)]
*  South Texas, our Democrats really are not the same as national Democrats. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=130.1s)]
*  We're very conservative for the most part. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=134.42s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=136.54s)]
*  I think everybody started to understand and realize what was going on these last three [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  to four years to be able to see what's going on through the border and everything like [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=140.73999999999998s)]
*  that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=144.73999999999998s)]
*  Hey, it was a big as a county judge. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=145.73999999999998s)]
*  It was a huge effect on us, not only financially, but a burden wise to be able to security wise [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=147.38s)]
*  to secure our borders, too. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=152.42s)]
*  So I think with Donald Trump and what he's going to do and some of his initiatives, I [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=154.62s)]
*  think it's going to be good. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=159.14s)]
*  Well, Judge T. Arena, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G890cDIHZXI&t=160.78s)]
