# Activist sends warning to 'woke' protesters: You have been fooled
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME)
*  Israeli flags, green laugh being set on fire on the street in New York City, as you can [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=0.0s)]
*  see, and several arrests in a pro-Palestinian protest in Philadelphia, 30th Street Station. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=7.28s)]
*  These are scenes across the United States as anti-Semitic incidents are on the rise. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=13.42s)]
*  They're at historic levels, according to our FBI director. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=18.32s)]
*  And tomorrow down in our nation's capital, pro-Palestinian protesters are set to stage [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  their biggest demonstration in American history. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=26.0s)]
*  Our next guest joined the Muslim Brotherhood as a teenager, but eventually got out. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=30.92s)]
*  Iain Al-Hersi Ali is an activist and Hoover Institute researcher, and she joins us right [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=36.72s)]
*  now from the West Coast. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=42.64s)]
*  Ali, rather, Iain, good morning to you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=43.64s)]
*  Good morning to you, Peter. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=48.04s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=49.24s)]
*  I'm very good. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=50.24s)]
*  I'm Peter's dad. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=51.24s)]
*  So, let me... [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=52.24s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=53.24s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=54.24s)]
*  I'm just going to pause all the time. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  Iain, so what are you thinking is going to happen tomorrow in Washington with this gigantic [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  pro-Palestinian demonstration? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=62.28s)]
*  It's really a pro-Hamas demonstration. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=66.56s)]
*  And there are a lot of people there who think of themselves as progressives and who have [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=69.72s)]
*  progressive causes and are going to march for Hamas and not for Palestinians, because [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=75.4s)]
*  if you are truly for the Palestinian people, you would be marching against Hamas. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=80.48s)]
*  There's a concept and radical Islamist theology, and it's called Taqiyah, or fool the infidels. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=86.68s)]
*  And a lot of people who've been fooled by Hamas will be marching out there tomorrow. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=94.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=98.76s)]
*  And, you know, people forget, Iain, that the whole goal of a lot of people is to wipe Israel [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=99.76s)]
*  off the map completely. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=107.12s)]
*  Tell them all, get rid of them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=109.48s)]
*  Maybe people just don't quite remember that part. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=112.12s)]
*  They know, yeah, October 7th, I think that was propaganda, people are being told. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=115.56s)]
*  But Joe Biden, who has been very vocal, we are in complete solidarity, the United States [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  is, with Israel. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=127.64s)]
*  And yet his progressive flank, they're the ones who are supporting all of these pro-Palestinian [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=129.8s)]
*  groups. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=136.4s)]
*  I was a very harsh critic of Joe Biden in the way he left Afghanistan. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=138.36s)]
*  But right now I compliment him and his administration for the strong position they've taken. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  It's a very strong moral position in support of Israel, and I think by extension, true [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  Palestinians. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=153.84s)]
*  But yeah, the Democratic Party is divided. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=156.62s)]
*  The younger generation has gone woke and progressive. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=159.70000000000002s)]
*  fooled by Hamas in disguise. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=165.4s)]
*  They have been told that they're marching for the rights of Palestinians and for the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=169.28s)]
*  lives of Palestinians, but they're not. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=174.16s)]
*  In effect, these people are marching to obliterate Israel off the map. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=176.24s)]
*  When you hear, cease fire, what it translates into is let Israel stop fighting for itself, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=181.86s)]
*  Let Hamas regroup and let Hamas come back and do what Hamas says in its charter, and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  that is to completely eradicate and obliterate Israel off the map. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=198.04s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=204.84s)]
*  So you see what is happening here in the United States, particularly on college campuses. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=207.0s)]
*  I spoke to a young woman who got a master's degree from Stanford. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=211.4s)]
*  She's very upset with Stanford not coming out to completely condemn what Hamas did [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=215.84s)]
*  to the Israelis. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=221.28s)]
*  Here she is Wednesday on this program. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=222.4s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=224.88s)]
*  Very best friend at one point told me that she really hoped to become a suicide bomber. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=226.88s)]
*  This is how terrorists are being made. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=232.36s)]
*  They're not being made in some dungeon in Afghanistan. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=234.56s)]
*  And when we see these kind of calls on campus for Intifada, Smash the Jew, these are calls [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=237.32s)]
*  for violence. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=244.0s)]
*  Some people on campus came from a reality maybe similar to mine, where you are brainwashed [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=245.16s)]
*  from a very young age to hate Jews. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=250.52s)]
*  And that is such an important point, Ayan, because, you know, her best friend, one of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=254.28s)]
*  her best friends wants to be a suicide bomber because when you grow up in certain parts [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=259.36s)]
*  of this world, you are raised to want to kill Jewish people. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=264.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=269.28s)]
*  When I joined the Muslim Brotherhood as a teenager, we were taught that the biggest [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=270.65999999999997s)]
*  enemy to Islam, they are the Jews. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=275.18s)]
*  It's the state of Israel. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=278.46s)]
*  We believed in it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=279.7s)]
*  We prayed for it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=280.7s)]
*  And Sophia, the student whom you just showed, she really has a point in saying people are [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=282.18s)]
*  not being radicalized in dungeons in Afghanistan. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=289.09999999999997s)]
*  They're being radicalized in our ivory towers. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=292.46s)]
*  Some of them are radicalized and some of them are fooled because this woke revolution that's [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=296.22s)]
*  underway in universities in America has given Hamas and the allies, Islamist allies of Hamas, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=301.1s)]
*  an opening to radicalize, to fool and to disassemble and to lie and to put their cause forward. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=308.46s)]
*  And their cause is to eradicate, to obliterate the state of Israel and to kill Jews. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=315.78s)]
*  Let's just state it as plainly as possible. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=322.08s)]
*  That is what they want. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=325.62s)]
*  And if you're out in Washington, D.C. or any of the other European cities thinking that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=327.22s)]
*  you're demonstrating for the Palestinian people, you're lying to yourself. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=331.74s)]
*  You're not. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=336.74s)]
*  Great point. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=337.74s)]
*  Ayan, thank you very much for joining us today. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tASnNDybPME&t=338.74s)]
