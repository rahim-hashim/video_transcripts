# 'BIGGEST SHOCK EVER': Hosts stunned by KJP ditching Dems
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE)
*  Now, out of everything that's happened, including Jake Tapper's book, because he let Joe Biden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=0.0s)]
*  have a pass for four years and suddenly realizes with 200 sources he was out, this to me, the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  biggest shock ever. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=11.8s)]
*  So Kareem Jean-Pierre is now an independent after she defended Joe Biden for the last [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=14.68s)]
*  four years and he left office a few months ago in January and now she said she's leaving [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=21.2s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=27.24s)]
*  She will be an independent and she wrote a book and it's called Independent. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=28.72s)]
*  So here's what she said. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=32.96s)]
*  In an era of misinformation, disinformation, the regressiveness of social policy, what [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=35.64s)]
*  we're seeing currently right now, what I have decided to do and I really have thought long [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=40.96s)]
*  and hard about this is to follow my own compass. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=46.32s)]
*  And here's the truth and here's how I will lay it out to you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=50.64s)]
*  I think we need to stop thinking in boxes and think outside of our boxes and not be [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=54.2s)]
*  so partisan. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=60.68000000000001s)]
*  I don't think this is going to go the way many people think it's going to go. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=62.64s)]
*  It looks like she's still going to defend Biden and I think they have some similarities [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=67.12s)]
*  there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=71.48s)]
*  The party really did not like Biden but they used him for a period of time because they [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=72.48s)]
*  felt like he was the only person that could be with Trump. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=77.34s)]
*  And also the party didn't like Kareem Jean-Pierre as well. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=79.22s)]
*  No one wanted her to get the job. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=82.88s)]
*  They gave it to her anyway. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=85.16s)]
*  She was terrible at the job and so I think she's had enough with the Democratic Party. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=86.16s)]
*  The one thing she's not going to be able to overcome is how she concealed the president's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=90.52s)]
*  health for so long every single day at the podium. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=93.96s)]
*  So evidently, by the way, this is the ultimate infighting already. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=96.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=100.12s)]
*  Text messages, chat rooms because nobody liked her, thought she was good at her job and needed [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=101.12s)]
*  done trying to get rid of her. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  She wouldn't leave. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=105.66s)]
*  Jeff Zeitz, the chief of staff, they tried to line up a job I think with Angie's List [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  or somebody like that and she wouldn't take it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=111.2s)]
*  But this is what makes me think that maybe she's going to blow up Joe Biden too. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=114.16s)]
*  Look inside a broken White House. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=117.84s)]
*  Look inside the broken White House. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=120.84s)]
*  So who breaks the White House but the president, the family, the nucleus, the Politburo. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=121.84s)]
*  So she's out there screwing up his messaging. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  What they say, insiders would say that she knew nothing about the policy, that they said [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=130.0s)]
*  they make Joe Biden's defense look so bad because she kept reading out of her binder. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  So she was so jealous of John Kirby. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=139.8s)]
*  The admiral would go up there to explain war, hostages, all this stuff. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=142.12s)]
*  He wouldn't, she would not let him pick his own reporters to go out. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  So is Kirby going to defend himself? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=149.74s)]
*  I'm sure he's going to get implicated. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  That was her way of saying this is my territory. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=154.88000000000002s)]
*  Don't step on my ground. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  You're not going to the podium. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  I'm in charge here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=159.10000000000002s)]
*  This is what some of the democratic operatives have told the media. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  The job market is really tough right now for Biden's spokespeople and I cannot begrudge [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=164.8s)]
*  anyone who needs to make a quick buck because she's selling her book. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=169.04s)]
*  Former Biden administration official told Politico, everyone thinks this is a grift. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=173.28s)]
*  John Pierre's former staffer. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=178.4s)]
*  She made a joke about being an independent last year and now it's a book. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=180.24s)]
*  All ideas are monetary, even the dumb ones. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=184.44s)]
*  But can we just all agree how dirty the Democratic Party is? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=186.84s)]
*  What there is is these quotes about Karine Jean-Pierre or the quotes that are provided [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=191.28s)]
*  in Jake Tapper's book. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=196.0s)]
*  No one wants to put their name on it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=197.54s)]
*  You hear cabinet official, former administration official, no one puts their name on these [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=199.48s)]
*  quotes and says, I just didn't like her. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=204.14s)]
*  I didn't think she was good at his job. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=206.16s)]
*  Actually I did think the president was unfit to do the job. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=207.88s)]
*  No one puts their name on it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=211.04s)]
*  But the thing is, as you say you're an independent, you just basically said you lied about everything [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=212.04s)]
*  that you said. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=217.16s)]
*  Not spin, lie. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=218.64s)]
*  Now I know Scott McClellan for George W. Bush came out and wrote a book because he felt [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=219.64s)]
*  alienated and out of the nucleus. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=223.6s)]
*  But you know you have Ari Fleischer, Dana Perino, Tony Snow during those eight years [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=225.72s)]
*  when we're in the middle of two wars. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=229.52s)]
*  But this is after she's done with the job. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=231.72s)]
*  One of the quotes was, she made a joke out of being an independent last year and now [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=234.48s)]
*  it's a book. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=238.18s)]
*  All ideas are monetary, even the dumb ones. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=239.24s)]
*  That's according to a Biden staffer. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=242.72s)]
*  So is she becoming an independent because she's angry with Joe Biden and his family [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=244.74s)]
*  and everything she saw behind the scenes at the White House? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=251.76s)]
*  Or is she becoming an independent because she wants to continue to defend Joe Biden [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=254.72s)]
*  and she is angry at the party for what they did to her boss? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=259.96s)]
*  I was watching all the traffic of all the people that defend Joe Biden that are his [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=263.52s)]
*  like close allies. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=268.21999999999997s)]
*  They were all defending Kareem Jean-Pierre. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=269.8s)]
*  They were all online saying, hey, just wait for the book. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=272.06s)]
*  She is still in Biden's camp. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=275.78s)]
*  This is a message to the Democratic Party. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=277.42s)]
*  She ends up being one of his advisors at the end, which was scary for America. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=280.04s)]
*  But remember as we go back and remember what she said about the man that we know was not [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=284.64s)]
*  really there. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=289.68s)]
*  Does the president have the stamina, physically and mentally, do you think to continue on [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=291.72s)]
*  even after 2024? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=296.48s)]
*  Don, you're asking me this question. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=298.12s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=300.16s)]
*  He's the president of the United States. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=301.16s)]
*  You know, he, I can't even keep up with him. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=302.96s)]
*  And how is President Biden ever going to convince the three quarters of voters who [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=305.72s)]
*  are worried about his physical and mental health that he is OK, even though in Las Vegas [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  he told a story about recently talking to a French president who died in 1996? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  I'm not even going to go down that rabbit hole with you, sir. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=319.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, look, that was, as I said, it was a cheap, you know, a cheap fake. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  That was definitely a cheap. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  It was. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=328.76000000000005s)]
*  Well, he also said he's sharpest before 8 p.m. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=329.76000000000005s)]
*  So say that the Pentagon at some point picks up an incoming nuke. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=333.64000000000004s)]
*  It's 11 p.m. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=337.8s)]
*  Who do you call the first lady? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=338.8s)]
*  He has a team that lets him know of any of any news that is pertinent and important to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  the American people. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=347.24s)]
*  Who ordered White House officials to cover up a declining president? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=348.56s)]
*  I know that that is a narrative that you love. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=354.76000000000005s)]
*  First of all, there's been no cover up. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=358.0s)]
*  I want to be very clear about that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  Jake Tapper's book and this book, Peter Doocy is going to need so much therapy because he [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=363.04s)]
*  nailed this story. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=369.84s)]
*  He couldn't get any confirmation. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=371.32s)]
*  You see how exasperated he is. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=372.84s)]
*  And now it's all confirmed now that they're out of office. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=374.24s)]
*  So, hey, you lied. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=376.92s)]
*  Now you're cashing in. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K30n3kL_CZE&t=377.84000000000003s)]
