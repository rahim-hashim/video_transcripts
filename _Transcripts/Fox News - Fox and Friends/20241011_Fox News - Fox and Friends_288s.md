# 'DEEPLY CONCERNING': CBS facing scrutiny over on-air controversies
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA)
*  So what's the real reason why Democrats keep claiming the GOP is pushing misinformation? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=0.0s)]
*  One of the best in the business, Matt Taibbi, CMI and read him on Substack, joins us now. Matt, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=5.28s)]
*  what's behind this big move to talk about misinformation and blaming Donald Trump specifically for it? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=10.08s)]
*  Well, they keep changing the definition of misinformation and disinformation, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=17.52s)]
*  and they have another category they call malinformation. But I think the exchange [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=21.44s)]
*  you just saw between Kareem Jean-Pierre and Peter Ducey was incredibly revealing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=26.88s)]
*  When she identified the way he was phrasing the question as misinformation, there are actually [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=32.32s)]
*  kids' books out now about misinformation that define the asking of questions themselves as a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=37.92s)]
*  form of misinformation. This is one of the things we found in the Twitter files is that people who [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=44.16s)]
*  question authoritative sources or who don't pay attention when they surface authoritative sources, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=48.96s)]
*  that's considered misinformative to ignore the dictates of officials. So what she's really [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=56.24s)]
*  saying there is you're not listening to what I'm saying. We're saying we're doing the best we can, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=64.16s)]
*  and you're questioning that, and that's misinformation, which is crazy. Essentially, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=70.08s)]
*  they're saying it's a lie to question the government. It really is. And the problem is [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=74.8s)]
*  there was a lack of coordination between the people like Cory Mills with their private choppers. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  The army was ready to go four days prior. These are legitimate questions. They waited a week to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=83.92s)]
*  call them. When they got in, they turned the whole thing around, and those people are still [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=89.2s)]
*  suffering today. But they're focusing on Donald Trump and misinformation, and it's about the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=92.64s)]
*  campaign, which one Joe Biden is not even in. I think he knows that well. If I can, let's talk [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=96.72s)]
*  about something different that's also causing controversy. CBS, their morning show, their host, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=101.76s)]
*  decides to take on Tahisi Coats on his anti-Israeli stance in his book. It's a fine debate. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=107.44s)]
*  He doesn't seem upset by it. Here's a portion of it. And it's what I struggled with throughout [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=114.88s)]
*  this book. What is it that so particularly offends you about the existence of a Jewish [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=119.84s)]
*  state that is a Jewish safe place and not any of the other states out there? There's nothing that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=126.08s)]
*  offends me about a Jewish state. I am offended by the idea of states built on ethnocracy, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=131.28s)]
*  no matter where they are. This went up for five minutes, and all of a sudden, CBS is apologizing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=136.08s)]
*  They're giving special psychological treatment to the rest of the staff. He had to have a teary-eyed [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=142.0s)]
*  explanation of his series of questions. Matt, what planet are we on? This is the new world we live in, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=150.08s)]
*  where when a person says something that is even a little bit off narrative, they have to, in order [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=157.44s)]
*  to stay in the good graces of mainstream media or their social circle, they have to go through [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=164.24s)]
*  these public struggle sessions. But that's an extraordinary situation, especially given what [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=171.84s)]
*  happened with 60 Minutes earlier this week when they put out two different versions of an interview [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  with Vice President Harris and then did not explain it to the public. That was a major event in the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=185.12s)]
*  history of American journalism to edit a presidential interview during a campaign. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=191.28s)]
*  Those two things, those two episodes show that the networks are very worried about one thing, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=199.12s)]
*  but they're not worried about traditional journalistic ethics, which is deeply concerning. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=203.6s)]
*  I just want to show you this real quick. Gail King was able to ask an anti-Israeli [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=208.56s)]
*  question, had no problem. Watch this same show, different host. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=213.2s)]
*  It seems to be all about politics. What do you say about that? You know, you have innocent [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  children in Palestine, Palestinians who are dying, innocent Israeli children who are dying, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  and no one seems to be able to say enough, stop that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=227.84s)]
*  I'm not interested in politics at all. His daughter is being held hostage. Your thoughts? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I don't understand the idea of trying to get an answer out of a relative, of a hostage, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=241.28s)]
*  in that situation. I mean, everything is politicized now. I mean, that reminds me a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=250.0s)]
*  little bit in a weird way of the question in the debate where they're talking about the hurricanes, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=255.84s)]
*  and the first thing I think to talk about is global warming. I mean, yeah, it's just completely [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=262.88s)]
*  crazy. It is, Matzee. You see an agenda and everything, but the American people are making [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=268.8s)]
*  their own decisions. They're not being led by that. I think that's pretty clear. Matt Taibbi, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=272.88s)]
*  thanks so much. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley Earhart. And click [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKhOiTSrecA&t=277.28000000000003s)]
