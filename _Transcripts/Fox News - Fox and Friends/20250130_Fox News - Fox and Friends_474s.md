# BREAKING: Over 30 bodies recovered in DNC plane crash, NSA says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc)
*  National Security Advisor and U.S. Army veteran Michael Waltz joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=0.0s)]
*  Michael, it's good to see you brother. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=4.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, it's under these circumstances. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=7.68s)]
*  Your top line thoughts on this crash? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=10.32s)]
*  I know as a door kicker, you've been in many of these aircrafts before. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=12.16s)]
*  How does something like this happen? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=16.4s)]
*  Yeah, thanks Lawrence. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=18.48s)]
*  Look, this is a terrible tragedy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=21.32s)]
*  I know I can speak for the president and that our heart is broken. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=24.4s)]
*  But at this point, we are all hands on deck. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=29.84s)]
*  And I can tell you that he was updated throughout the night. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=33.64s)]
*  As you know, Secretary Duffy was on the scene. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=38.2s)]
*  NTSB was on the scene. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=42.28s)]
*  We spoke with Mayor Bowser. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=45.08s)]
*  I spoke with Governor Youngkin. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=48.0s)]
*  This is again, all hands on deck from the Park Service to the Coast Guard to local, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  both state and local responders, the airport recovery services. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=58.12s)]
*  And I've also spoken with the military. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=63.31999999999999s)]
*  To answer your question, Lawrence, this was a routine training flight. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=66.88s)]
*  As you know, a Blackhawk typically has two pilots. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  In this case, it was and I can tell you it was an officer. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=76.24s)]
*  And a warrant officer, they tend to have a lot of experience. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  And then you have an enlisted crew chief in the back. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=84.68s)]
*  So we'll let the investigation unfold is what happened. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=88.44s)]
*  But, you know, our hearts go out to the families. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=93.08s)]
*  American Airlines and their CEO has also been in touch for all of those notifications. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  And then, you know, finally, God bless those Coast Guardsmen and those rescuers, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=103.56s)]
*  those park police that are down in those frigid waters, you know, making sure that we don't have [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=108.96s)]
*  they're doing everything they can to make sure we don't have a fuel spillage. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=114.83999999999999s)]
*  And they've recovered. They've recovered now over 30 bodies. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=118.32s)]
*  Yeah. And Michael, what adds to the calculus regarding trying to figure out what happened? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=122.28s)]
*  You know, this airplane, this American Eagle Airlines Eagle flight from Wichita was coming in [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  over the water, which at night it's dark. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=136.08s)]
*  You don't really see how far up you are. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=138.36s)]
*  You can see the lights in the distance. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=141.56s)]
*  And it looks like the chopper just came in from the side there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=143.04s)]
*  I don't imagine there is any spot on Earth that is going to have so many [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=147.72s)]
*  records of what went on in the sky before that, because everything is being tracked. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=152.76s)]
*  Given the fact that you're at the White House and they've got all sorts of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=159.36s)]
*  sensors to see if anything's flying at the White House. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=163.32s)]
*  And it's the same thing down there by where the crash occurred. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=166.44s)]
*  It's close to the Pentagon. So many sensitive sites. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=170.12s)]
*  So much is going to be a gigantic digital trail. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=173.32s)]
*  I think there will be, although pulling all of that together [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=178.72s)]
*  may take a little bit of time because it is various agencies that are involved. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=182.84s)]
*  You know, Brian, one of the questions, excuse me, Steve, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  one of the questions that I have is, you know, were the pilots under night vision? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=194.16s)]
*  Were they not? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=199.52s)]
*  You know, those are things that that the investigators will have to, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=201.16s)]
*  you know, will have to determine. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=206.0s)]
*  And, you know, at this point, we are on monitoring. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=207.8s)]
*  We are making sure everyone has the resources. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  I sent one of my senior staff from the National Security Council [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=216.23999999999998s)]
*  to the D.C. Emergency Operations Center to make sure those local, state [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=220.68s)]
*  and federal resources are all integrated [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=227.0s)]
*  and are coordinating and doing the best we can to recover this site. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  About 4 a.m. this morning, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=236.0s)]
*  unfortunately, we transitioned from response to recovery. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=239.24s)]
*  Oh, wow. Does that mean everyone? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=243.84s)]
*  That's what it's looking like. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=247.16s)]
*  That's what it's looking like at this point. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=249.04s)]
*  Do you know how long it will take to find out what happened? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=250.76s)]
*  I know they've recovered one of the black boxes, at least. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=253.56s)]
*  That's what Lucas was saying. He's there on the ground. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=255.88s)]
*  How long would it take? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=258.8s)]
*  I don't have a direct or definitive timeline at this point. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=262.0s)]
*  Again, Secretary Duffy is on the ground. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=267.6s)]
*  NTSB got on the ground very quickly. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  And they will unpack all of this from the digital footprint, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=274.24s)]
*  the radar track, what we know from GPS movements, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=278.16s)]
*  exactly what the Black Hawk pilots were saying, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=282.76s)]
*  doing and seeing and their flight trajectory. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=288.36s)]
*  Obviously, there's a huge piece here with the air traffic controller [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  and what they saw in those last moments [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=295.36s)]
*  and the instructions that they gave. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=298.28s)]
*  So we'll pull all of those together from those various agencies. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  Part of our job here is to coordinate all of that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  and then to keep both the president, the vice president [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=307.96s)]
*  and all of the senior folks in the administration informed. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  Just so people know what the Black Hawk looks like, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=315.55999999999995s)]
*  it's got four blades, twin engines, medium lift, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=318.0s)]
*  utility military helicopters, so modified version developed [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  for the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=323.79999999999995s)]
*  It carries 15 people, including two pilots, two crew chiefs [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=326.24s)]
*  and two rescue specialists. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  Three U.S. Army soldiers were on board during the crash. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=331.76s)]
*  Now, right away, Michael, people are looking at this and saying, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  Sean Duffy had the job for a couple of hours. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=339.28s)]
*  Now he's on the scene with a windbreaker on and he's got to assess it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=341.32s)]
*  And then you have an OMB director who can't even get a vote, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=344.88s)]
*  who would have certainly helped with that executive order two days ago. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=348.56s)]
*  And wouldn't it be great to have a DNI in place ahead of time? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=352.0s)]
*  You just now got a secretary of defense. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=355.88s)]
*  He, 48 hours on the job, is offering out offering out statements and procedures. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=357.88s)]
*  There's got to be more of an urgency in the Senate to get your people confirmed. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=364.44s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=368.88s)]
*  Brian, so many people are brand new in the job, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=371.84s)]
*  but they also bring so much experience to these jobs. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=375.36s)]
*  And as you saw last night, nobody is sitting back. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  We're leaning forward in the saddle and getting right there on the scene, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=382.16s)]
*  showing leadership, showing determination to get to the bottom of what happened. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  But to your point, yes, the president needs all of his cabinet officials. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  He needs all his players on the field. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=397.0s)]
*  I can tell you from my perspective with what's going on in the Middle East, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=399.16s)]
*  the wars were going to stop in Ukraine, Russia, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=403.64000000000004s)]
*  the movement on the southern border and taking on the cartels. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=407.24s)]
*  I need a director of national intelligence like yesterday. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=410.52s)]
*  And but we're going to get them through. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=415.4s)]
*  We're looking forward to seeing Cash Patel as the next director of the FBI. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=418.36s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard is the next director of national intelligence. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=421.96s)]
*  I will be out at the CIA today with a new director Radcliffe. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  But as a former DNI, yes, a few days on the job, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=430.96s)]
*  but years and decades of experience that we're bringing to it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=435.88s)]
*  We're hitting the ground running and the president is all gas, no brakes right now. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=439.04s)]
*  So we've noticed. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=443.92s)]
*  So, Michael, you don't think that these hearings are going to be [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=445.24s)]
*  because of the, you know, the tragedy that just took place. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=448.28s)]
*  You don't think they're going to be delayed as a result of that? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=452.32s)]
*  Let me interrupt. I'm sorry about that. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=455.71999999999997s)]
*  Here's the mayor of Washington, D.C. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=457.88s)]
*  Uriel Bowser is about to have a press conference. Thanks, Michael. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=460.28s)]
*  to catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2bGuYxkc&t=468.88s)]
