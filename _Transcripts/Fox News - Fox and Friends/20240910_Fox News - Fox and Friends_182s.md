# McEnany: This is how Trump can end Kamala Harris' career
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA)
*  So hours from now, Trump is expected to take here as a task over her far-left agenda and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=0.0s)]
*  policy flip-flops. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=5.64s)]
*  Moments ago, her senior campaign spokesman had an interesting take on the no tax on tips. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=12.72s)]
*  He'll have to answer for some of his positions. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=13.72s)]
*  Why all of a sudden is he for no taxes on tips when his administration tried to take [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=16.52s)]
*  tips away from tip workers and give it to their bosses? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=23.48s)]
*  I mean, these are the kind of things that Donald Trump's going to have to answer for [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=25.92s)]
*  to explain to the country. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=29.54s)]
*  And I think he's going to have to figure out for just a few minutes during this debate [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=31.56s)]
*  whether he can talk about anything other than himself. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=35.379999999999995s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=38.22s)]
*  She steals his idea and then he has to explain it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=39.22s)]
*  Outnumbered co-host Kayleigh McEnany joins us now. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=41.86s)]
*  That is the Harris camp. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=44.78s)]
*  This is their position and your response is? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=45.78s)]
*  Here's what Ian Sams left out. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=48.34s)]
*  Not only did Kamala Harris copy no tax on tips, in 2022 she was the tie breaking vote [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=49.66s)]
*  policy to pursue workers for not paying taxes on tips. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=56.66s)]
*  And by the way, how is she going to explain voting against the wall and now all of a sudden [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=60.54s)]
*  being for the wall? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  That's an alternate reality and one I'm not familiar with that Ian Sams lives in. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=65.97999999999999s)]
*  He also was upset about the mute mic, but this was something that was negotiated by [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=69.17999999999999s)]
*  the Democratic Party and the Biden campaign. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=74.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=76.62s)]
*  And this is one of my favorite kind of twisted logics. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=77.62s)]
*  They say when you say Kamala, you got not a single vote in the primary. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=81.12s)]
*  They go, no, it was the Biden Harris campaign. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=83.9s)]
*  But then when you say, okay, well, you are subjected to the Biden Harris negotiated rules, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=86.78s)]
*  they say, no, that was the Biden campaign. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=90.62s)]
*  Can't have it both ways. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=92.38000000000001s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=93.38000000000001s)]
*  So Donald Trump is going to have a tough task today because she's going to try to make it [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=94.38000000000001s)]
*  all emotional. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=98.94000000000001s)]
*  She's trying to get under the skin already playing ads and all that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=99.94s)]
*  What should the former president do today? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=103.82000000000001s)]
*  So Donald Trump has three secret weapons. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=106.18s)]
*  He has a plan. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=108.62s)]
*  He has a record and he has the experience. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  If he is measured and methodical and describing his plan and his record with the experience [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=112.42s)]
*  as a seven time presidential debater, he will prevail. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  But here's how he can end Kamala Harris's political career as he did to Joe Biden's. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=119.86s)]
*  Be prepared because they have said we are going to needle him on women's issues. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=124.54s)]
*  Here's what you say. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=128.26s)]
*  You say, look, here's my childcare plan. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=129.26s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  It's on True Social. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  It's the Marco Rubio plan. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  Go look at it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=134.42000000000002s)]
*  Here's my school safety plan. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  By the way, will you encourage every Democrat to vote for safety officers in schools? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=136.46s)]
*  You said let's take police out of schools. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=140.16s)]
*  Finally, here is my plan for women, pregnant women, to empower them to make a real choice. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=142.7s)]
*  You're the party of choice. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  Let women choose to keep the baby they love by empowering them with paid family leave. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=148.38s)]
*  Here's my plan. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  Find it on True Social. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  You don't have one, Kamala. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  Kayleigh, I just realized I missed your props from when you were in the press room. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3mssVWKnA&t=156.14000000000001s)]
