# Ex-Secret Service agent slams handling of security at Trump shooting: 'Totally unacceptable'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds)
*  Richard Starapoli is a former Secret Service agent, did it for 25 years, he joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=0.0s)]
*  Richard, you've been on the presidential detail, guarded president. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=4.96s)]
*  Yes I have. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=9.28s)]
*  This new body cam, you've had a chance to review all this new body cam footage, they [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=10.28s)]
*  jumped up to try to look at the guy. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  What do you make of all this? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=14.68s)]
*  Well I'll tell you, I think the videos kind of speak for themselves, right? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=16.0s)]
*  You can clearly see what everyone's seeing, you can hear what everyone's hearing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=19.04s)]
*  What I think is more interesting is what no one's talking about, and that's what you don't [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  see and that's what you don't hear. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  In particular, where is everyone? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  The acting director testified before Congress that there were at least 70 Secret Service [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=30.68s)]
*  agents there, yet I don't see any of them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=34.48s)]
*  You also were supplemented by Homeland Security. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=37.4s)]
*  Where are these guys? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=40.0s)]
*  Where is the state police? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=41.16s)]
*  Where are all these people? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=42.72s)]
*  This is not Yosemite where you've got millions of acres of forested property, this is a relatively [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=43.72s)]
*  small event site, yet you're relying on one cop who doesn't even have a ladder to climb [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=48.3s)]
*  on top of this building after everyone at this place has told them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=53.68s)]
*  He's got a plastic chair right there, yeah. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  We've told him that there's somebody on the roof with a gun, yet where's his assets? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=59.31999999999999s)]
*  You also don't hear any radio traffic. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  What is going on with that? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  Where's the communications? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=68.2s)]
*  This was a total and complete cataclysmic breakdown of basic Secret Service policies [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=69.24s)]
*  and procedures. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=74.46s)]
*  There's no need for a review of any of this. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  How and why did that happen? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=78.24s)]
*  It happened for two reasons. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=79.46s)]
*  One, you have a lack of leadership and management at the senior-most levels. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=80.6s)]
*  That's at the director level and the assistant director level. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=84.16s)]
*  Over the course of the last three, four years specifically, assets were taken away from [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  President Trump because he was simply treated as a former president or as a routine candidate. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=92.2s)]
*  He is anything but that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=97.44000000000001s)]
*  If nothing else, in the last year, his social profile and the threat level has increased [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  dramatically. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=103.72s)]
*  The highest levels of the U.S. government, to include the President of the United States, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=104.72s)]
*  has likened former President Trump to Hitler, the Antichrist, and the greatest existential [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=108.76s)]
*  threat to democracy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  How do you not realize, particularly if you're the Secret Service in the threat business, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=115.32s)]
*  you don't realize that that's going to invoke the ire and the focus of every fringe lunatic [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=119.96s)]
*  in the world to take a shot at this guy, and you leave a building that's within football [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  throwing distance uncovered? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=130.01999999999998s)]
*  Totally unacceptable, totally negligent. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=132.48s)]
*  So you mentioned the director and the assistant director as one aspect. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=134.6s)]
*  What's the other aspect, just on the ground? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=137.6s)]
*  Well, the other aspect is the employee on the ground. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=138.84s)]
*  Where are all these guys? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  You've got a guy who handles the site, nowhere to be seen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=143.52s)]
*  You've got a site supervisor who's supposed to have experience and conduct a last walk [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  through to make sure everything's covered. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=149.72s)]
*  Where is this person? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=151.8s)]
*  None of these people have been produced to answer the most basic questions by the current [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=152.8s)]
*  leadership of the Secret Service. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=157.68s)]
*  For sure. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=158.96s)]
*  And then you've got guys on the ground. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=159.96s)]
*  I thought you were on the roof. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=160.96s)]
*  Weren't you on the roof? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=161.96s)]
*  Who was supposed to be on the roof? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=162.96s)]
*  Nobody's on the roof. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=163.96s)]
*  It's absolutely ridiculous. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=164.96s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=165.96s)]
*  Richard, thank you for your expertise. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=166.96s)]
*  Well, thank you, sir. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=167.96s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=168.96s)]
*  And for your service to the country. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=169.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNSRsAH40Ds&t=170.96s)]
