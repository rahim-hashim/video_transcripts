# US may have been 'compromised' by Iran, lawmaker warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM)
*  Meanwhile lawmakers demanding more answers after those classified documents were leaked here now to react is for the congressman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=0.0s)]
*  Michael waltz on Armed Services with his greenberry background waltz got a brand new book. It's called hard truths [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=7.46s)]
*  Hard truths think and lead like a green beret. It comes out today. Congratulations on that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=13.52s)]
*  First off on this we don't know if it was a leak and we don't know if it was a hack [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Does that concern you? I don't know which would be worse and what would concern me more [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=23.7s)]
*  that the National Geospatial Agency NGA which [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=28.98s)]
*  analyzes all of our imagery all of our [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=33.22s)]
*  Drone footage all of our satellites if that was hacked that's hugely concerning [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=36.18s)]
*  But I think it was much more likely a leak you have everything from Rob Malley [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=41.46s)]
*  Which was Obama and Biden's lead negotiator their lieutenants one of which is still sitting in the Pentagon [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=46.94s)]
*  I think we've been compromised in many ways by Iran, but we were spying on Iran [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=53.06s)]
*  Excuse me on Israel weren't right. So what was leading to us and tell us? Yeah, so the actual [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=58.339999999999996s)]
*  Documents that were leaked were basically us collecting on Israel's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=64.46s)]
*  preparation to hit Iran [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=69.34s)]
*  And I think that speaks volumes for the fact that the Israelis have stopped talking to us and I hope Brian [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=71.42s)]
*  That when Secretary of State Anthony Blinken got off the plane, he said number one. I'm sorry [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=77.62s)]
*  Number two BB net and bra for the leaks number two that you were right [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=83.58s)]
*  because have they [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=88.34s)]
*  Listen to us [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=90.25999999999999s)]
*  Nasrallah would still be alive [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=91.98s)]
*  Sinwar would still be alive Mugnea would still be alive and Hamas and Hezbollah would still be attacking Israel and more October [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=94.02s)]
*  7th would would be in the future even though the great night at all gave a speech you said he's in hiding right now because [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=102.24s)]
*  They could blow up a guest house with her Nia [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=107.46s)]
*  Hamas by Fisher was there who knows what they could do to him, but in the big picture [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=110.1s)]
*  But I want to kind of foot stomp that the ayatollah is in hiding right now [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=115.38s)]
*  Not because of Biden because of BB. That's how you establish deterrence and put your adversaries on the back foot [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  But this is not that vice president Harris came out and said time for a ceasefire [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=128.54s)]
*  I want this war to end you do not let your enemy get up and off the road. Yeah [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=131.94s)]
*  Well what she really is saying she just wants it off the headlines [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  Through November 5th just kind of make it go away [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=140.58s)]
*  And even if a ceasefire basically buys Hamas time and resets the clocks for another attack [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=143.82s)]
*  She wants it to go away. Why did you write hard truths? Well, these are the hard truths that I learned in combat [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=150.06s)]
*  You know green Berets are different unique in the world of special operations the Rangers and seals two bullets on a forehead [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=156.42000000000002s)]
*  Middle of the night like the Osama bin Laden raid we can do that, too [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=163.66s)]
*  But Brian we have to learn local languages we have to embed with guerrilla forces tribes militias [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=167.82s)]
*  And if we're doing our job, we'll have the local indigenous forces do it for us [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=173.42s)]
*  That takes a mindset of adaptability bottoms up leadership certainly takes resilience [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=179.89999999999998s)]
*  And I talk about the traits and all of my missions as a green beret and then how I'm applying it to the tribes of Washington [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4dB5ZzYCxM&t=184.78s)]
