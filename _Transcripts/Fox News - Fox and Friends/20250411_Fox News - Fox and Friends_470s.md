# BREAKING: China retaliates against Trump tariffs, says trade war 'will become a joke'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo)
*  Is brand-new China escalating the ongoing trade war with the u.s [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=0.0s)]
*  overnight Beijing announcing a [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=5.4s)]
*  125% tariff on us imports this is up from 84% duty that China announced on Wednesday [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=8.08s)]
*  So this has the White House clarified yesterday that the 20% [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=14.9s)]
*  Fentanyl tear will remain in effect bringing the total tear of on China to 145 [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=19.2s)]
*  Yeah, we did some bad math early, but now that's is the total China's Finance Ministry responding [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=24.72s)]
*  Saying quote even if the u.s continues to impose higher tariffs [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  It will no longer make economic sense and will become a joke in the history of world economy [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=33.0s)]
*  All right president she also saying today his country is not afraid their new [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=38.68s)]
*  125% tariff rate on u.s. Goods kicks in tomorrow and here we go [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=43.68s)]
*  So no one's backing off know what but the thing that obviously it's gonna affect us got it [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=48.44s)]
*  But when you realize how much China is hurting internally their marketing their housing market has collapsed [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  The stimulus money that they put in has not been affected [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=61.96s)]
*  They have a youth unemployment rate where kids are growing from college [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=65.2s)]
*  And they just don't want to work not opportunities available to the point where they're going back to the colleges saying if your students your graduates [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=68.56s)]
*  Don't get jobs. We're coming after you [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  That's how desperate they are and most of what they need now since they put they're great at producing things [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=77.6s)]
*  But would they need us to consume their things and if this if the price has become too high [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=82.6s)]
*  America naturally will start giving the Heisman to Chinese goods [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=88.8s)]
*  I think this has become the national security issue of our time as well Brian [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=92.24s)]
*  They hack us like crazy. They steal like crazy [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=96.96s)]
*  They knock off our products all the time and you really can't compete at the end of the day with slave labor [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=99.72s)]
*  We outlawed in this country for a reason and now we essentially buy the products from a different country [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=106.24s)]
*  That does the same thing right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=111.68s)]
*  We get a lot of computers a lot of phones a lot of toys from China [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=113.36s)]
*  But the president says this is he's optimistic. This was good news [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=116.32s)]
*  He said we're very close to doing one of these trade deals. Listen [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=119.76s)]
*  Well, I think it's very close but you know, we have to have a deal that we like we don't want a deal [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=131.88s)]
*  That's gonna be a bad deal or I could I could make every deal in one day if I wanted to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=136.12s)]
*  do this in all in one day, I could just say yes what we'll do and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=141.72s)]
*  I was saying to the people before to Scott mostly to Scott and Howard and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=145.6s)]
*  Some of the other people that work with us on the negotiations [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=153.32s)]
*  We'll have to see what happens at that time [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=159.2s)]
*  And they're saying a lot of things they're coming after their foreign minister [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=162.32s)]
*  The Chinese foreign minister says US is in defiance of global criticism [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=165.6s)]
*  Pitching itself against the rest of the world intimidation threats and blackmail are not the right way to engage China [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=168.73999999999998s)]
*  Now people have said that President Xi has come to power held power [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=174.22s)]
*  Consolidated power because he's known as a tough guy, right? So that's his whole persona [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=177.94s)]
*  I know it comes down to school yard politics and we usually use that say keep that in the Middle East [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  But we're seeing that now. So if you want to keep your population in check you make it believe you make him think that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=188.22s)]
*  You're in control where he says goes and you're gonna stand up to the behemoth with you the US [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=195.38000000000002s)]
*  Which makes me think they're not going to take a step back because that is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=200.34s)]
*  Their persona right now around the globe those people gonna suffer and I love the way that the president talks about this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=204.9s)]
*  He always says look I gotta be tough with China. I have to but me and the president are friends. He's a tough negotiator [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=210.34s)]
*  I got to do what's best for my people. He's gonna try to do what's best for his people [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=215.74s)]
*  But all I want is fairness. I don't want to get into a war with China [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  I just want what's fair to the United States and what's fair for China as well, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=222.26s)]
*  I don't think most Americans knew the deficit was so big between the two countries and that's what he's saying [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=226.54s)]
*  We're gonna stop paying y'all so much money until you start paying us just as much [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  We have Jameson Greer the US trade representative. You've seen him on TV. Yeah, he's big. He's gonna be on at 730 [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=235.94s)]
*  He's the one that's been in front of the Senate and the house [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=241.89999999999998s)]
*  Talking about all their smart and the cabinet met yesterday and the cabinet members started to share their latest developments [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=244.14s)]
*  This reminds it goes hand in hand with what you saw yesterday at the diner every woman saying I love that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=250.3s)]
*  President Trump's doing this and this and this and if you if you don't remember everything that he's done over the last hundred plus [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=254.78s)]
*  Days, here you go [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=261.34000000000003s)]
*  Within the next 24 hours you're going to be seen another huge arrest on a Tesla [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=264.14s)]
*  Dealership president and that that person will be looking at at least 20 years in prison with no negotiations for the second month in a row [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=270.78000000000003s)]
*  You have broken the record in the history of the nation for the lowest number of encounters at the border [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=279.1s)]
*  We anticipate savings in FY 26 from reduction of waste and fraud by 150 billion dollars [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=285.42s)]
*  and I mean and some of it is just absurd like people getting unemployment insurance who haven't been born yet [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=291.90000000000003s)]
*  I've had over a hundred people working around the clock to scan the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=298.62s)]
*  paper around RFK [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=303.26s)]
*  Senator Robert F. Kennedy's assassination as well as Martin Luther King jr's assassination by September [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=305.82s)]
*  We will know what has caused the autism epidemic and will be it will be able to eliminate those exposures [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=311.26s)]
*  That's incredible. I said about that. It'll be a hundred days on April 29th that last line [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=317.46s)]
*  We're gonna figure out by September. What has caused this autism epidemic? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=322.58s)]
*  We'll be able to know or tell America by then. Well, I mean that's huge promises no backing off that deadline [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=327.94s)]
*  One thing is, you know, they did update us. This is what President Trump wants to do. It's your government [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=333.24s)]
*  I'm gonna let you see what's happening. It went on for over an hour [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=337.76s)]
*  This is no better programming in the country than when President Trump gets his cabinet members together and or when he has these meetings [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=340.4s)]
*  Whether it's gun control or anything else bring the cameras in you'll see it in real time [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=347.59999999999997s)]

*  Transparency in this administration is just unmatched [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=358.4s)]
*  I mean that he wants the American public to see [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=360.84s)]
*  everything and this is not a [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=363.79999999999995s)]
*  Ceremonial cabinet they're working and they're telling the American people what they're doing. You can criticize them all day [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=366.23999999999995s)]
*  You may not like them personally whatever the Democrats want to throw at them, but they ran on agenda [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=372.56s)]
*  The president did he selected a cabinet they debate each other, but they're not backbiting [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=378.03999999999996s)]
*  I stabbing each other in the back [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=384.08s)]
*  They're duking it out in private and given the American people what they voted for [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I would say a couple of things it looks like we're getting Taiwan Japan South Korea of all [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  Talked about different things are gonna do. I think we're gonna start seeing deals being done [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=396.12s)]
*  It's got best and kind of talks about that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=399.8s)]
*  It's overwhelming to have 70 countries call you [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=401.56s)]
*  But the other thing I see is Amazon comes out and Amazon as a CEO comes it warns Americans [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=403.8s)]
*  Cheap prices on everyday goods could be a thing of the past. Okay, fine [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=408.44s)]
*  You know why because 75% of all your material everything you have on your website is China and we don't even know it doesn't say it [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=411.74s)]
*  A lot of them are knockoffs. You don't police it. You just put it out there say the American people aren't complaining [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=418.44s)]
*  You know who's complaining the entrepreneurs. I was talking to Artie Lee the creator of life back [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=423.1s)]
*  He says that he finds out he pioneers as he gets a patent spends all this money gets all his clearances [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=427.14s)]
*  He creates up in the morning and China knocked off his product and it looks exactly like his on Amazon listed right next to it [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=432.9s)]
*  He goes to our trade representative. They go. Yeah, we have this problem all the time, but they don't listen to our court decisions [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=439.78s)]
*  They don't listen to our court. How long are we gonna put up with this? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=445.14s)]
*  This thing is fundamentally no matter what the rate is. We are built. We're built to lose this [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=448.65999999999997s)]
*  Europe is built to lose this battle. How much longer we're gonna be punching bags. That's not fair. I'm Steve juicy [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkKXghV2QNo&t=454.5s)]
