# BREAKING: Deported MS-13 suspect previously faced domestic violence allegations
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg)
*  All right, let's get started. I cannot believe this we begin with a tale of two parties [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=0.0s)]
*  Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen decides to go to El Salvador in hopes of bringing back a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=4.84s)]
*  Suspected MS 13 gang member who has also been accused of beating his wife [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=11.36s)]
*  So while the Democrats fight on the behalf of that deported illegal immigrant the Trump administration [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=15.8s)]
*  invites angel mom Patty more into the White House more in sharing the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=20.68s)]
*  Heartbreaking story and a lot of details of her daughter's murder at the hands of an illegal migrant in Vaughn [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=25.18s)]
*  And Van Hollen State in Maryland Griff Jenkins is live in Washington with more. Hey Griff [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=31.66s)]
*  Yeah, good morning and you're right Ainsley heartbreaking and you're right Brian [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=37.46s)]
*  There are two sides to this story [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=40.86s)]
*  But Lauren's one sobering moment at the White House last night really captured to start a reminder of the deadly [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=42.46s)]
*  consequences of open border policies as President Trump recognized Patty mourn [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  Patty stand up, Patty [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=53.9s)]
*  Please [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=57.059999999999995s)]
*  Incredible daughter and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  Her daughter's looking down on Patty today. This was some day for you and we appreciate it Patty [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=67.22s)]
*  And we're all with you 100% and you are indeed an angel mom [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  Earlier in the day Patty joined reporters in the briefing room recounting her daughter's last moments [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=78.17999999999999s)]
*  There wasn't one inch of her body that didn't have some kind of injury whether it's bruising [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=83.82s)]
*  Broken bones [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=91.1s)]
*  Contusions the scratches. Why are we not protecting the American citizens? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=92.69999999999999s)]
*  It's just common sense. Why are we not protecting our children? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  This is Maryland Democrat senator Chris Van Hollen advocated for his illegal alien constituent down in El Salvador I [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  Said I'm not asking him to smuggle. Mr. Abrego Garcia in the United States [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=111.2s)]
*  I'm simply asking him to open the door of CICOT and let this innocent man walk out. They should let him go [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=115.82000000000001s)]
*  But newly surfaced court records show Abrego Garcia's wife filed domestic violence allegations against her husband [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=124.0s)]
*  However, she's now changing her tune telling Newsweek quote after suffer after surviving domestic violence in a previous relationship [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=131.04s)]
*  I acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmore by seeking a civil protective order in case things escalated [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=138.92s)]
*  Things did not escalate and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  But the White House says Abrego Garcia is not welcome here [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=151.2s)]
*  If he ever ends up back in the United States, he would immediately be deported again [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  Nothing will change the fact that Abrego Garcia will never be a Maryland father [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=161.44s)]
*  He will never live in the United States of America again [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  And now we're watching to see if more Democrats will follow Van Hollen down to El Salvador guys [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=169.38s)]
*  Just fascinating stuff Griff. I always thought when it comes to illegal immigration [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=177.0s)]
*  If you have a green card, for example, upstanding citizen you get a DWI you get in a bar fight you've gone [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=181.45999999999998s)]
*  This guy is under in front of a judge they say two judges said MS 13 and then he gets to domestic violence [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=187.38s)]
*  He gets a domestic violence charge chronicled in great teadeals by his wife. She was fearing for her life [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=194.98s)]
*  How does he even stay here a day knowing that his status was it was was in jeopardy anyway? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=201.82s)]
*  Well, that's a great question Brian and that really highlights just the difference in approach to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=208.18s)]
*  Enforcement of existing laws on our books from the previous administration to this one [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=215.02s)]
*  this administration says if you're here illegally and certainly if you have a reason to be a [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=220.54s)]
*  Danger to the community you will not remain here and you will be sent home and should [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=226.26s)]
*  Democrats like Van Hollen succeed in getting Abrego Garcia back to the US. He would go immediately back into [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=232.5s)]
*  Immigration judicial proceedings and all of this would come right back up. That's why Caroline Levitt says he'd be sent packing again [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=239.82s)]
*  All right. Thank you so much. Griff. Not only is this guy here illegally. He's part of MS 13 [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=247.66s)]
*  So he's a terrorist. He also is being accused by his wife of beating her. This is what court records show [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=253.5s)]
*  This is what she wrote in her own filings [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=260.0s)]
*  Repeatedly beat her and at this point she writes I am afraid to be close to him. I have multiple photos and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=262.86s)]
*  Videos of how violent he can be in all the bruises [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=269.09999999999997s)]
*  He's left me and another one she writes on a different day got angry again started yelling rip shirt and shorts off before [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=271.76s)]
*  grabbing her arm and leaving marks then [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=278.98s)]
*  Recalling that he hit her twice in 2020 [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=281.74s)]
*  Said he hit me in the eye leaving a purple eye and he hit me with his work boot [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=284.65999999999997s)]
*  So Ainsley just went through the domestic violence and so I'm not gonna relitigate that because you just said it in detail [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  Laptop she laptop and she also said that she had photos and videos as well [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=295.9s)]
*  Two new things came out as well yesterday when the Department of Justice released the filing they detailed what the immigration judge said [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=300.5s)]
*  So he said that you know these allegations against me in this 13 aren't true [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=308.06s)]
*  The court said that the person the confidential source was credible and they also said something else [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=312.52s)]
*  They decided to deny his [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=317.78s)]
*  Removal because they said that he'd even show up for his traffic tickets and they just didn't believe him [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=320.22s)]
*  He said the court said even if it's based on hearsay the game validation was supported by reliable sources and corroborated by the police [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=325.22s)]
*  observation [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=333.54s)]
*  And then the next thing that came out yesterday was from the Tennessee Star [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=335.54s)]
*  They know a traffic stop that happened in 2022. He was transporting seven passengers from Texas to Maryland [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=339.34000000000003s)]
*  They called the FBI to come to the scene to evaluate that the FBI refused to send anyone there [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=347.34s)]
*  They said to take pictures of the folks that were involved [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=353.34s)]
*  And they essentially let him go, but it was a two-hour traffic stop [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=357.34s)]
*  extra police officer that is known for conducting these type of reviews, so I [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=362.34s)]
*  Can't wait to hear from the FBI on that. So now we have the wife [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=369.34s)]
*  We have the DOJ filing and now apparently he was trafficking humans across the border [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=372.34s)]
*  I just hope cash Patel's FBI would not allow somebody after a good to extensive questioning with [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=376.34s)]
*  Legals in the car to get away. Yeah, knowing that he's on a removal order anyway knowing if you look at his background [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=381.34s)]
*  He's suspected of being MS 13 and they're looking at his case [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=387.34s)]
*  How about adding this not only domestic violence and his wife currently now with a go fund me page? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=391.34s)]
*  Was a very fearful life when he was arrested he was found with rolls of cash [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=398.34s)]
*  That's right and drugs also. He had the insignia of MS 13 and he was wearing the Bulls paraphernalia [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=402.34s)]
*  You might think what's the big deal? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=409.34s)]
*  That is what they wear the Jordan era bull stuff that they wear to almost feel like a uniform [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=411.34s)]
*  Which is basically an in-your-face try to arrest me [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=417.34s)]
*  So this guy should have been deported when he was born [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=420.34s)]
*  This guy should have been deported when he was picked up at Home Depot years ago years ago [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=424.34s)]
*  He survives the 2019 appearances and then he survives the stopover in 2022 [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=429.34s)]
*  And then he survives two domestic violence incidents at which time his wife currently goes into great detail about his violent behavior [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=435.34s)]
*  So for anyone who thinks that Senator Van Hollen did a great thing for America [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=443.34s)]
*  Did anything short of embarrassing himself and his state by going over to San Salvador and trying to get him out and talk to him [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=449.34s)]
*  Or Cory Booker who's getting another team together to go over there next week [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=456.34s)]
*  Think about that as opposed to in the same state where Rachel Moran had to endear [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=460.34s)]
*  Yes, endure so that senator represents Rachel Moran's family, right? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=466.34s)]
*  They all live in Maryland and last night the Trump officials were taking CNN and MSNBC to task [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=471.34s)]
*  Over their refusal to cover Patty Moran's remarks [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=477.34s)]
*  Instead they were covering Bernie Sanders rally and they were talking about Gavin Newsom and the NBA [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=480.34s)]
*  This is an important story. This is a woman who lost her daughter and is invited to the White House to speak [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=486.34s)]
*  Then look at look at the coverage on ABC CBS and NBC during the trial where the guy the illegal guy who killed Rachel Moran was just convicted [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=492.34s)]
*  Zero minutes of broadcasting her trial on those three networks 64 minutes covering a brego Garcia's [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=502.34s)]
*  Deportion deportation. This is April 1st through April 15 [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=509.34s)]
*  So let me just factor in something else the actual story that she told was so breath-takingly brutal and detail [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=515.3399999999999s)]
*  It was that America needs to understand that a woman mom of five who goes jogging should be able to come home in a path [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=523.3399999999999s)]
*  Their family always walked out together and couldn't feel safer [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=530.34s)]
*  She had plans to go out to dinner with her family and she's a grandmother [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=534.34s)]
*  I'll add a couple of things she went over in brutal detail that there was not one portion of her body that was not a bruised or scraped [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=537.34s)]
*  Or broken or broken. She had the most horrific death possible because an illegal alien was not deported [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=546.34s)]
*  Multiple times who came here with a track record of being a criminal and a thug got through no regrets [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=553.34s)]
*  No apologies for eight million that came here and a 2.5 million that came here with criminal records [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=560.34s)]
*  This guy was a gotaway by the administration did two things right? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=567.34s)]
*  First of all, they put more information out the Department of Justice and we're learning the new information from Tennessee and we see what happened with the mess about [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=570.34s)]
*  The second thing is bringing Patty out there it put the it put the problem back into content it got the American people [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=576.34s)]
*  Back on messes on why they overwhelmingly support deportation [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=583.34s)]
*  But what if you didn't watch if you didn't what if you were hearing about the NBA playoffs? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=589.34s)]
*  And the thing is it's just if you want an example of two different Americas and get the whole common sense our Republican or Democrat [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBI957r0mLg&t=592.34s)]
