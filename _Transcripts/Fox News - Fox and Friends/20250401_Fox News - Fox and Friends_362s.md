# 17 felon migrant suspects deported to El Salvador under Title 8 authority
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY)
*  The Trump administration uses its Title 8 authority to deport more violent criminal migrants to El Salvador's prison. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=0.0s)]
*  Among them, seven Aled Trindade Agua members plus one of the gang leaders. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=6.74s)]
*  Six are implicated in sexual abuse of a minor and three suspected murderers. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=11.18s)]
*  Borders are time, Homan joins us now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=16.6s)]
*  Tom, welcome back to the program. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=19.12s)]
*  You guys promised that you were going to do this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=21.2s)]
*  These folks were under final deportation order. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=23.2s)]
*  This is why you were able to get rid of them quickly, right? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=27.1s)]
*  Yeah, like I said last week when we talked, Lawrence, I said, despite what Judge Broseberg says, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=29.74s)]
*  we're going to continue to arrest members of MS-13 in Trindade Agua and remove them under Title 8. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=36.94s)]
*  We'll hold off on the Alien and Enemies Act, but that's all being litigated, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=42.3s)]
*  but we're going to take these people off the street every day 24-7 across this country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  We're not letting up. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=50.379999999999995s)]
*  You know, Tom, I want to get back to that final deportation order, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=51.58s)]
*  because some of these cases are taking years to get through. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=55.5s)]
*  Is there any way to speed up the process to get that final deportation order? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=58.3s)]
*  Look, we're looking at expatriated removals, looking at voluntary return, but you know, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=66.38s)]
*  EOAR, the immigration courts, need to reestablish last cases first, right? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=71.25999999999999s)]
*  Those immediate cases that came across the border, litigate them first, but [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=79.17999999999999s)]
*  immigration judges, we need more immigration judges. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=82.78s)]
*  I think more action on the most violent first, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  Let's concentrate on the criminal aliens, but under the current structure, those who are in [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=91.1s)]
*  detention get a hearing within like 40 days. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  If you're not in detention, it could take five to seven years. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=98.53999999999999s)]
*  So we need to make sure ICE continues doing what they're doing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=101.5s)]
*  Focus on the public safety threats, national security threats, lock them up, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=104.86s)]
*  detain them, because they get attention first. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  So we've got to expand on what we're currently doing and put more bad guys in detention, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=110.78s)]
*  have the hearings done quickly. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=114.94s)]
*  So in the final days, Tom, the past administration tried to extend TPS. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=116.7s)]
*  So the administration got rid of it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=121.66s)]
*  Your administration under Donald Trump's leadership got rid of it quickly. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  A federal judge is disagreeing with this, but it's the reasoning that got me. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=126.62s)]
*  This is what he said in his ruling. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=131.18s)]
*  There's no evidence that Venezuelan TPS holders are members of the TDA gang, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=132.94s)]
*  have connections to the gang, and or commit crimes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=138.86s)]
*  Generalization of criminality to the Venezuelan TPS population as a whole is baseless and smacks [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=141.74s)]
*  racism predicated on generalized false stereotypes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=147.82000000000002s)]
*  The administration didn't bring stereotypes to the court. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=152.86s)]
*  That's not the reason for getting rid of TPS. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=156.38s)]
*  So what is this judge talking about? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  Look, it's another activist judge making a stupid ruling. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=163.42000000000002s)]
*  It just doesn't make sense. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=167.26000000000002s)]
*  I've been around since 1984, Lawrence, and a TPS, Temporary Protective Status, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=169.02s)]
*  is never temporary. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=174.3s)]
*  And President Trump is going to do his job by rule of law. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=175.74s)]
*  The law says temporary status. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=180.14s)]
*  Once the conditions in that country they're from, once the conditions change, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=181.66s)]
*  then people should be removed from the United States. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=186.78s)]
*  It's only a temporary status. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=189.26s)]
*  For instance, if there's a hurricane and it devastates a part of a country, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=190.7s)]
*  we'll give them TPS until that country gets back on their feet. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=194.62s)]
*  But TPS isn't meant to be decades long. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=197.82s)]
*  So President Trump, who's promised the American people, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  we're going to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and signed by the President. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=203.57999999999998s)]
*  We're going to use the laws of this country to secure the border and enforce our immigration law. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=206.54s)]
*  That's exactly what we're doing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=210.62s)]
*  TPS needs to be temporary in nature. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  We need to follow the rule of law and not some advice from an activist judge [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  who makes the foolish ruling not based on law but based on opinion. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=219.34s)]
*  If you look at that decision, it's based on opinion, not the rule of law. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=223.82000000000002s)]
*  And that's what we need to get back to. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=227.74s)]
*  So look, we'll litigate it and we'll appeal it and we'll win. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=228.94s)]
*  Meanwhile, Tom, the Rochester Police Department is under a lot of scrutiny [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=233.18s)]
*  because they got an officer assist call from ICE and they showed up for the call. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=236.62s)]
*  This is what their union is saying, Tom. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=241.5s)]
*  Let's watch it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=243.10000000000002s)]
*  Our policy is also to back up other officers who need help. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=245.26000000000002s)]
*  We report on this all the time about an officer killed during a traffic stop [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=248.94s)]
*  is one of the most dangerous times for an officer to have. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=252.86s)]
*  You have a vehicle that the occupants are refusing to get out. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=256.7s)]
*  It was a van. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=259.90000000000003s)]
*  Turns out there was eight people in that van. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=261.1s)]
*  And our officers did an excellent job of deescalating that situation. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=263.5s)]
*  Tom, aren't you proud of those law enforcement officers for doing their job? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=268.38s)]
*  Answering the call? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=271.98s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=274.3s)]
*  And I met some of those officers at a law enforcement rally down in Tennessee [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=275.18s)]
*  and I told them I'm coming to Rochester. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=280.54s)]
*  I promised them I'd come to Rochester and address the issue. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=282.38s)]
*  Now, I have been told just recently that the leadership at Borbacheaux and HSI [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=285.1s)]
*  have met with the chief and they're going to continue to respond to emergency calls. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=289.98s)]
*  But I made a promise I'm going to go. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=293.98s)]
*  I'm going to go. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=295.98s)]
*  I think the issue lies with the mayor of Rochester who supports [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=296.86s)]
*  sanctuary city policies and took this action. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=300.06s)]
*  Those officers that responded were put on a death, taken off the road because of those actions. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=302.86s)]
*  I think what I've heard is the chief police has had a conversation with both Borbacheaux and HSI. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=309.5s)]
*  But I made a promise to those law enforcement officers I go to Rochester [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=315.58s)]
*  and that's exactly what I'm going to do. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=319.1s)]
*  I keep my promises. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=320.7s)]
*  Yeah, Tom. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=321.9s)]
*  I mean, we were dealing with lunatics right now. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=322.62s)]
*  When you get a call on the radio saying officer assist, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=324.86s)]
*  this is standard operating procedure. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=328.38s)]
*  You show up no matter what jurisdiction. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=329.98s)]
*  It's all lights and sirens coming to aid the officer. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=332.14s)]
*  We'll see what happens, Tom. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=335.9s)]
*  Yeah, and that's exactly what responded to that story. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=337.65999999999997s)]
*  It says cops need to respond to cops in emergency situations. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=340.38s)]
*  Borbacheaux and ISIS never, never, never not responded to a call for assistance from law enforcement. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  Tom Holman, thank you, brother. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNxNegSDfY&t=349.18s)]
