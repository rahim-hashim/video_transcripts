# Attorney says Laken Riley verdict could ‘come down’ in 24 hours
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg)
*  Tomorrow morning the trial for the illegal immigrant accused of murdering Georgia nursing student Lake and Riley is set to resume [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=0.0s)]
*  It comes as prosecutors reveal chilling details painting the suspect as a killer [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=7.32s)]
*  Hunting for females before targeting Riley in a struggle that lasted eight [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=12.44s)]
*  18 long minutes. Yeah Fox News contributor and retired NYPD inspector Paul Morrow [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=18.2s)]
*  Will be covering the trial live from Georgia all week and he joins us now. Thank you for joining us Paul [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=23.46s)]
*  We've gotten a day or two of trial. It's been very public. What have we learned so far? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=29.200000000000003s)]
*  Well, the evidence is quite compelling [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=35.56s)]
*  And a lot of that evidence was challenged by the defense because they knew it was going to be so [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=38.08s)]
*  Dispositive you've got DNA evidence that is from skin scrapings that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=43.36s)]
*  That are word collected from underneath [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Lakin's fingernails that go to Ibarra's DNA have a thumbprint from Ibarra because [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=51.48s)]
*  one of the plastic gloves that he [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=57.6s)]
*  Allegedly wore had a hole in the thumb got a video that appears to show him [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=61.0s)]
*  Discarding clothing in a dumpster you have the phone forensics [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=67.4s)]
*  You really have a narrative that demonstrates his day that day including an earlier incident where he was allegedly a peeping Tom [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=72.24s)]
*  Again, he's innocent until proven guilty [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  We recognize that but the prosecution at this point has really created a very compelling narrative of how he might have done what he did [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  And what happened to Lake and Riley that morning? I mean, that's a lot of circumstantial evidence [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=90.44s)]
*  I think it's very clear to most of us what he did [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=95.28s)]
*  Tells you know the family obviously wanting justice wanting this man to be put behind jail behind bars for forever [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  If not executed [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=104.08s)]
*  But what else do they want I mean, I'm sure that this issue of the border [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=106.16s)]
*  Has really is really at the center of this, right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=111.24s)]
*  Yeah, it really is, you know [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=115.24s)]
*  The entry of Jose Ibarra into the country is a little bit murky [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=117.36s)]
*  I solicited him as a gotaway, but there was early reporting that he actually had a sponsor [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=122.36s)]
*  I actually contacted the alleged sponsor. They deny it [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  so it looks like he may have presented at the border as [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=129.74s)]
*  somebody who was coming in under the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=133.36s)]
*  Well-known chnv program at this point Cuba Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=135.68s)]
*  Which allows for expedited processing if you have a sponsor [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=139.84s)]
*  He then just seems to have left the system left the processing and come into America. He gets arrested in New York [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=143.84s)]
*  He gets arrested as well down in Georgia [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  He's actually out with a warrant on him when he's ultimately arrested for this crime [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=152.96s)]
*  so it becomes an [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  unfortunate but [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  Iconic event because it really put on the radar screen for America in an undeniable way [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=161.68s)]
*  That we had a real problem at the border and that we were importing not just garden variety criminals here [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=167.68s)]
*  But members of criminal gangs who were really committed to doing whatever they wanted whenever they wanted in this case the gang being [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=174.08s)]
*  Tren de Aragua from Venezuela [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=180.56s)]
*  Well, as we mentioned Paul, you're gonna be live in Athens, Georgia all week long covering the trial of Lake and Riley [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=182.56s)]
*  I watched a little bit last week Paul [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=187.16s)]
*  It's pretty overwhelming evidence against Jose Ibarra a fairly technical [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=190.16s)]
*  To the level of being weak defense of Jose Ibarra as we go into this week and we'll be watching you on Fox [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=195.16s)]
*  What are you gonna be watching for in trial this week? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=200.56s)]
*  So as we know there's a bench trial going on he chose not to have a jury [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=204.44s)]
*  Generally you do that because you have a very technical defense [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=208.56s)]
*  You know, you're not gonna get a whole lot of sympathy in the jurisdiction. That's what he seems to have calculated here [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=212.16s)]
*  So he seems to be playing upon that is his defense team as well seems to be playing on the idea that there is the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  Possibility that his brother Diego is actually the perp Diego was wearing the hat that they feel was actually [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  You warned by the suspect during the event the next morning they pick up Diego [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=231.76s)]
*  He has the hat on and so the defense seems to have seized upon that fact to try to create a counter narrative [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  That it was in fact the brother and they're saying that the DNA is not this positive don't trust it [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=243.26s)]
*  It's only a computer talking to you. And in fact, it could have been the brother [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  It is reasonable doubt and so you can't convict the problem for Jose [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=252.73999999999998s)]
*  Is that the judge does not seem inclined towards him in any way with this evidence? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=257.02s)]
*  He's ruled against the defense in every defense motion to suppress the evidence [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=261.18s)]
*  All this evidence is coming in against Jose and so I'm gonna be looking for a frankly a pretty quick adjudication [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=265.46s)]
*  This thing may even come down Monday. Oh, wow. Okay. We'll be watching Paul. Thank you so much. I'm Steve juicy [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRcoe5V0DZg&t=271.5s)]
