# Liberal state reverses law after 'staggering' effects
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI)
*  Oregon has made drug possession a crime once again after a failed attempt at decriminalization in 2020. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=0.0s)]
*  The new law makes possession for personal use a misdemeanor and gives tougher penalties for selling drugs in public. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Oregon House Republican leader and retired Portland Police Sergeant Jeff Helfridge joins us now. Good morning to you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=14.64s)]
*  Good morning, Ashley. How are you doing today? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=21.44s)]
*  I'm doing great. Thank you. So why the change? Is it because you saw the problem get worse after it was decriminalized in 2020? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=23.44s)]
*  You know, the recriminalization was the first step in many that needed to happen. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  And it's because you saw overdose deaths, you saw drug usage on the street, crime, homelessness, all soared after Democrats put this policy in place. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  They could have stopped it, but they didn't. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=43.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=45.2s)]
*  As a sergeant, I used to see this all the time and on the street, it was never like this before. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Jeff, when you look at the numbers, they're staggering. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=50.63999999999999s)]
*  After the law was passed in 2020, we saw an increase in March of that year, 2021 of 104 percent. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=53.279999999999994s)]
*  Then the next year, an increase of another 51 percent. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=62.16s)]
*  Then the increase last year in 2023, it was an additional almost 24 percent. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=65.12s)]
*  So and we don't have the numbers, obviously, for the rest of this year. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=71.56s)]
*  But obviously, these liberal laws are failing the citizens there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=74.48s)]
*  More families are missing someone during the holidays. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=78.72s)]
*  Someone around their dinner table is not there because of drug use. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=82.16s)]
*  Absolutely. And unfortunately, because we decriminalized it for so for those four those few years, you have created we've lost a generation, I believe, of people because of these drugs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  And you don't get to have those times anymore. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=97.52s)]
*  And people can't even go into public and take their kids to the park because they're dealing with the death. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  They're dealing with drug use, dealing with all those bad things that are happening. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=104.96s)]
*  And this is just horrible policies. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=107.92s)]
*  And it's unfortunate that you have these mega donors around the nation that use Oregon as a petri dish, an experiment to try to create this world of utopia. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=109.92s)]
*  And you can't do it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  We need more Republicans charged to fix this problem. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=120.72s)]
*  Yeah, the voters passed it back in 2020 at 58 percent. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=122.88s)]
*  But now if you're caught with fentanyl, if you're caught with heroin or meth, small amounts, you're charged with possession or you can opt into this treatment program. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=126.48s)]
*  What are those programs like? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=134.24s)]
*  Is it like you go in a room, you watch a video slap on the wrist and you get to leave? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=135.36s)]
*  Or is it a true rehabilitation? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=139.6s)]
*  It's if you're in Portland, I think it's the unicorns and rainbows where you take somebody to this facility. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=142.96s)]
*  They opt in to say, I want treatment and they can walk away. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  We had a proposal that required mandatory treatment and to avoid jail. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=154.16000000000003s)]
*  And we voted to recriminalize it, but we had a better bill to put forward. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=158.96s)]
*  But my Democratic colleagues wouldn't listen to it and didn't want to deal with it because they were listening to the mega donors that were pushing this bad policy. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=163.68s)]
*  All right, Jeff, thank you so much for coming on with us. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=171.84s)]
*  Thanks for having me on. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=174.72000000000003s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8vsHy1vwtI&t=177.04000000000002s)]
