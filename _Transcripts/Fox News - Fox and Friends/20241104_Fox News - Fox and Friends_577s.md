# Bret Baier breaks down race to White House: 'We haven't seen anything like this'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA)
*  Well, we're here on the couch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=0.0s)]
*  We're actually in Studio M, which is a timeshare, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=1.36s)]
*  because during the morning, we do this show. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=4.4s)]
*  And then tonight, Brett Baer, the anchor [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=6.96s)]
*  and executive editor of Special Report, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=9.0s)]
*  takes over with the special coverage. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Same positioning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=12.6s)]
*  Pretty much exactly. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=13.96s)]
*  We just swap out a couch for a big desk. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=15.0s)]
*  A big desk. Big plastic desk. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=16.84s)]
*  Good to see you guys. Yeah, good to see you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=18.04s)]
*  I know you threw this hat to your panel yesterday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=21.36s)]
*  I mean, there's times when you have to be like a laser [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=22.2s)]
*  with your questions. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=24.52s)]
*  Other times, there's so many smart people, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=25.36s)]
*  so many experienced people that don't really know [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=28.0s)]
*  what is next or have never seen anything quite like this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=31.52s)]
*  We haven't seen anything like this, being this tight. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=34.52s)]
*  I did say last night on the panel, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  I know it's going to be either really, really close [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=39.92s)]
*  or Harris is running away with it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=44.84s)]
*  or it's a Trump landslide. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=46.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  I want to go with the record. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=48.36s)]
*  We'll have it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=49.68s)]
*  I think you've covered all the bases. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=51.36s)]
*  So let's talk about Nikki Haley. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=52.2s)]
*  She's on board, at least in print, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  in the Wall Street Journal. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=55.28s)]
*  One of the Trump officials told me they like this better [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=56.68s)]
*  than a joint appearance. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=59.2s)]
*  The headline is Trump isn't perfect, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=60.68s)]
*  but he's the better choice. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  And she gets specific from domestic policy to foreign policy. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=63.64s)]
*  Does this go a long way? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=67.12s)]
*  I think it does. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=68.24s)]
*  I think it does with a, especially a Wall Street Journal [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=69.12s)]
*  reading maybe a Nikki Haley following voter [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=72.12s)]
*  who hasn't decided. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=76.4s)]
*  Understand that I don't think there are many [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=77.36s)]
*  who haven't decided. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=79.32s)]
*  Peggy Noonan said there's undeclareds, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=80.28s)]
*  but maybe they've decided. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=82.84s)]
*  I think there are smaller and smaller groups [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=84.8s)]
*  of people who haven't come to the decision. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=88.24s)]
*  It's just whether they're gonna be motivated [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=90.52s)]
*  to vote on Tuesday or not. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=92.2s)]
*  80 million people will have voted. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=93.88s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=95.64s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  Do you think there are more, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=97.52s)]
*  have you heard there are a lot of voters [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=98.88s)]
*  that are just not going to vote [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=100.28s)]
*  because they don't like either candidate? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  I haven't heard that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=103.6s)]
*  I've heard a lot of motivation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=104.44s)]
*  And both sides think that they are really stirring up [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  their base. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=108.96s)]
*  They, you know, I've talked to both sides about ground game [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  and there is an equal thought about it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=113.28s)]
*  Democrats traditionally have a better ground game [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=115.44s)]
*  so they feel confident about it, but. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=117.6s)]
*  Republicans have done a great job this year though. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=121.28s)]
*  With Elon Musk and others. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=123.08s)]
*  Yeah, in fact I was just talking to one of the people [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=124.4s)]
*  who is involved on the Republican side [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=127.08s)]
*  in the get out the vote tomorrow. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=129.28s)]
*  And he was telling me that, you know, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=132.76s)]
*  the Republican early voting is much better [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=134.24s)]
*  than it was in 2020, obviously. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=136.84s)]
*  Now it all comes down to if they can get out the vote. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=139.2s)]
*  And he's cautiously optimistic, but at the same time, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  the Democrat machine is really good at it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=146.6s)]
*  So I think there's two things to watch. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=150.04s)]
*  One is the gender gap that we've already seen [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  and how does that play out versus men, women, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  and how it breaks down. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=156.0s)]
*  We'll see some of that early in the night [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=157.48s)]
*  to be able to tell us if it matches what we're seeing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  And then the second thing, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  and there's the wide gender gap, 57-40, 58-41. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=163.6s)]
*  The NBC, but it's 18-16, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  so there's more men voting for Trump [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=168.48s)]
*  than there are women voting for Harris. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=170.32s)]
*  There are more women who traditionally vote. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  So you're all in Georgia, too. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=174.0s)]
*  And then independence. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=175.76s)]
*  There's this independent bunch that's already voted. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  How are they breaking? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=180.0s)]
*  You know, if they're breaking for Harris, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=181.2s)]
*  that means something. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  If not, I personally think [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  we're gonna be in for a long night. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  You do. A long night or a long week? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=189.04s)]
*  No, I hope not a long week. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  Brett, tell me the states that make you think [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  it's gonna be a long night, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=195.76s)]
*  and not so much close, but how they do things. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=196.68s)]
*  Yeah, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=198.56s)]
*  they don't start counting until the polls close, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=201.52s)]
*  and they did not pass the law to do that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=205.96s)]
*  So I talked to Governor Shapiro. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=207.84s)]
*  He said they're gonna count through the night. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=209.68s)]
*  Nobody's stopping, but they start opening the envelopes [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=211.12s)]
*  when the polls close. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=215.08s)]
*  And it actually could come down to Pennsylvania. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  Someone I talked to said, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=217.84s)]
*  it looks like Donald Trump will win [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=219.12s)]
*  North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=220.76s)]
*  and a good shot in Nevada. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=222.44s)]
*  That means he would only have to win one of those three, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=224.0s)]
*  Pennsylvania, Michigan, or Wisconsin. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=226.84s)]
*  But Kamala Harris would have to win all three of those. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=229.12s)]
*  And you look at it in the margin of error, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  each one of those states, I mean, right now, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=234.8s)]
*  heading into today, the real clear politics average [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=237.32s)]
*  of the recent polls had him up 0.3% in Pennsylvania. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=240.12s)]
*  Right. 0.2% in Wisconsin. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=244.36s)]
*  Now he's up, but it's all within the margin. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=246.72s)]
*  Right, and you know, every swing state [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=248.72s)]
*  is within the margin of error, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=251.24s)]
*  and there's an item today in the New York Times, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=252.6s)]
*  and the Washington Post as well, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  talks about how given past polling errors, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=256.96s)]
*  we don't know what polling error they're gonna make tomorrow, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=260.4s)]
*  but there probably will be one. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  One candidate could actually sweep the swing states. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=265.0s)]
*  And when you look at how all of the polls are bunched up, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=268.28s)]
*  people are going, what's up with that? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  Are they just covering their bets [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  because they don't wanna say, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  hey, it was too close, we couldn't call it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  They could call it, but they're not? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=279.47999999999996s)]
*  New York Times Sienna, at the bottom of that poll, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=281.24s)]
*  we couldn't get a lot of white Republicans to answer [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=284.68s)]
*  less than we had in 2020, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  so we might be undercounting Mr. Trump again. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=290.12s)]
*  And that was like in the small print. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=292.92s)]
*  And I think that that's where we are. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=294.32s)]
*  You know, when I asked Mark Penn on the panel last night, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=296.8s)]
*  who do you wanna be? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=298.8s)]
*  Who would you rather be? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=299.92s)]
*  And he said Donald Trump, which I was surprised. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, he's the Democratic pollster. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=303.92s)]
*  Alex Castellanos, Karl Rove, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  they all had different things to say, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=308.68s)]
*  but I think that they feel like the Trump folks [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=310.88s)]
*  are in a good spot. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=313.4s)]
*  Couple of things. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=314.23999999999995s)]
*  Axios today called her the no-comment candidate [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  because she had a chance to weigh in on crime [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=318.32s)]
*  with that Proposition 36 out in California. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=320.64s)]
*  And so where did you vote? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=322.84s)]
*  Did you vote to reform criminal justice in California? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  I really don't wanna put my hand on the scale. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  When you asked her, we rolled that clip in, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=328.79999999999995s)]
*  when you asked her about, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=331.0s)]
*  where do you stand on transgender surgeries [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=332.2s)]
*  for prisoners who are legal immigrants? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=335.2s)]
*  To follow the law. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=336.91999999999996s)]
*  Follow the law. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=337.76s)]
*  Well, what do you think? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=339.44s)]
*  And she had no answer. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=340.26s)]
*  I think it's a bad precedent for a candidate [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=342.0s)]
*  to be president without answering any questions. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=344.2s)]
*  Yes, and we tried. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=348.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  So, numerous times. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=350.8s)]
*  But I think that- [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=352.12s)]
*  And they don't use it as an opportunity [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  to define themselves. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  Right, and I think she was using that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  to not alienate one side or the other, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=357.64000000000004s)]
*  but sometimes by doing that, you do, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=360.36s)]
*  because the people want answers. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=362.6s)]
*  I mean, the thing about Donald Trump [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=364.32s)]
*  is you know how he feels about pretty much everything. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  Right, and he's been a president before, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  and she's been a vice president before, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=369.64s)]
*  so you can compare the records. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=370.92s)]
*  Do you think, like in 2016, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=372.48s)]
*  there'll be that silent voter still [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=374.8s)]
*  that doesn't want to admit they're voting for Trump, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=376.72s)]
*  because maybe other people- [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=378.6s)]
*  Or Harris. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=380.64000000000004s)]
*  Or Harris. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=381.56s)]
*  So I do think it might go the other way, too. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  You do. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=383.88s)]
*  I mean, I actually think- [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=384.72s)]
*  But what about the Jewish vote? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=385.56s)]
*  I'm hearing from some friends here in New York [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=386.38s)]
*  that feel comfortable telling me, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=388.56s)]
*  since I work at Fox, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=389.82s)]
*  but they're saying, don't announce it on TV, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=391.24s)]
*  don't say my name, because they're voting for him, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=393.64s)]
*  but they don't want the community to know. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=396.24s)]
*  I told you guys this story back in 2016. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=397.76s)]
*  Outside, well, we had that tent, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=400.24s)]
*  we were outside where Hillary Clinton [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=402.12s)]
*  was getting the nomination. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=403.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  We had a really good spot in the parking lot. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=405.8s)]
*  But anyway, the Democratic nomination, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=407.32s)]
*  and walk out, and there's a guy with a [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=409.52s)]
*  I'm with her t-shirt, the union guy. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=412.2s)]
*  And he said, hey, Brett, I'm not with her, okay? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=414.6s)]
*  And I said, are you alone in that? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=416.92s)]
*  He walks me back to a lunchroom, 150 people. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=418.52s)]
*  He says, how many of you guys with her? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  No hands. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=423.02s)]
*  How many of you guys with Trump? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=423.86s)]
*  150 hands. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=425.08s)]
*  And so those were people that couldn't say it. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=426.6s)]
*  But they were all supporting Trump. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=430.0s)]
*  I think there is that element still. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=431.68s)]
*  But I'm not sure how much we know about [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=434.56s)]
*  the vote that's already banked, especially the gender gap. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=437.48s)]
*  If she loses, do you, when the finger pointing starts, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=440.8s)]
*  do you think they will regret not having come on Fox more? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=444.32s)]
*  I do, I actually, I think to get more eyeballs. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=449.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=452.28s)]
*  To, especially for disaffected Republicans or independents [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=453.12s)]
*  that they were trying to get with Liz Cheney [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=456.14s)]
*  and other efforts that they were making. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=458.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=461.48s)]
*  And you don't have to answer, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=462.52000000000004s)]
*  but you told me in the green room [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=464.44000000000005s)]
*  about a brush with a celebrity. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=466.34000000000003s)]
*  Do you want to reveal this because it is very interesting? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=468.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=471.76000000000005s)]
*  It only happens in New York. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=473.12s)]
*  I went to dinner with Harold Ford [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=474.44000000000005s)]
*  and Alex Kassianos last night. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=475.72s)]
*  And Alec Baldwin and his wife came up to the table [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=477.56s)]
*  and he said, I really liked playing you. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=481.0s)]
*  And so they were very gracious. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=483.54s)]
*  I didn't take a picture. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=486.76000000000005s)]
*  I thought it was a little over the top. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=488.18s)]
*  Harold said we're too big for that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=489.97999999999996s)]
*  And I said, I would have loved a picture. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=491.9s)]
*  But you're kicking yourself. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=493.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=494.41999999999996s)]
*  So how was he? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=495.26s)]
*  He was really gracious. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=496.08s)]
*  He was really great. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=497.02s)]
*  And we had a nice conversation. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=497.94s)]
*  Well, you know you made it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=498.97999999999996s)]
*  You're on SNL. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=500.26s)]
*  Was he watching you to see how you ate [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=501.74s)]
*  so he can portray you accurately this time? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=503.58s)]
*  Don't you guys have? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=506.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, we got him. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=507.21999999999997s)]
*  We've had many. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=508.85999999999996s)]
*  Not everyone's happy with theirs. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=509.7s)]
*  How's yours? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=511.09999999999997s)]
*  Not good. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=511.94s)]
*  Okay, I had that guy Bobby Moynihan, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=512.78s)]
*  easily 150 pounds overweight. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=515.18s)]
*  Well, you know. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=516.66s)]
*  Yeah, and a ton of shins. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=517.5s)]
*  But, whatever. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=519.78s)]
*  So you've got a big night. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=521.14s)]
*  Starts tomorrow night at 6 p.m. with Martha. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=522.5799999999999s)]
*  Yes, and it's gonna be a cast of thousands. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=524.9399999999999s)]
*  We will have everything covered. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=527.38s)]
*  And it's really cool. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=529.14s)]
*  The technology is gonna be great. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=530.4599999999999s)]
*  How do you prepare? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=532.3399999999999s)]
*  Do you think him is showing off? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=533.18s)]
*  What does he got? I do. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=534.18s)]
*  He's in another dimension. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=535.02s)]
*  No, it's like Tom Cruise. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aib0S2dW8RA&t=536.2199999999999s)]
