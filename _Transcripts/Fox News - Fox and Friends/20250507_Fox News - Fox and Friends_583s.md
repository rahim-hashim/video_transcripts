# Pam Bondi addresses 'demented' Tren de Aragua attack on NY cops: 'We will get these people'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0)
*  Attorney General Pan Bondi announcing the largest fentanyl bust in our nation's history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's take a look at what they're finding. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=5.0s)]
*  And there is really a story here at the West. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  As you know, people cross the border. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=8.88s)]
*  A lot of the cartel activity is there. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=10.6s)]
*  And now they're flooding those drugs to the West. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=13.4s)]
*  Look at Las Vegas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  You've got 2.7 kilograms of cocaine that is caught. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  You've got in Phoenix, 2.4 pounds of heroin, 5 kilograms of cocaine, 72 pounds of methamphetamine. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=20.88s)]
*  And then if you go all the way to Santa Fe, over 100,000 fentanyl pills, those are going [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=28.0s)]
*  to be followed by that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=33.6s)]
*  And if you look at Albuquerque, 396 kilos of fentanyl pills. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=35.36s)]
*  And always remember, where there is drugs, there is also guns as well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=40.32s)]
*  That's why you see those firearms that are there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  Let's bring in the Attorney General for the United States, Pan Bondi. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=47.24s)]
*  Madam Attorney General, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  I just got to ask you the question. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=53.72s)]
*  When you look at all of those fentanyl pills and the pounds and the kilos there, when [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=55.16s)]
*  you transfer that to the amount of deaths that could have happened in our country, how [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=60.48s)]
*  many people are we talking about? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  So Lawrence, they seized 3 million fentanyl pills in that raid. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=69.12s)]
*  And your graphic was just amazing, what you showed. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  3 million fentanyl pills. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=76.56s)]
*  Countless lives. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=79.32s)]
*  Each pill had the potential to kill a human being. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=80.36s)]
*  A human life. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=83.76s)]
*  An American life. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=84.76s)]
*  And that's why it's so deadly. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=86.72s)]
*  I've been carrying around a little vial with fake fentanyl in it, the amount it takes to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=87.96s)]
*  kill you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=91.84s)]
*  And it looks like a couple grains of salt, Lawrence. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=92.92s)]
*  That's all it takes to kill you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=96.36s)]
*  They're mixing this stuff up. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=98.12s)]
*  The precursors are made in China. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=99.48s)]
*  They're sending it to Mexico. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=101.52s)]
*  It's coming through our country in all different ways. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=102.92s)]
*  Now through India, now through the northern border. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=105.16s)]
*  They're attempting through the mail. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  All different ways. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=109.36s)]
*  This stuff had been in our country when our borders were wide open. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=110.4s)]
*  The main leader, you showed Salem, Oregon. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=114.28s)]
*  That's where he was located. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=116.72s)]
*  Sanchez Arayo. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=118.12s)]
*  He was the main leader of this gang. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=119.32s)]
*  He had, they're all Sinaloa cartel. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=121.72s)]
*  He had drugs in four other states. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=124.36s)]
*  You showed Colorado, Phoenix, Albuquerque, New Mexico. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=127.2s)]
*  That's where all these pills were located. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=131.04s)]
*  49 firearms and almost $5 million in cash was seized as a result of this raid. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=133.64s)]
*  That's the worst guy on the bottom right there in the graphic you just showed. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=142.88s)]
*  But all of those people worked for them. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  Six of them were illegal aliens. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=148.04s)]
*  All of them, Sinaloa cartel members, worst of the worst. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=150.28s)]
*  And Donald Trump took them off the streets and saved countless lives. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=154.0s)]
*  Madam Attorney General, this is the criminal enterprise of the border, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=158.56s)]
*  crossing the individuals off. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=162.96s)]
*  You got the human bodies, human trafficking, the drugs, and the guns as well. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=164.88s)]
*  It's one enterprise. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=169.84s)]
*  I want to talk about another investigation that your FBI has opened up into the 764, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=171.36s)]
*  these predators online. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=177.32s)]
*  What can you tell us about it? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=178.52s)]
*  Yeah, and thanks for bringing that up. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=180.28s)]
*  That's so important, Lawrence. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=181.88s)]
*  This is where, as I said, from instant message to instant nightmare. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=183.12s)]
*  Parents need to monitor what your kids are doing on the Internet. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=186.4s)]
*  Your kids have no right to privacy on the Internet. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  These monsters, we just arrested two. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  They were Americans, but they were hiding out in Greece. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  They're going after our kids on social media platforms, on gaming sites, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=197.4s)]
*  on any kind of, any way they're on the Internet. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=202.56s)]
*  They're targeting our children. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=206.44000000000003s)]
*  And what they're doing is they're infiltrating our society. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=208.44000000000003s)]
*  It's the darkest of the dark. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  They're getting children to self-mutilate. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  They're getting children to abuse animals and then in turn abuse others. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=216.28s)]
*  It's a horrific thing, and there are countless victims throughout this country. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=221.32s)]
*  You're going to hear at 1045 today, Director Patel and I are making an announcement [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=225.96s)]
*  about a separate child exploitation ring, completely separate from this. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=230.28s)]
*  But yeah, 764, our FBI, they've been on it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=234.52s)]
*  They've been arresting these guys. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=237.36s)]
*  They've been monitoring it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=238.72s)]
*  It's the darkest of the dark. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=239.72s)]
*  But children are getting recruited on the Internet from being on games, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=241.6s)]
*  social media, any kind of social media platform. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=245.8s)]
*  Parents, you've got to monitor what your kids are doing because they think they're [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=248.72s)]
*  talking to other children and they're not. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=252.28s)]
*  They're talking to monsters often. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=254.44s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=256.44s)]
*  You got to be all in your children's business to figure out what's going on, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=257.24s)]
*  who they're talking to. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=260.64s)]
*  I want to bring you, speaking of children, they told us that Trinidad and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=261.88s)]
*  I was just in a few apartment complexes, but it looks like they're all over the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=264.92s)]
*  country, including New York City. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=269.24s)]
*  A 12-year-old, an entire gang attacked our cops here in New York City, and then [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=272.20000000000005s)]
*  they just released them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=277.0s)]
*  What are you going to be doing to get these folks behind prison walls? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=278.12s)]
*  Because apparently they're just released in New York City. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=284.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=287.56s)]
*  And Lawrence, that's such a shame that they're doing that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=288.20000000000005s)]
*  It's endangering the lives of citizens and it's endangering the lives of law [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=291.04s)]
*  enforcement officers when they're doing this. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=295.48s)]
*  You can't comprehend that cities and states would be so demented to do [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=298.0s)]
*  something like this, to let these violent criminals, Trinidad is a terrorist [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=305.2s)]
*  organization, Centoil is a terrorist organization, MS-13 is a terrorist [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=309.32s)]

*  They're raping Americans. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  They're bringing guns into this country, no longer under Donald Trump. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=320.84s)]
*  And we will bring in any resources, Homeland Security. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=324.6s)]
*  Director Noem has been amazing, working with ICE, Tom Homan, and all of our DEI, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=327.32s)]
*  FBI agents, ATF agents, US Marshals, working hand in hand. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=332.12s)]
*  We will get these people off our streets. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  Lawrence, public safety is nonstop. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=339.48s)]
*  And even later today, in just a few minutes, I'm going back to the office [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=341.56s)]
*  and we're meeting with countless family members, Lawrence, of death row inmates. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=345.92s)]
*  We're meeting with the family members, the victims, who Joe Biden pardoned. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=353.76000000000005s)]
*  He pardoned 37 of the 40 death row inmates. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=357.92s)]
*  He commuted their sentences and took them off of death row. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=362.68s)]
*  These families didn't get any notice. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=365.8s)]
*  Some found out on Christmas Eve. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=367.76000000000005s)]
*  And I'm meeting today in private with all of these families, dozens of families who [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=370.36s)]
*  want to come and they want to vent, they want to tell their story about what [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=375.40000000000003s)]
*  happens, some of the most violent murders you can imagine. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=380.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump now is seeking the death penalty again on new homicides. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=383.52s)]
*  We've sought four since he's been in office and there will be more. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=387.84s)]
*  But you know, we have victims all over the country, Lawrence. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'm just glad that the Department of Justice, the FBI, Homeland [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=394.28s)]
*  Security is starting to focus on the victims again and not the criminals. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=397.76s)]
*  These people just run in our country. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=402.32s)]
*  I'm glad that the president is sending a strong message. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=404.84s)]
*  We appreciate your service, Madam Attorney General. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=408.56s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=411.0s)]
*  Thank you, Lawrence. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=412.44s)]
*  Thank you for caring. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=413.32s)]
*  You got it, of course. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=414.68s)]
*  And a manhunt is underway for a group of alleged teen-trained or Uwaga gang [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=415.76s)]
*  suspects, excuse me, accused of attacking NYPD officers in Times Square. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=420.4s)]
*  You can see it right there. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=424.4s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi speaking out on the threat to law enforcement just a [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=425.68s)]
*  few moments ago. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=428.96s)]
*  Watch her here. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=429.64s)]
*  It's endangering the lives of citizens and it's endangering the lives of law [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=430.64s)]
*  enforcement officers when they're doing this. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=434.92s)]
*  You can't comprehend that cities and states would be so demented to do [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=437.4s)]
*  something like this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=444.67999999999995s)]
*  Alexis McAdams is live from Times Square with the details and now that we have [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=446.59999999999997s)]
*  that video, people can see exactly what you've been talking about. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  Dana, that's right. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=455.88s)]
*  So you can explain it to people, but once you see the video, puts it into [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=456.56s)]
*  perspective. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=459.32s)]
*  So anyone that lives in New York City or that's coming to visit this summer, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=459.88s)]
*  watch out for this migrant gang. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=462.91999999999996s)]
*  They're part of Trend Day Rock, they're called Los Diablos Day 42, the little [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=465.0s)]
*  devils of 42nd Street. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=471.2s)]
*  They say they're linked to more than 300 crimes and counting, including this [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=472.59999999999997s)]
*  attack on the cops. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=475.96s)]
*  It starts when police say one of the migrants moves in and tries to steal a [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=476.96s)]
*  woman's purse. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=480.91999999999996s)]
*  He pushes her up against the wall. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=481.56s)]
*  You can see it in that video and tries to run away. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=483.0s)]
*  That's when these officers move in to stop them. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=485.35999999999996s)]
*  The crew attacks the two uniformed NYPD officers. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=487.67999999999995s)]
*  They're trying to call for backup, Dana, to get help. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=491.79999999999995s)]
*  Then these guys throw anything they could get their hands on, like glass [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=494.28000000000003s)]
*  bottles, a scooter, basketballs and rocks. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=497.68s)]
*  I want to focus in on one of the suspects. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=500.84000000000003s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  Because police say he is just 12 years old. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  You can see him in that white t-shirt. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=507.08s)]
*  He's so tiny, but he's not afraid of these officers. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=508.68s)]
*  He goes up, kind of jumps at them, fights with them, even throws a scooter. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=511.16s)]
*  Investigators tell me he was the leader of a theft ring in Central Park last [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=514.44s)]
*  summer, arrested many times, but released. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=517.96s)]
*  Border czar Tom Homan, who's on his way to New York today telling Fox, he's [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=520.76s)]
*  got a message for this gang. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=524.56s)]
*  These people are in the country illegally. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=526.88s)]
*  This is just another example of sanctuary cities not cooperating with ice. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=528.36s)]
*  And look what happened. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=532.96s)]
*  NYPD officers are attacked. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=533.96s)]
*  If you're brazen enough to attack an armed law enforcement officer, you're [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=535.52s)]
*  much more dangerous to an unarmed civilian. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=539.88s)]
*  Coming for them, coming to New York City. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=545.76s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=547.48s)]
*  So far five migrants arrested, but at least three are still on the run. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=548.36s)]
*  We're told these are their photos released by the NYPD trying to do [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=552.36s)]
*  everything they can to track them down. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  Back out here live in Times Square, DHS responding to our reporting, Dana, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=558.24s)]
*  calling these migrants cowards saying they're going to do everything they can [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=561.84s)]
*  to haunt these suspects down and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNv4nqBD_A0&t=565.32s)]
