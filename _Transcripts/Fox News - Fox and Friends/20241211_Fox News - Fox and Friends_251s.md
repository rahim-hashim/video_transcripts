# FBI official shocks lawmakers with answers on mystery drones
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k)
*  Also shocking that we don't know more about these drones. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=0.0s)]
*  This morning, New Jersey Governor Murphy [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=2.64s)]
*  holding an emergency meeting about the dozens of drones [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=4.4s)]
*  spotted all over the state, including these over my house. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=7.98s)]
*  That's right in front of my house. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=12.38s)]
*  Yesterday, lawmakers on Capitol Hill [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=14.38s)]
*  grilling the FBI for answers. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=16.76s)]
*  You're telling me we don't know [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=20.02s)]
*  what the hell these drones are in New Jersey are? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=21.48s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=24.82s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  That's madness that we don't know what these drones are. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=28.08s)]
*  I got an article right here, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=31.32s)]
*  mystery drone spotted over New York, New Jersey, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=32.48s)]
*  prompt calls for federal investigation. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=35.08s)]
*  What can you tell us about what you guys do know? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=37.72s)]
*  We do not know the particular specifics [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=40.64s)]
*  of what those drones are. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=43.72s)]
*  Is there still a possibility of there being a threat? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=46.08s)]
*  At the end of the day, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  that's what my constituents want to know. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=50.08s)]
*  I was just mentioning, it concerns me [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=53.28s)]
*  that we don't know the answer to your question yet. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=54.66s)]
*  Wow, that's shocking. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=59.08s)]
*  Our next guest who led that hearing warns [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=60.48s)]
*  we still have no way of stopping enemies like China [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  from using drones to spy on us. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=65.42s)]
*  GOP Congressman Carlos Jimenez joins us now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  Congressman, so I'm, first of all, this affects me directly. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=71.24s)]
*  I live there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  I've seen the drones in front of my house multiple times. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=76.84s)]
*  I've been able to record it at least once. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=79.4s)]
*  So they're saying they're not, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=81.56s)]
*  they either belong to the US government or they don't. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=84.0s)]
*  And if our military or FBI doesn't know that, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=86.8s)]
*  that's a problem, right? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it is a huge problem. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  And we as a nation are woefully unprepared [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=92.88s)]
*  for the challenges and the threats that these drones [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=96.92s)]
*  and other drones may pose to our facilities, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=99.78s)]
*  but also to American citizens. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=103.06s)]
*  Who specifically, which agency, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=104.88s)]
*  which agency head would you say is most responsible [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=106.96s)]
*  for knowing this? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=111.0s)]
*  Who should know this? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=112.8s)]
*  Who should be on top of this and giving us information? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  I should be Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=117.08s)]
*  This is a threat to the homeland. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=118.36s)]
*  And so both him and also the Department of Defense, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=120.6s)]
*  if these drones are buzzing around sensitive areas. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=124.2s)]
*  And so those two are the ones that are mainly responsible. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=127.16s)]
*  And that's part of the problem too, is that we have, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=131.04s)]
*  we have agencies all over the place [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=134.66s)]
*  that have some money allocated to drone defense. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=136.36s)]
*  It really should be focused [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=141.0s)]
*  so that we understand this threat. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=142.48s)]
*  And by the way, this threat is just gonna get worse [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=144.4s)]
*  and worse as these drones become more and more capable [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=146.28s)]
*  as AI is implemented and put into them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=149.52s)]
*  You can't on the one hand say there's no threat, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=152.8s)]
*  but we don't know what it is. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=155.68s)]
*  I mean, cause if you don't know what it is, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=157.0s)]
*  you can't really tell me there's no threat. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  So what has Alejandro Mayorkas said on this [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=160.22s)]
*  and why hasn't he been pressed more on it? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=162.56s)]
*  We should press more. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=165.0s)]
*  Look, yesterday was one of the first hearings we had [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=165.84s)]
*  on the drone threat. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=169.68s)]
*  I've been even way back when I was mayor [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  of Miami-Dade County, I was very worried about drones [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=173.72s)]
*  and the threat that they pose to our airports [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=176.92s)]
*  and our port facilities, even on a local level. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=179.24s)]
*  And so yeah, we as a nation need to start focusing in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=183.04s)]
*  on this threat. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=186.56s)]
*  And we as a nation need to, if we in Congress [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=187.56s)]
*  have to make some laws that allows, you know, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=190.36s)]
*  the agencies to take more appropriate action, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=192.96s)]
*  we need to do that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=194.92s)]
*  But also our capabilities, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=196.12s)]
*  we don't have the capabilities that we need [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=197.4s)]
*  to deal with them today, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=199.32s)]
*  much less the drones of the future, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=200.72s)]
*  which are gonna be more capable. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=202.29999999999998s)]
*  Are you worried citizens are gonna take this [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=203.85999999999999s)]
*  into their own hands? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, somewhat, but I also worried that we are not paying, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=208.54s)]
*  we, the federal government, is not paying enough attention [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  on how we can deal with the threat that drones pose, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=214.14s)]
*  not only just from surveillance, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=218.42s)]
*  but also as an offensive weapon. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  Look, look what's happening in Ukraine and Russia [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=223.66s)]
*  and what they're doing with drones. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=226.7s)]
*  It poses a very serious threat. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=229.01999999999998s)]
*  The cartels are using them as well on our southern border [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=230.82s)]
*  and we're having trouble wrapping our arms [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=233.5s)]
*  around that as well. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=235.0s)]
*  Congressman Jimenez, thanks for joining us. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=236.78s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=238.73999999999998s)]
*  It's my pleasure. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp0QynK5O3k&t=239.57999999999998s)]
