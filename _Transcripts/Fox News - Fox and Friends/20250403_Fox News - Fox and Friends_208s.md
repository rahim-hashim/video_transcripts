# Doocy: How long will the pain last?
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU)
*  Well, you saw it yesterday, 4 o'clock right here on the Fox News Channel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump unveiled global tariffs, which have, in the hours since, rattled markets [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=3.68s)]
*  all around the world, as other countries are considering retaliation, perhaps. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=9.96s)]
*  And Doug Lazator joins us now with the latest. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=15.16s)]
*  Hey, Doug. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=17.52s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=18.52s)]
*  This is largely a 10% across the board global tariff, but it could be much higher depending [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=19.52s)]
*  on each country's trade barriers. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=24.52s)]
*  And the president ran through some of those countries line by line. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=25.72s)]
*  Here he is yesterday in the Rose Garden. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=29.8s)]
*  April 2nd, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=32.64s)]
*  day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=40.16s)]
*  again. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  We cannot pay the deficits of Canada, Mexico, and so many other countries. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  We used to do it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  We can't do it anymore. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  We take care of countries all over the world. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  This will be indeed the golden age of America. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=57.4s)]
*  It's coming back. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=61.08s)]
*  We're going to come back very strongly. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=62.08s)]
*  So here is where we stand on other tariffs right now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=66.53999999999999s)]
*  Aluminum, steel, cars, car parts, 25%, with more tariffs possible on goods ranging from [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=69.4s)]
*  pharmaceuticals to lumber. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=75.28s)]
*  Reaction is pouring in from around the globe this morning, but the Treasury Secretary has [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=77.96s)]
*  a warning for other countries. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=82.06s)]
*  My advice to every country right now is do not retaliate. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=85.0s)]
*  Sit back. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=89.8s)]
*  Take it in. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=91.08s)]
*  Let's see how it goes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=92.08s)]
*  Because if you retaliate, there will be escalation. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=93.08s)]
*  If you don't retaliate, this is the high water mark. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=96.36s)]
*  The high water mark. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=100.52s)]
*  Now Israel is offering to end tariffs on U.S. imports, and Canada is already looking for [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=101.52s)]
*  a deal. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  We'd be willing to take those off tomorrow if he took all the tariffs off. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  We are not the problem, Andrew. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  Andrew, do you know what the problem is? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  China is the problem. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=116.48s)]
*  He knows, and Secretary Lutnick knows that we're willing to take these tariffs off in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=117.48s)]
*  the next minute if he said he's taking their tariffs off. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  All right, that's Canada. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Mexico's president promising an announcement today on how she intends to respond. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=129.28s)]
*  And everyone is watching the markets right now ahead of this morning's opening bell. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=133.84s)]
*  Back to you guys. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=138.16s)]
*  Thank you, Doug. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=139.16s)]
*  Yeah, and it would not be a good day to retire. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=140.16s)]
*  Doug, let me ask you this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=142.84s)]
*  When the numbers came out, because there was a briefing, an off-the-record briefing for [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=145.84s)]
*  a lot of reporters down in Washington yesterday, it sounded like that across-the-board thing [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=150.34s)]
*  was going to be it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=154.54s)]
*  It sounded like, okay, 10 percent, a baseline. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=155.54s)]
*  But then all that other stuff was glommed on top of it, depending on the country. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=158.12s)]
*  So this is much worse, much tougher on a lot of countries than Wall Street thought. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=163.24s)]
*  Yeah, and I think we saw Wall Street reflect those expectations yesterday. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=168.44s)]
*  And you know, they're trying to determine exactly what the trade barriers are from each [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=172.54s)]
*  country, factoring in not just tariffs but other things that they do to make it difficult [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=177.44s)]
*  for U.S. to export to those countries. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=182.24s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=184.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=185.84s)]
*  Thank you so much, Doug. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=186.84s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=187.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if they are heavily taxing us, why couldn't we heavily tax them? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=188.84s)]
*  The only way to remedy this is for them to stop taxing us, and then we will stop tariffing [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=192.16s)]
*  them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mEoWFaIrU&t=197.44s)]
