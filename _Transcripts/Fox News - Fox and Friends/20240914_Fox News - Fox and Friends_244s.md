# If Trump wins Nevada, he wins the White House: GOP Senate candidate
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts)
*  Former President Trump rallying voters yesterday in Battleground, Nevada, saying if he wins there, he would win the whole thing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=0.0s)]
*  He also gave a hero's welcome to retired Army captain Sam Brown, who's running for a crucial Senate seat in the Silver State. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=7.54s)]
*  Sam Brown has given up more than anybody who has ever run for the United States Senate. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=16.22s)]
*  Sam is a fearless patriot and purple heart recipient who served our country as a U.S. Army captain, totally respected in Afghanistan. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=22.94s)]
*  I said to him tonight, Sam, I'm going to be the border president. You should be the border senator. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=31.5s)]
*  Retired Army captain and Nevada Senate candidate Sam Brown joins us now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=39.900000000000006s)]
*  Sam, thanks for being here. Thank you for your service. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=43.94s)]
*  You were on stage. You were there yesterday with Donald Trump. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=46.74s)]
*  What's the feeling on the ground, both at the presidential level and in your Senate race? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=49.34s)]
*  You know, like, people are excited. There is so much on the line for this country right now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=53.9s)]
*  And President Trump has displayed the warrior spirit. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=61.18s)]
*  You know, yesterday was two different anniversaries. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=64.78s)]
*  One, it was just two months after President Trump had been shot in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=67.74s)]
*  But it was also the four-year anniversary for the first President Trump rally I've ever went to in Minden, Nevada, as a volunteer. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=72.78s)]
*  And as part of just the American dream that can only really happen here in America, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=80.7s)]
*  I went from being a volunteer four years ago to standing on the stage as a Republican nominee for U.S. Senate right here in Las Vegas, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=85.66s)]
*  and even had the opportunity to present President Trump with a book that I just published about my alive day, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=93.5s)]
*  How to Find Purpose and Hope After Losing Everything, and to be able to give that to President Trump when he's been such an inspiration, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=99.5s)]
*  such a champion for me and for this country, just meant so much. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=106.94s)]
*  And it's a great place for us to gather volunteers. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=110.7s)]
*  People are excited because they see hope in his leadership and also hope through this Senate race where we can take back the Senate majority. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=114.22s)]
*  Very cool. The book is alive day. Folks should check it out. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=122.86s)]
*  And this Senate race out in Nevada is a tight one. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=126.22s)]
*  And you're running against first-term Democrat Jackie Rosen. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=128.7s)]
*  As it goes in the Senate, if you don't beat him in their first time up, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=131.98s)]
*  it's hard to get rid of senators because they get really lodged in at state. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=134.86s)]
*  So this is this is the time to do it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=137.74s)]
*  Here's the most recent CNN poll on if the Nevada race for U.S. Senator were held today, who would you vote for? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=139.66000000000003s)]
*  It says 50-40. I would imagine you see it tighter on the ground because presidential is at 47-47. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=146.3s)]
*  Give us give us your prognosis of how the candidate you're running against here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=153.02s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, this is Harry Reid's protege, Jackie Rosen. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=158.06s)]
*  The country knows what leadership Harry Reid had in the Senate. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=162.46s)]
*  But Jackie Rosen hasn't served Nevadans. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=167.1s)]
*  Our internal polls are actually much tighter than what you're seeing in CNN. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=169.18s)]
*  But that's not surprising. CNN is known as fake news. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=172.22s)]
*  And look, when we go to rallies like this, one of the other benefits is we get so many people signing up and volunteering. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=176.3s)]
*  And those who weren't at the rally, they can still sign up and volunteer or support the campaign through CaptainSanBrown.com. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=182.38s)]
*  There is palpable excitement. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=188.62s)]
*  And again, people are desperate for a champion, someone who will be strong on the border like President Trump was talking about yesterday confronting the cartel. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=190.62s)]
*  But also people need economic relief. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=199.66s)]
*  And President Trump delivered that. A Republican Senate will deliver that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=202.62s)]
*  And as President Trump said, he wins Nevada, he wins the White House. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=206.3s)]
*  Similarly, when I win this Senate race, Republicans take back the Senate majority. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=209.9s)]
*  And again, people can join me at CaptainSanBrown.com. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=214.94000000000003s)]
*  There you go. It's a big race. It's a big state. All eyes on it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=218.14000000000001s)]
*  And your background and your service, it's amazing to see you have this platform, you know, go from four years ago to today. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=221.10000000000002s)]
*  We wish you the best and we thank you for coming on our program, Captain San Brown. Thank you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=228.3s)]
*  Thank you, Pete. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=232.06s)]
*  You got it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4cxHNCUxts&t=232.78000000000003s)]
