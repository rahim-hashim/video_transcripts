# 'STAGGERING': 'Gotaway' numbers show massive drop under Trump admin
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk)
*  Well, one thing that we're learning about is, and we've been to the border, we were [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=0.0s)]
*  at the border with the Secretary of Defense yesterday, last week, as well as Homeland [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=3.9s)]
*  Security Secretary Kristi Noem. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=7.72s)]
*  And the border is closed. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=9.76s)]
*  It is locked down, and we're learning that 93, it's down the crossings. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=11.48s)]
*  I think the gotaway numbers are down by 93 percent. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=15.96s)]
*  And that just shows you the efforts that the administration is making is working. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=20.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=25.28s)]
*  The numbers during the, this is Trump versus Biden, as you can see the top two numbers [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=26.28s)]
*  during the Biden administration in fiscal year 2023, 1800 a day. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=31.48s)]
*  Right now it is at 132, that is down 93 percent. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=39.32s)]
*  Tom Homan yesterday said that interior enforcement, in other words, the number of people who are [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=43.6s)]
*  being apprehended here within the interior of the United States is three times higher [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=51.02s)]
*  than it was a year ago. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=56.92s)]
*  But at the same time, there are a couple of stories out there this morning that apparently [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=58.86s)]
*  the White House is not crazy about the numbers. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  They would like to see the numbers bigger. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  Apparently the White House has stopped giving out the daily numbers. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=68.9s)]
*  They're frustrated that the numbers of the people being deported are not big enough, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=72.14s)]
*  get where the president wanted it to be, where it would be millions deported. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=78.1s)]
*  And yesterday two top ICE officials were removed from their jobs. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=82.58s)]
*  One went back to the field office in D.C., the other to Minneapolis or St. Paul. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=86.58s)]
*  He wants $175 billion, says Tom Homan. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=91.02s)]
*  He needed to complete the U.S.-Mexican border wall. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=94.0s)]
*  And he says, I got to hire more law enforcement agencies. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=96.17999999999999s)]
*  And then Senator Lindsey Graham says, yeah, if a Republican Congress can't deliver this [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=99.69999999999999s)]
*  on the border, why are we even here? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=103.38s)]
*  You're 100 percent right. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=105.82s)]
*  And you have people in the House that don't want to vote for anything that has to do with [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=106.98s)]
*  spending, which I think they've got to get their act together. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=110.42s)]
*  They really could use those two extra seats, one from Stefanik, one from Matt Gaetz. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=112.94s)]
*  So they had repatriation fights going into Venezuela, first one in a couple of years. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=117.14s)]
*  They thought that was going to be impossible too. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=121.7s)]
*  So I personally am not worried about the pace. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=123.96s)]
*  I just know how dangerous it is to go into these buildings with these ICE guys, because [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=126.66s)]
*  the ICE guys go up to criminals usually armed with nothing to lose. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=131.18s)]
*  So I like the pace. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=134.98s)]
*  Think about all the people, Mr. President, that are not coming because you're cracking [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=136.62s)]
*  down. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=140.46s)]
*  That has a lot to do with these numbers. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=141.46s)]
*  So I just mess as a senior ICE official because I'm trying to figure out, are they going to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=142.62s)]
*  figure out who this leaker is? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=147.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=148.82s)]
*  It's damaging. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=149.82s)]
*  Out in California? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=150.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=151.82s)]
*  Who's messing up what's going on? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=152.82s)]
*  The source just told me, he says, ICE needs a culture of accountability that has been [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=154.74s)]
*  starved for the past four years. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=159.70000000000002s)]
*  We have a president, DHS secretary and American people who rightfully demand results, and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=161.94s)]
*  ICE leadership will deliver those results. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=167.1s)]
*  Apparently, they're cleaning house inside of the agency right now. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=169.26s)]
*  They're figuring out who exactly is a holdover, that's a career person that is leaking the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=173.1s)]
*  information and they're trying to give them the boot. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=177.82s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=180.74s)]
*  That's exactly what's illustrated by the accountability, as you just said, how the ICE officials were [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=181.74s)]
*  removed. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=185.38s)]
*  The whole point is that President Trump is holding a mirror not just to the entire, it [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=186.38s)]
*  includes the administrations and the people that he has installed too. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=189.94s)]
*  That 93%, that is staggering because of the speed. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=194.14s)]
*  Within one week, it was down 93%. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  And I hear you, we're just grateful to see movement from the interior, but it just goes [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=199.78s)]
*  to show the high standards the president expects and says, no, no, it's not good enough. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=203.5s)]
*  It's not good enough that the president of Venezuela, or Columbia says, oh, well, I'll [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=207.5s)]
*  use my own plane, 200 each. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=210.54s)]
*  No, I want to make it 200 million. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=212.3s)]
*  Just as yesterday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams touted his 187 million illegal immigrants [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=214.62s)]
*  that they processed through the systems, POTUS says, well then where are they now? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=221.34s)]
*  And yesterday we were talking a little bit about how a couple, four FEMA employees, a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=225.46s)]
*  couple of top guys were fired because they gave millions of dollars, tens of millions [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=231.46s)]
*  of dollars to house migrants here in New York. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=235.94s)]
*  FEMA, that's a problem. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  So ultimately what the administration is trying to do and the Doge people are trying to help [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=241.02s)]
*  with this is make sure that everybody in an agency is on the same page because you're [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=244.46s)]
*  working for the boss. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=251.06s)]
*  And if everybody's freelancing, it's not going to work. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=252.34s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  Let's talk about the northern border because that is a big focus. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=256.42s)]
*  President said you got one month to clean it up. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=258.62s)]
*  Where Trudeau, you got 25% tariffs coming your direction. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=260.46000000000004s)]
*  He goes, I want the fentanyl cleaned up and I want the level of traffic coming through [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  stopped. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=270.58s)]
*  I need some emphasis on there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=271.58s)]
*  So they're going to put some assets. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=272.66s)]
*  The other thing they're doing is they're going to get a fentanyl czar and they have it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=274.98s)]
*  And he is on board with a very impressive resume. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=278.86s)]
*  And we talked to the sheriff of Plattsburgh area in upstate New York, Clinton County, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=281.90000000000003s)]
*  and he is encouraged about what he's seeing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=286.86s)]
*  He also said there's 23 years on the job. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=289.14000000000004s)]
*  He's never seen it so bad. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=291.70000000000005s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  I looked quickly at his resume and it is impressive. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=294.54s)]
*  I think he's got some, some really good experience and he certainly seems motivated. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=297.32000000000005s)]
*  So I'm really hoping that he does reach out. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=302.18s)]
*  We can have some good law enforcement team communications and strategize. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=304.54s)]
*  But the key is the key to success is going to be whether or not there's a full and truthful [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=308.62s)]
*  sharing of Intel. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=313.3s)]
*  What are they getting? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=314.98s)]
*  What are they seeing? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=315.98s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=316.98s)]
*  That's going to be the key. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=317.98s)]
*  It's not going to be the after effect. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=318.98s)]
*  It's not an us against they. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=321.1s)]
*  We're on the same team and we need to be able to work together on this to be able to combat [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  the problem and we can be successful with his resume and what he's done in the past. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=326.38s)]
*  We certainly should be able to accomplish that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=331.06s)]
*  Let's say 43. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=333.02s)]
*  They say 43 billion pounds, a million pounds have come through and they said that could [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=334.02s)]
*  have killed nine million people. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=338.54s)]
*  We share a border. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=341.18s)]
*  We should share Intel. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=342.22s)]
*  And he'll, you know, as he said, the majority of those coming through at this moment of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=343.22s)]
*  illegal immigrants are Indians. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=346.38s)]
*  So for those on the left that kept shouting about protests of our poorest southern border [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=347.78s)]
*  had tenants of racism that that was the roots. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=352.22s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=355.1s)]
*  because both borders have all colors of people all the time from 85 plus different countries [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=357.1s)]
*  and counting. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=363.1s)]
*  Look at that as they scatter. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=364.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me1_MdS2Vkk&t=365.1s)]
