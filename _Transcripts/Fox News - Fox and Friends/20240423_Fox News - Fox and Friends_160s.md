**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys)
*  The New Haven Police Department says 47 anti-Israel protesters were arrested, the university adding, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=0.0s)]
*  students who were arrested also will be referred for Yale disciplinary action, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=6.72s)]
*  which includes a range of sanctions such as reprimand, probation or suspension. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=11.28s)]
*  And the president of Columbia University now facing bipartisan calls to resign [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=16.64s)]
*  over her handling of the anti-Semitic protests on her campus. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=21.52s)]
*  Democrat Senator John Fetterman saying the following, these protests quote unquote are [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=25.279999999999998s)]
*  anti-Semitic, unconscionable and dangerous. Add some tiki torches and it's Charlottesville [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=30.08s)]
*  for these Jewish students. To Columbia President Manu Shafik, do your job or resign so Columbia [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=35.76s)]
*  can find someone who will. Meantime, New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  praising the anti-Israel protesters, calling them peaceful during an Earth Day event with [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  President Biden. Listen. It is especially important that we remember the power of young [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=53.52s)]
*  people shaping this country today of all days as we one once again witness the leadership of those [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  peaceful student led protests on campus is like Columbia, Yale, Berkeley and many others. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=66.16s)]
*  These protests are not just confined to the schools that AOC mentioned there, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  they are spreading across the country at Rice University in Texas. There's going to be a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=78.64s)]
*  liberated zone set up. You also have a few schools in Massachusetts, Tufts, MIT and Emerson also [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=83.6s)]
*  having protest activity today. And as the sun's come up here and as more people have been around [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=90.08s)]
*  the campus, I've gotten an opportunity to talk to people just walking casually throughout the campus. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=94.48s)]
*  And if there's one word that stands out more than any other, it's not that these protests were so [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=99.44s)]
*  violent here on the Yale University campus, but it is that they were organized. Something we've [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=105.28s)]
*  suspected, something we've reported on. There's definitely an element of organization here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=110.88s)]
*  It does seem like yesterday kind of followed a plan for the protesters. There was a bus there, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=115.76s)]
*  there were individuals there with cameras. They knew what they were doing. And that's ultimately [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=121.04s)]
*  what I expect to see at other universities throughout the country. Back over to you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=125.28s)]
*  All right, Todd, a lot of them get federal funding and you want to start controlling the campuses. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=128.96s)]
*  You know what's interesting too, how is this going to affect the election? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=133.12s)]
*  Right, but Virginia Foxx came out and said they better get their act together at Columbia or [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=136.0s)]
*  find your federal funding is going to be jeopardized. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=141.12s)]
*  Well, Brian and I just went off the wall to discuss how they are organized, where the funding comes [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  from both on campus and off campus. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhCMblW4ys&t=148.0s)]
