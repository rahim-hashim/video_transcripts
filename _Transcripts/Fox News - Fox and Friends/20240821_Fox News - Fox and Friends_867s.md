# JD Vance: This is what the Democratic Party is really about
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4)
*  and senator j. D. Vance. Good morning to you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning, guys. How are you? Good morning. We're doing well. Stayed up late last [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=5.3s)]
*  night. These speeches are the headliners are coming on way too late for all of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=8.02s)]
*  us who work these morning shows. But that's okay. We'll continue to cover it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  Um, there were a lot of vibes, lots of energy. How is this working? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=15.82s)]
*  You know, I don't think it's working very well. Ainsley, obviously I'm not the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=23.0s)]
*  target audience here. But when you have Barack Obama, the former Democratic [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=25.72s)]
*  president of the United States sitting there and making his big speech and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=29.58s)]
*  Kamala Harris is 90 miles away, I think it suggests that their party is not [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=34.18s)]
*  especially unified. Of course, we know that Barack Obama is one of the people [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=37.58s)]
*  who really forced Joe Biden out of the race to begin with. So I think the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=41.42s)]
*  conflict is actually buried beneath the surface but is there for all to see. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=45.06s)]
*  And I think just for the American people, I mean, you ask yourself, what is [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=49.459999999999994s)]
*  the Democratic Party about in this country in 2024? It's clearly about [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=52.66s)]
*  their hatred of Donald Trump more than their love for America. They talked [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=57.18s)]
*  about Trump more than they talked about inflation, more than they talked about [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=60.86s)]
*  their foreign policy achievements, more than they talked about the economy. I [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=64.26s)]
*  think that suggests the thing that really unites the Democratic Party is [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=67.58s)]
*  not any shared vision for how they want to advance this country. It's their [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=71.14s)]
*  hatred of one person, a person who, by the way, took a bullet for this country [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  just a few short weeks ago. Yeah, JD, um, as Senator Vance, a couple of things [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=79.14s)]
*  that stand out. The two strong suits for you guys are immigration and the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=84.42s)]
*  economy. And they're trying to say that when it comes to immigration, the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=88.82s)]
*  border is now better now than it was when when you in the last year, the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=92.82s)]
*  Trump administration and that Donald Trump told everyone not to vote for [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=96.82s)]
*  that bipartisan plan that was engineered by Senator Langford and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=101.78s)]
*  Senator Murphy. Would you have voted for it? What is the problem with it? Do you [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=105.58s)]
*  think it was a mistake not to vote for it? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, Brian, just on the idea that the border is somehow better, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=112.46000000000001s)]
*  this comes from the manipulation of statistics. The reason why border [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=116.46000000000001s)]
*  crossings are a little bit lower now than they were last year is because [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=120.9s)]
*  they're flying people into the ports of entry. If you look at the total border [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=124.62s)]
*  crossings, the asylum claims and add them altogether, we're in a position at [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=128.26s)]
*  the southern border that is worse today than it has ever been in the history of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=132.26s)]
*  this country. So they're lying with statistics. But on your question about [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=135.58s)]
*  this border deal, Brian, it was a disaster. I would not have voted for it [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=140.26s)]
*  if Donald Trump had told me you have to vote for this thing. And that's how the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=144.1s)]
*  majority of my Republican colleagues felt. What it did was really codify the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  worst parts of the Biden Harris approach to immigration. It codified [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=152.06s)]
*  catch and release. It would have done nothing on remain in Mexico. It would [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=156.42s)]
*  have done nothing on the millions of people that Kamala Harris has granted [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=159.62s)]
*  parole, which is really blown up and opened up the American southern border. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=163.66s)]
*  So it was a bad bill, and it would have made our border policy even worse. And [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=168.5s)]
*  the fact that the Democrats are celebrating this, Brian, instead of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=173.5s)]
*  running from it, I think just suggests how warped their view is on immigration [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=177.42s)]
*  policy. This is not hard. Donald Trump secured the border. Kamala Harris [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=181.62s)]
*  opened it up. If we go back to his leadership, we'll have a secure [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=186.54s)]
*  southern border, and the American people are smart enough to see that. So, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=189.54s)]
*  Senator, I had the opportunity to go be here in Chicago, talk with some voters. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=192.74s)]
*  I made it very clear that I feel like black males are primed for the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=196.74s)]
*  Republicans to take. But this is what they told me about the issues facing [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=200.06s)]
*  the country. Watch [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=204.3s)]
*  you're hearing from the Democrats are already things that they failed that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=206.74s)]
*  over 30 years. Blacks are struggling more than any other Democrat. We got [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  the highest prison rate, highest high school dropout rate, highest murder [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=215.5s)]
*  rate. What's in it for us? Basically, most of us, I believe we we voted [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=219.82000000000002s)]
*  Democrat because that's what we was brought up to do. You know, you go to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=224.38s)]
*  the poll, they say vote Democrat, vote Democrat. But I don't really see no [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=228.26s)]
*  change that they said they did doing. I think it's just to me a whole bunch of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=231.5s)]
*  crap, to be honest. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=236.54s)]
*  So when we see a senator dance in a barbershop, I promise you they can give [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=239.26s)]
*  you a fade. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=242.82s)]
*  Well, I actually need a haircut from time to time. So maybe I will show up [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=247.3s)]
*  in the in the barbershop, Lawrence. But look, I mean, my message to black [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=251.5s)]
*  voters in the barbershop or outside of it, Lawrence, is pretty simple here that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=255.94s)]
*  the argument they're making is actually very much common sense here. What [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=260.82s)]
*  they're saying is that Democratic policies have failed the black community [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=265.5s)]
*  for a generation. I mean, you know my story, Lawrence. I grew up with a [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=268.94s)]
*  grandmother who sometimes struggled to find enough to eat. I know that a lot of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=272.38s)]
*  families black and white are in that exact same situation. But grocery prices [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=276.86s)]
*  are up 20% thanks to the policies of Kamala Harris. And she stands there and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=281.14s)]
*  says on day one, she's going to make groceries more affordable. Well, day one [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=285.06s)]
*  Kamala was 1300 days ago and you haven't done anything. And I think it's so [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=288.38s)]
*  inspiring that you have those those those men in that barbershop who are [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=292.94s)]
*  standing up and saying, Look, whatever the media propaganda has been fed to us, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=296.34s)]
*  we have not had better lives under the policies of Democrat leadership. So [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=300.78s)]
*  we're willing to give the Republicans a chance. I think we just have to go into [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=305.58s)]
*  these communities, make the argument and say we're gonna fight for you. We're [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=308.78s)]
*  gonna fight for your wages. We're gonna fight for your jobs and we're gonna [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=312.34s)]
*  fight for affordable housing and for affordable groceries for you and your [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=315.17999999999995s)]
*  Children. That's what we're gonna do over the next, I guess, 76 days. Lawrence [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=318.61999999999995s)]
*  Senator tonight at the DNC, Nancy Pelosi is gonna speak. Bill Clinton is gonna [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=322.21999999999997s)]
*  speak. Pete Buttigieg is gonna speak and Tim Walz, the governor of the great [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=327.09999999999997s)]
*  state of Minnesota, is going to speak. He's their vice presidential nominee. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=331.58s)]
*  You and he will square off on a stage somewhere and, you know, at the one vice [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=336.22s)]
*  presidential debate, which has been agreed to. Um, have you figured out your [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=342.06s)]
*  main plan of attack against Coach Walls? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=347.86s)]
*  Well, I have to point that out since he asked that, of course, Kamala Harris [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=352.98s)]
*  announced this morning that she's running from the Fox News debate. And [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=356.66s)]
*  what a disgrace it is for Kamala Harris and Tim Walls to talk tough, but then [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=359.98s)]
*  to run from the American people's questions to run from these debates. I [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=364.22s)]
*  think if you want to be the vice president or the president, you ought [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  to do as many debates as you can, because that's an opportunity to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=370.14000000000004s)]
*  actually talk to the American people and make your pitch to them. My approach [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=373.58000000000004s)]
*  for the one debate that it looks like I'm gonna have with Tim Walls is just [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=377.62s)]
*  to keep it focused on policy. You know, this is a guy who supported the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=380.46000000000004s)]
*  rioters in Minneapolis as they burned down that city to the ground. This is a [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  guy who supported policies that would defund the police that have raised the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=388.38000000000005s)]
*  price of groceries and of energy for American families. And I just want [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=391.82s)]
*  anybody who watches that debate to come away with it with a recognition that I [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=396.21999999999997s)]
*  know what it's like to deal with some of the problems and some of the bad [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=400.26s)]
*  policies of Kamala Harris. And we're gonna make things better if the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=403.74s)]
*  American people trust us with the opportunity to do so. And so that that's [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=406.84s)]
*  how I'm gonna keep it focused. And that's what I'm gonna focus my preparation [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=410.5s)]
*  on. We've been watching some old clips right here on the Fox News channel of [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=413.3s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard debating Kamala Harris when when they were both running for [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=417.5s)]
*  president. I know you're preparing for the debate. It's gonna be October 1st [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=422.04s)]
*  here in New York City on CBS. So how are you preparing for this? What are you [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=425.3s)]
*  doing? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=429.88s)]
*  You know, I'm just reading a lot about all the policies that have actually [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=432.9s)]
*  made people better under the presidency of Donald Trump and all the policies [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=437.54s)]
*  that have made people worse under the presidency or the vice presidency. I [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=441.6s)]
*  should say of Kamala Harris. I mean, I think that most Americans understand [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=445.58000000000004s)]
*  that the leader of this country is either gonna unleash American prosperity [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=450.38s)]
*  and restore peace to the world, or they're gonna bury us further in debt, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=454.66s)]
*  further in inflation and further in chaos across the world. So I think Ainsley [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=458.66s)]
*  the best way for me to make my case to the American people is just to talk [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=463.06s)]
*  about the specifics and the details. I think political consultants assume that [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=466.70000000000005s)]
*  Americans are dumb. I assume that Americans are smart and that if you [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=470.94s)]
*  level with them about the ways in which Kamala Harris failed and Donald Trump [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=474.74s)]
*  succeeded, that's the best way to earn their trust and to get Donald Trump [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=478.42s)]
*  back in the White House. And I'll tell you, I know a lot of people watching us [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=481.94s)]
*  now are going to work so they don't see it. But I've watched you do three or [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=484.82s)]
*  four press conferences during the day, small and big events. There's very few [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=488.02s)]
*  issues you care you're not comfortable with, and you like the give and take [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=491.86s)]
*  with people. You seem to excel at it. There's something else that's gonna [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=495.48s)]
*  come up today, I'm sure, and that is RFK and a running mate are to considering [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=498.44s)]
*  abandoning their campaign and possibly joining forces with you guys. What would [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=504.74s)]
*  that mean? You looked at the stats, you've talked to the experts, you got [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=510.38s)]
*  your strategy there. Could RFK help? I know Donald Trump has said I'd put him [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=514.22s)]
*  in the cabinet. Well I think it would be good for the campaign, Brian, and I've [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=518.34s)]
*  never talked to RFK about this, but my pitch to him and to a lot of his voters [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=524.1800000000001s)]
*  would be the Democratic Party of my grandparents that supported his uncle [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=527.98s)]
*  John F. Kennedy for president has been completely abandoned by the modern [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=532.3s)]
*  leadership of the Democratic Party. I mean that was a party that believed in [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=535.9799999999999s)]
*  strong borders, that was a party that believed in building and making things [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=539.0999999999999s)]
*  in America, that believed in a strong national security, and really believed [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=542.9399999999999s)]
*  that we were all part of the same American family. This modern Democratic [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=546.8599999999999s)]
*  Party is focused on division, it's focused on putting people into racial and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=551.14s)]
*  gender buckets and then using those divisions for political power, and it [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=555.74s)]
*  doesn't believe in anything common sense like American manufacturing or a strong [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=559.5s)]
*  American border. So I think the current Democratic leadership has gone so far in [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=563.94s)]
*  the leftward direction that RFK and that kind of Democrat is no longer welcome in [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=569.82s)]
*  the modern Democratic Party. I hope he, like Tulsa Gabbard, endorses the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=574.98s)]
*  president, gets on the team because this is about saving the country. Democrat or [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=579.14s)]
*  Republican, it's about saving the country through common sense and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=583.42s)]
*  unfortunately there's only one political party that really represents [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=586.54s)]
*  common sense anymore, it's Donald J. Trump's Republican Party. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=589.98s)]
*  But Senator, how do you guys make that pitch of, okay you guys are great on policy. It seems like when you look at the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=592.98s)]
*  polling data, the American people actually agree with you on policy, but [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=599.0999999999999s)]
*  there's that other element. People vote based on how they feel, and I'm not just [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=603.78s)]
*  talking about when they go to the grocery store or anything like that, but [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=607.66s)]
*  they need to connect with you. So how do you layer good policy with good feeling [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=610.78s)]
*  as well, because that seems to be an Achille heel of the Republican Party. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=616.62s)]
*  Even the guys I talked to yesterday, they said, listen, they come off a little [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=622.14s)]
*  corny sometimes, a little cheesy sometimes. So how do you make being a [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=625.18s)]
*  Republican, a conservative, cool again? Well, the way that I do it, Lawrence, and [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=629.66s)]
*  this is just my approach, is that I talk about my family and I talk about my [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=637.02s)]
*  personal history and I try to make people understand that we care about how [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=640.5s)]
*  this country is governed because we know that real people suffer. I mean, I [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=644.18s)]
*  think if you're, you know, a strong man at a barbershop, one of the things you [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=647.78s)]
*  believe in is that you ought to take care of people, you ought to protect people, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=652.0999999999999s)]
*  and you ought to get American leaders in there that are going to make your [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=655.2199999999999s)]
*  community stronger and more prosperous. And so how can we better make that case [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=658.2199999999999s)]
*  than talk about the ways in which our leadership can affect the lives of real [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=662.4599999999999s)]
*  people? I mean, look, I, you know, I grew up in a family where there wasn't a whole [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=666.62s)]
*  lot of opportunity. I grew up in a family, Lawrence, you know, where we couldn't [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=670.3399999999999s)]
*  afford private security. So why did we need strong police? Because we believe [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=674.02s)]
*  that public safety was the right of every American citizen, whether you're [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=678.74s)]
*  rich or poor. A lot of American kids don't have that these days because the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=682.02s)]
*  Democrats have decided to wage war on American police. And I think if you tick [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=685.9s)]
*  through the issues here, we just believe in common sense and we think that if [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=689.6999999999999s)]
*  you're governed by common sense, every kid in this country, black or white, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=694.34s)]
*  rich or poor, is going to have an opportunity at the American dream. We [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=698.06s)]
*  just got to get back to that common sense. We're going to make that argument as [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=701.06s)]
*  much as we can and see how it lands, man. That's all we can do. A lot of people [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=703.7s)]
*  don't know about those issues, though. We've done some interviews with Matt. We [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=706.34s)]
*  call it M. O. S. Is man on the street. And why are you voting? We were at the [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=709.7800000000001s)]
*  fair in Iowa. Why are you voting for Kamala? Well, I don't know. I might [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=713.26s)]
*  change my mind. I don't really know what she stands for. But when you hit when [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=717.1s)]
*  you hit the when you tell them the truth, when you tell the voter the truth [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=720.98s)]
*  about how high inflation is compared Donald Trump to Kamala Harris and Joe [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=723.94s)]
*  Biden, when you look at grocery prices, compare them gas prices, compare them. I [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=728.58s)]
*  mean, the numbers speak for themselves. So you really have toe when you take the [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=733.38s)]
*  state to the stage or when you do these interviews, issues, issues, issues. So [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=737.1800000000001s)]
*  what are you planning on doing tonight in North Carolina or today in North [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=740.98s)]
*  Carolina at the rally? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=744.5s)]
*  Well, you know, Ainsley, to that point, I mean, my my my sympathy is with every [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  American, of course, and a lot of people, they're not really tuned in yet. You [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=751.3000000000001s)]
*  know, they won't cast their ballots until the day before the election, maybe [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=754.7800000000001s)]
*  on Election Day itself. And so I think it's totally reasonable for them. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=758.0600000000001s)]
*  They've got jobs and kids to take care of. They've got a life to lead. They're [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=761.62s)]
*  not going to focus on politics until the very end. Our job, right, our [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=765.38s)]
*  responsibility, meaning Donald Trump and mine, is to actually get out there and [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=769.2199999999999s)]
*  tell them and make the case that our policies are going to make their lives [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=773.3399999999999s)]
*  better. Right. So I think the fact that they're a little unsure right now is [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=777.3399999999999s)]
*  just representative of the fact that we're still early in the election cycle. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=781.5s)]
*  They haven't yet made up their mind. And on that point in North Carolina today, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=785.02s)]
*  we're going to talk about national security. I mean, whose Children suffer [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=788.38s)]
*  the most when we have a weak national security? You know, those 13 Marines [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=792.14s)]
*  that died in Afghanistan, those kids very often come from middle and working [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=796.56s)]
*  class backgrounds. They would be here with us today if we just had stronger [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=801.22s)]
*  American leadership. And I think that people understand that it's very often [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=805.68s)]
*  the middle class and the working class who bear the burden when our leadership [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=810.38s)]
*  doesn't do its job. We're going to talk about that in the national security [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=814.46s)]
*  context, but we're going to talk about that in all context for the next 75 days [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=817.4599999999999s)]
*  and make our case to the American people every single day. And again, I think [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=822.0999999999999s)]
*  when we make our case, they hear what we're about. We're gonna win this race [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=825.9399999999999s)]
*  and we're gonna win it in a big way. And by the way, if you have some time, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=829.3399999999999s)]
*  try to find tens of thousands of kids who this administration has lost track [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=831.9399999999999s)]
*  of that came in here as unaccompanied minors. They just have lost track. And [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=836.0999999999999s)]
*  Barack Obama brought about separating kids and families. About 80,000 kids [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=840.42s)]
*  are just missing. So that's gonna be if you guys are wind. I would love that [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=845.3s)]
*  be your focus. All right, Senator. Thank you very much. Thanks for spending 15 [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5TNg-mSIn4&t=850.14s)]
