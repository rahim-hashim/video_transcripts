# 'WHOLE LOT OF INCOMPETENCE': 'Top' officials slammed over mystery drone fiasco
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg)
*  and we'll be right back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=0.0s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=1.0s)]
*  Happy Thanksgiving. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=2.0s)]
*  And there's a lot to be thankful for on this Thanksgiving. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=3.0s)]
*  And that includes our men and women in uniform serving in our military. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=8.0s)]
*  Joining us with his Thanksgiving message is Medal of Honor recipient Staff Sergeant David [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=12.14s)]
*  Belvia. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=17.96s)]
*  David, thanks for joining us this morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=18.96s)]
*  Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family, brother. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=19.96s)]
*  What you got for us this Thanksgiving? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=22.36s)]
*  Well, it just, there's a whole new swagger back in our military this year. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=25.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=30.36s)]
*  And it's fantastic. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=31.36s)]
*  Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=32.36s)]
*  But I'm just saying, I feel it all over from every branch of service that our swagger's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=35.36s)]
*  back and good things are going to happen for the country. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=40.36s)]
*  And I'm grateful for the finest military in the world. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=44.36s)]
*  And having that self-esteem, that morale back with this election, it means a lot. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=47.36s)]
*  It really does. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=52.36s)]
*  You know, I think if I were going to take a word and describe you with it, you'd probably [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=53.36s)]
*  be happier about the word warrior than anything. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=56.36s)]
*  You know, from your Medal of Honor citation to addresses you've given that I've seen [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=59.36s)]
*  go viral, I kind of understand where your heart is on that and how important it is to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=63.36s)]
*  have warriors in our wars. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=67.36s)]
*  But if we take a step back and look at where things have gone in the last couple of years, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=70.36s)]
*  we had spy balloons flying over military bases in this country. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=73.36s)]
*  And now we've got drones spying on military bases, U.S. bases in the U.K. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=77.36s)]
*  I don't know if you know a lot about drones. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=83.36s)]
*  I'm not really going to ask you about that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=85.36s)]
*  But when we look at these, they're strategic bases. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=86.36s)]
*  One of them, I believe it's the Lakenheath, is considered the foundation of the U.S. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=88.36s)]
*  Air Force's combat capability in Europe. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=92.36s)]
*  What does that say about our posture if our enemies think they can spy on us this blatantly? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=95.36s)]
*  Well, first of all, I love that the first thing the Pentagon did was rule out hobbyists, right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=103.36s)]
*  I mean, swarms of drones happened the day after the Sparrow missiles, which are British, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=109.36s)]
*  went into Russia, and then the Atacams went into Russia from Ukraine. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=114.36s)]
*  That's like the first thing we do, we rule out the spy balloon wasn't the Wizard of Oz [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=119.36s)]
*  that flew over the United States for seven days from California. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=124.36s)]
*  I mean, it's one thing to have morale and swagger. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=128.36s)]
*  You talk about that warrior ethos. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=133.36s)]
*  But there's a whole lot of incompetence. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=134.36s)]
*  And it comes from the very top. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=136.36s)]
*  And whoever is making these decisions, and you just feel like this pressure is gone this Thanksgiving. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=138.36s)]
*  I'm grateful. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=145.36s)]
*  I'm thankful to be the greatest country in the world with a military that knows who it is again, Joey. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=146.36s)]
*  We know who we are again, and that's a big deal. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=152.36s)]
*  Listen, man, I appreciate you joining us today. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=155.36s)]
*  I hope you have a happy Thanksgiving. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=157.36s)]
*  Real quick, what's your message to the country as far as being thankful for the freedoms that we have [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=159.36s)]
*  and the men and women that protect us? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=165.36s)]
*  Well, first of all, you can go to bed and rest, eat as much turkey as you want. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=169.36s)]
*  You've got every 360 degrees as covered by men and women who are willing to do anything for you, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=174.36s)]
*  including the voice you just heard on Fox News who sacrificed so much for us. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=182.36s)]
*  There are millions of Americans that are willing to do anything for our liberty and our freedom. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=187.36s)]
*  And that's why this is the greatest country in the world. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=193.36s)]
*  But more importantly, you should have, and we have the peace and security to know that China and Russia, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=196.36s)]
*  we're not thinking about them. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=203.36s)]
*  I guarantee you tonight they're thinking about us. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=204.36s)]
*  Man, I like it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=207.36s)]
*  I like it a lot. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=208.36s)]
*  David Bellavia, Medal of Honor recipient, but a warrior at heart, man. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=209.36s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_FpMLLhyg&t=213.36s)]
