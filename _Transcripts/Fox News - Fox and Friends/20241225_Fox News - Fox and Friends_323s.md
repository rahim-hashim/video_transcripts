# Joe Concha recaps 2024's most unbelievable political claims from Democrats
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4)
*  24 minutes after the hour now as the year comes to a close, let's look back at some of the most absurd [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=0.0s)]
*  Political moments from 2024 with Fox News contributor Joe Contra [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=5.88s)]
*  He's here to break down the top moments including this from Nancy Pelosi who said Joe Biden was so great so historic [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=10.0s)]
*  He should go here [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  He was in a good place to make whatever decision the top of his game such a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=20.44s)]
*  Consequential president of the United States a Mount Rushmore kind of president of the United States [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=26.36s)]
*  I want to know what comes next that he belongs up there on Mount Rushmore. You can add Biden [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=32.12s)]
*  Add Biden to Mount Rushmore Joe [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=40.0s)]
*  You know, I there's so many ways to go with that. I'll let you take it from here [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=43.36s)]
*  Merry Christmas Casey. Yeah, let's see [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=49.68s)]
*  Washington [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  Jefferson [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=54.2s)]
*  Lincoln Teddy Roosevelt [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=55.36s)]
*  Joe Biden [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=57.92s)]
*  There's one name that seems out of place there. It's like that old Seinfeld line, right? Demagio. Yeah, Ruth [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=59.72s)]
*  You know mantle Costanza [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=66.84s)]
*  Yeah, so look unless we're rewarding presidents for the most pardons and commutations going out the door in history [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=69.72s)]
*  I don't see how mr. Biden the 46th president could get out Mount Rushmore [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=75.78s)]
*  Either way, it's gonna be a very Merry Christmas for many in the country [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=81.36s)]
*  There's a lot of hope and optimism of a new future with the Trump 2.0 [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=84.28s)]
*  Administration coming in and I think a lot of people will be talking about that today [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=88.4s)]
*  After they open the presents Kevin one of these things is not like the other [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=91.56s)]
*  This Kamala is brat. Do you remember this story? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=96.48s)]
*  I mean, I'm I'm fascinated by what that even meant or means even now talk to me about it [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=100.38s)]
*  Well, Brad summer was all part of this time remember July 21st, I remember I was at the Jersey Shore [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=107.28s)]
*  My wife reads a text to me. She says Biden just dropped out and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=113.0s)]
*  She asked me she says so what do you think this means? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  And I said, well, I Kamala Harris is probably gonna be you know [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=119.64s)]
*  The nominee and they're gonna have to just do a complete Etch a sketch on her entire record [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=122.84s)]
*  So what they attempted to do was take the most unpopular vice president in our country's history even more unpopular than Dick Cheney [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=128.12s)]
*  Which is really something because the guy literally shot somebody in the face and just tried to create this whole, you know pop culture icon [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=134.82s)]
*  theme around Kamala Harris [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=142.58s)]
*  We remember the summer of joy she didn't she then went six weeks without taking one question from any reporter [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=144.88s)]
*  And they just tried to remake this person [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=150.54s)]
*  Into somebody that could win the presidency and obviously with Donald Trump winning the popular vote in every swing state that didn't quite work out [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=153.58s)]
*  Unfortunately, yeah, not so much very interesting though. She did change her her profile there on X to Brad [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  Anyway, you know what? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=166.98s)]
*  The media did go crazy over and that was the president-elect the former president and future president [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=168.06s)]
*  When he did his shout out at Mickey D's president Trump over there doling out fries [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=174.38s)]
*  It was a fascinating storyline. I want you to listen to this. I'm gonna get your reaction on the other side [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=181.26s)]
*  What is the logic behind this going to a McDonald's I mean we know the guy likes Big Macs and filet-o-fish [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=186.72s)]
*  There's no logic to it. It's a stump. He has not put forth an economic agenda [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=192.48s)]
*  He as you know is [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=198.64s)]
*  Appears to be not well and he's engaged in some really bizarre types of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  activities during this campaign [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=207.76s)]
*  You know, they just hate because what's the old saying they hate us because they not us [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  It's a brilliant idea. It worked. I think pretty well for him your thoughts. Oh Kevin [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean Democrats are now the party of the elites of the coastal cities [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=219.88s)]
*  Donald Trump is a man of the people and the fact that he trolled Kamala Harris over this [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=225.16s)]
*  Let's put it this way. I have a new book coming out in 2025 [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=230.52s)]
*  It's called the greatest comeback ever inside Trump's big beautiful campaign [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=234.12s)]
*  I'm burdened by what has been and you'll never guess which photo I fought my publishers on to put on the cover [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  It was Donald Trump at the drive-thru waving and smiling that captured the entire [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=244.44s)]
*  Populist campaign and the fact that this time around Donald Trump was a happy warrior [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=249.68s)]
*  And when they tried to paint him as a fascist, then you look at him working at McDonald's you say wait Hitler worked at McDonald's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=254.44s)]
*  Wow, that's that's kind of weird. So yeah, I think that was the masterstroke of the entire campaign [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=259.4s)]
*  Kevin I think so too 15 seconds left your Christmas message my friend as I look at that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=264.04s)]
*  jacket [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=269.56s)]
*  I'm gonna bring in some other guys here. There we go. All right, so that is Liam nine years old [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=270.84s)]
*  That is Cameron 11 years old Kevin [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=275.23999999999995s)]
*  They've appeared on Fox and Friends for Christmas every year for about the past six years and this year is no exception [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=277.02s)]
*  So they're gonna go back up and open some more presents [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=283.88s)]
*  But in the meantime guys you have any Christmas wish for the millions watching out there into the great Kevin cork [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=286.34s)]
*  I want some reading carpenter tickets and an Apple watch and to know what the drone [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=291.96s)]
*  You want to know where the drones are from? That's a very good wish. What do you want? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVCl1x-jSg4&t=297.12s)]
