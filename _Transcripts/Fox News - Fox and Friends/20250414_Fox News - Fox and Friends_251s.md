*  Meantime the Justice Department is striking a defiant tone as a federal judge orders the administration to give daily updates about a Maryland man [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=60.16s)]
*  Who was broadly deported to El Salvador you seem there that judge wants u.s. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=67.92s)]
*  Officials to provide information about kilmar abrigo-garcia's location and what steps the government is taking to bring him back to the u.s [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=72.28s)]
*  but Justice Department officials argue the federal courts have no authority to direct the executive branch to conduct foreign relations in a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  Particular way or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=86.88s)]
*  They understood the Supreme Court's order last week to facilitate a brego-garcia's return as merely removing any domestic obstacles that might impede [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=90.96s)]
*  His return back to the u.s. Steve Ainsley and Lawrence [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=99.08s)]
*  I've got a quick question for you. Yeah, Maddie and that is okay [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  So I read this morning that those ten migrants came from Gitmo [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=105.72s)]
*  But then but then I read a couple of weeks ago [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=110.0s)]
*  It sounds like all the migrants who were being held at Gitmo back then like in March were taken to another facility in Louisiana [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=113.44s)]
*  So do you have any clarity? Are there a bunch of people at Gitmo still? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  You know all I have right now is that reporting from the New York Times of the Venezuelans or rather the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  migrants who arrived in El Salvador over the weekend came from Gitmo [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=131.6s)]
*  But as for more information regarding whether more migrants are being held there we'll have to look into it [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  But you're right what I'm getting right now is from that New York Times article as well Steve. Okay, very good. That's all we know [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=139.85999999999999s)]
*  Thank you Trump on truth social. Thank you, Maddie Trump on truth social said these barbarians are now in the sole custody of El Salvador [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=145.22s)]
*  A proud and sovereign nation and their future is up to the president be and his government [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  They will never threaten or menace our citizens again [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=157.17999999999998s)]
*  Well also the Trump administration to that point [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  Ainsley because this all started with the first few flights that went over across and the Trump administration if you look at that court family [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  They're not budging an inch and it all goes back to what the Supreme Court said the Supreme Court said hey [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=170.44s)]
*  You know, this was an error [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=176.5s)]
*  Do what you can to bring him back, but we don't have the authority talking about the guy Marilyn [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=178.86s)]
*  That's exactly right [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=183.62s)]
*  We don't have the authority to go to the executive branch and make them do foreign policy [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=184.42s)]
*  and I think the administration has pretty much put a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=189.86s)]
*  You know a marker through the sand and said they're not gonna budge now that that court did say they want daily updates [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=192.86s)]
*  So he's gonna drag [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=200.58s)]
*  The administration to court every single day for an update until I think he gets what he wants [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=202.62s)]
*  I think this ultimately is gonna go back to the Supreme Court as someone because there was so so much ambiguity there with the word [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=207.82s)]
*  Facilitate we have to facilitate bringing him home right and the administration has said, you know, we can't get him back [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=214.26s)]
*  But you know, there are ways they could do it. But obviously they are testing the judicial system [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=220.26s)]
*  They're seeing how far they can go and there's mr. Garcia right there. Yeah, we've got the Secretary of Homeland Security [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=225.7s)]
*  Kristi Noem is gonna be joining us just about two hours from right now [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=231.42s)]
*  We've got lots of questions for her about what is going on in her gigantic department that she had I'm Steve Ducey [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdoClG3xzQ&t=234.5s)]
