# Growing caravan heads for US border in finals months of Biden admin
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ)
*  least 1500 migrants are rushing to our southern border trying to make it before president-elect [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump takes office and those migrants on the march as the Biden administration quietly [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  loosens immigration policies before they go. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=10.48s)]
*  Griff Jenkins joins us now for more. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=13.92s)]
*  Hey Griff. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=15.8s)]
*  Hey good morning guys. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=16.8s)]
*  Here they come. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=17.8s)]
*  This is the sixth caravan coming out of southern Mexico in the past few months and it's clear [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=18.8s)]
*  that Mexico's new president, Claudia Scheinbaum, is doing little to stop them. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=22.88s)]
*  Take a look here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=28.060000000000002s)]
*  As you can see it is 1500 strong and growing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=29.099999999999998s)]
*  The caravan's leader Luis Villagran told me yesterday he's encouraging these migrants [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=31.299999999999997s)]
*  to march on despite the incoming Trump administration's threat to deport them and the migrants seem [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=35.94s)]
*  unafraid. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=41.42s)]
*  I watched an interview where Trump said there will be a deportation of anyone who committed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=42.42s)]
*  a crime from any country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=49.04s)]
*  But for an immigrant who hasn't committed any crime there won't be a deportation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=51.26s)]
*  So I'm not afraid of anything. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=55.34s)]
*  Whatever happens the dream is the American dream and to be there. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=57.02s)]
*  This caravan comes as Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens yesterday said in the past 51 [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=60.84s)]
*  days they have already arrested 20 sex offenders at the southern border, three child sex offenders [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=65.86s)]
*  in just the last 72 hours and guys those are just the ones we know about. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=71.7s)]
*  Don't forget about the gotaways. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile ICE sources confirmed to me yesterday they are rolling out an ICE portal app here [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=78.22s)]
*  near New York and a few other cities allowing migrants to skip in-person check-ins to their [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=83.58s)]
*  local ICE office. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  They say it's needed due to the overwhelming backlog of in-person appointments which goes [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=89.62s)]
*  back five, ten years and get this ICE sources also told me they wanted to make it public [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=94.64s)]
*  but their DHS bosses stopped them from putting out anything to the press on it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=100.82s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=105.78s)]
*  Not surprising. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=106.78s)]
*  Yeah they totally shut down their press operation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=107.78s)]
*  Hey Griff, why do you think this caravan, what could you tell us, how intact do you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=110.02000000000001s)]
*  think it's going to be being that you are in contact with the leader by the time it [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=115.14s)]
*  gets here? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=118.94000000000001s)]
*  Well, we'll see what happens Brian and you know they're in Huitzla, that's where they [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=119.94000000000001s)]
*  are in Mexico. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=124.4s)]
*  It's the northern city in the Chiapas southern state down there and the migrants often break [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=125.4s)]
*  apart once they get out of that Chiapas state after they leave Huitzla and part of the reason [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=133.12s)]
*  why they do that Brian is because the smugglers pick them up there and try and offer them [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=138.6s)]
*  ways to pay to move quickly to our southern border and I will be willing to bet, although [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=143.92s)]
*  I'm not there so I don't know for sure, but I'm willing to bet that the smugglers are [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=148.44s)]
*  offering premiums for top dollar to hurry up and get there because of the concern that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=151.6s)]
*  under the Trump administration they're not going to have the success they've had over [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=158.04s)]
*  the past four years. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  They know all the routes and how to get there. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  Looks like it's already been cut in half as well Griff. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=164.24s)]
*  Great job. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=166.44s)]
*  Last question, the new Mexican president, how does she feel about illegal immigration? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=167.44s)]
*  Will she be able to deal with Trump? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=172.28s)]
*  Do you think like Obrador for all his faults did him and Trump did hit it off and they [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=174.8s)]
*  did work together? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=179.4s)]
*  You know it's fascinating you asked that and it's a great question. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=180.68s)]
*  It's the $64,000 question Brian because Claudia Scheinbaum, Mexico's new president took over [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=183.76s)]
*  a few months ago. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=188.92s)]
*  She's really holding her cards close to her chest because she knows she's going to have [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=190.36s)]
*  to negotiate something with the incoming president Trump because he intends to reinstall that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=193.28s)]
*  remain in Mexico and that requires Mexico's cooperation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=200.28s)]
*  So far she has not been strong. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=204.48s)]
*  So far she's done little to stop these... [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=206.6s)]
*  This is 6-1 that's taken off under her leadership. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=208.48s)]
*  She's going to be introduced to something called tariffs if she doesn't cooperate and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=211.2s)]
*  it's going to hurt their economy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=215.44s)]
*  When you look at the migrants that are crossing, thank you Griff, when you look at just the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=216.88s)]
*  hundreds, thousands of migrants that are walking toward our border, we don't know who they [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=220.48s)]
*  are and in that crowd could be some criminals and that's our biggest fear especially as [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=223.96s)]
*  women and a lady who works for Alvin Bragg, she's the assistant DA. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=231.6s)]
*  She's 38 years old, she was going home to her apartment on Sunday early in the morning [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=236.2s)]
*  at 2 o'clock in the morning, she walks into her apartment complex and in the hallway is [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=240.88s)]
*  this guy doing a lewd act. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=245.28s)]
*  You can imagine what he's doing to himself. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=247.5s)]
*  She sees him and then he, she says he robs her and he takes her phone and they were able [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=249.3s)]
*  to track him to one of these migrant shelters. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=254.48s)]
*  So Alvin Bragg in his office, Mr. Put Illegal Criminals First, who wants to prosecute Danny [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=256.66s)]
*  Penney and President Trump and do you think he has any regrets? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=263.14s)]
*  This is the bile that are here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=267.5s)]
*  They're making fun of our laws because they understand that they're going to be right [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=269.62s)]
*  back out on the street. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=273.7s)]
*  They're not going to be held in custody much longer. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=275.18s)]
*  Because they did put him out without fail right away. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=277.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=280.26s)]
*  It's just crazy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=281.26s)]
*  She's lucky to be alive. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  They caught him, they tracked her cell phone because he took her phone and they nabbed [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=285.54s)]
*  him at the Roe Hotel migrant shelter in Midtown. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=290.62s)]
*  It turns out his home address according to the, I think it's the post, the article I [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=293.54s)]
*  was reading, his hometown is in Queens at one of the migrant shelters so he's here illegally. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=297.86s)]
*  With his debit card that we're giving him because they didn't like the food that was [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=302.86s)]
*  given to them and they were throwing it out so we decided to give them debit cards so [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=306.9s)]
*  they can have it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=311.14s)]
*  Has Alvin Bragg said anything about this? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=312.14s)]
*  Yeah, but by the way that's probably why he's in jail because he hit one of somebody in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=313.42s)]
*  his office. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=317.26s)]
*  But it was okay to hit one of us. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=318.26s)]
*  But it's happened to average day New Yorkers every day. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=319.26s)]
*  And by the way the GOP is standing up speaking out in Massachusetts about the governor making [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=322.42s)]
*  those ignorant remarks about illegal immigrants going to protect them. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=326.38s)]
*  We're not going to cooperate with ICE. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=330.42s)]
*  Republicans are beginning to, even though they're not a lot of them, they're beginning [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=331.94s)]
*  to speak out and talk about the embarrassment of their mayor and governor when it comes [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=335.05999999999995s)]
*  to illegal immigrants. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=338.7s)]
*  And when they're arrested they're laughing, they're smirking. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=339.7s)]
*  Remember the guy in Midtown? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=341.17999999999995s)]
*  He flicked off the camera. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=342.53999999999996s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=344.02s)]
*  They smirked and laughed there as well. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=345.02s)]
*  These are guys that are shot at cops and they're laughing about it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=346.78s)]
*  We let them out too by the way. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J2h6m7htQ&t=350.05999999999995s)]
