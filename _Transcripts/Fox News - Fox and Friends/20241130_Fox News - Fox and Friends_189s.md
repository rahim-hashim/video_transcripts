# Sheriff details how local authorities will aid Trump's border crackdown
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg)
*  Yeah, one of those local officials stepping up is Butler County, Ohio Sheriff Richard [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=0.0s)]
*  Jones. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=5.22s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=6.22s)]
*  Sheriff, good morning. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=7.22s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=8.22s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=9.22s)]
*  When we look at this policy, it's called 287G. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=10.22s)]
*  It's a federal policy that could be expanded apparently. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=15.32s)]
*  Explain to us what you would be able to do under this that you're not able to do now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=18.66s)]
*  We could actually go to the workplace and enforce immigration laws. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  We had it once before, but this president took it all away from all the sheriffs across [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=28.6s)]
*  the country. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=32.96s)]
*  We housed prisoners here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  There's two 287Gs, one to hold prisoners, one to go out and enforce immigration laws. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=36.08s)]
*  We were trained. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  We had the certification and President Biden's administration took it all away from us. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  We're going to get that back. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=49.72s)]
*  We've been in contact with ICE. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=50.8s)]
*  So it gives us the authority to go out into the community, to go to the workplace, enforce [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=53.4s)]
*  these laws, and help the federal government do their job. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=58.96s)]
*  And we're happy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  We're getting geared up. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  We're making jail space available. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=66.84s)]
*  And one thing I know about illegal immigration, I've been doing this 20 years, is when you [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  start going out and enforcing and apprehending people that are here illegally and enforcing [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=75.92s)]
*  the laws where people work in these factories illegally, we've got citizens. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=81.0s)]
*  I had a lady that came to me and was given information where these places are. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=86.52s)]
*  All over the United States, sheriffs, there's 3,300 sheriffs in the United States. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  Each county, it's easier to deal with one local law enforcement in each county as it [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  is thousands and thousands of police departments. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=104.16s)]
*  Yeah, you know, you talk about all over the country, sheriffs are stepping up. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=107.72s)]
*  You're in Ohio. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=111.64s)]
*  That's not a border town. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=112.64s)]
*  That's not down on the southwest border. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  Tell us about how this problem is affecting you there in Butler County. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=116.0s)]
*  Basically, I have had 2,000 illegals in my jail in the past three years. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=119.88s)]
*  And I had another lady come up to me. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  Her husband was killed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=131.76s)]
*  She had kids and was killed by an illegal drive in a car, overstayed his visa. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  We're borders with Canada, the northern border in Ohio. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  So and that has picked up tenfold with the drugs. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  The president of Canada lets these people come in, lets the drugs come in, lets the kids come in. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  It's a travesty. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=153.16s)]
*  They're coming in, they're pouring in. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=154.56s)]
*  But what we're going to do when we had 287G before, we're going to actually enforce [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=156.48s)]
*  workplace enforcement, hopefully. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=161.76s)]
*  And listen, I had the federal government come in and go to federal court and testify against me [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=164.32s)]
*  for trying to enforce workplace enforcement with illegals working there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=170.4s)]
*  Sheriff Richard Jones, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=175.68s)]
*  Thank you for all the work you're doing to keep your community safe. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=178.64s)]
*  And I look forward to seeing the good work you're going to be able to do under this next administration. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=180.88s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=184.96s)]
*  Thank you, my friend. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=186.84s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNPznmUcSBg&t=188.0s)]
