# Trump admin shuts down possibility of NATO membership for Ukraine
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo)
*  So today marks three years since the start of the war in Ukraine and French President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=0.0s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron will be at the White House today where he's expected to urge President [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=8.64s)]
*  Trump to do more for Ukraine in those peace talks. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=12.76s)]
*  And now Ukrainian President Zelensky is even offering to step down if it will secure peace [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=16.12s)]
*  in NATO membership for his country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=23.8s)]
*  Joining us now is a key figure in those negotiations. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=26.48s)]
*  President Trump's National Security Advisor Michael Waltz. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=29.56s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=32.48s)]
*  Yeah thank you Lawrence, good to be with you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=36.64s)]
*  So tell me what's the latest on these peace talks? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=38.56s)]
*  Are y'all close to a deal? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=41.64s)]
*  I know Secretary Rubio said that you know you guys had a deal that was going to go to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=43.8s)]
*  the parliament but then Zelensky said something different to the public. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=49.12s)]
*  So have you guys reached some sort of deal right now? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=53.96s)]
*  Yeah listen the negotiations are literally happening as we speak. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=61.08s)]
*  We have been all hands on deck. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=65.74s)]
*  Secretary Besant, our Treasury Secretary has been leading the charge and frustrations are [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=68.18s)]
*  high frankly. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=75.32s)]
*  The United States has stepped forward for Ukraine in a historic and tremendous way. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=77.72000000000001s)]
*  We are heading today into the three year anniversary of this war and we expect the Ukrainians to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=84.94000000000001s)]
*  realize the opportunity that this is and President Zelensky to realize the opportunity that this [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=93.28s)]
*  is to be co-invested with the United States of America in the future of Ukraine, in the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=98.92000000000002s)]
*  future of its economy and growing the pie in terms of its natural resources that not [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=104.76s)]
*  only helps Ukraine but recoups these hundreds of billions of dollars for the Ukrainian people [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=112.44s)]
*  and for the American taxpayer going forward. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=118.0s)]
*  So we expect to get this deal done. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=121.44s)]
*  President Trump expects to get this deal done and I think you will see that in very short [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  order. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=130.32s)]
*  So it looks like the conversation, he was asked the question of Zelensky, the President [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=131.92s)]
*  of Ukraine about NATO membership and he said he is willing to step down. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=136.92s)]
*  Now the Secretary of Defense Pete Hex has said that is not realistic. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  I have talked to the President. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=144.88s)]
*  He has pretty much said the same thing in private and public. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=146.32s)]
*  Is that back on the table? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=149.88s)]
*  Because he was asked that question and he said that he would be willing to step down. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=151.76s)]
*  That is not back on the table. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=156.5s)]
*  I do not see the United States having Ukraine enter into NATO and then having United States [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  troops essentially obligated immediately in terms of Article 5 or coming, to have U.S. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=167.84s)]
*  troops coming directly in for the defense of Ukraine. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=178.24s)]
*  That is very different. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=182.82s)]
*  I want to be clear on that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=183.82s)]
*  We have President Macron coming. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=185.08s)]
*  We have Prime Minister Stammer of the United Kingdom coming. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=186.88s)]
*  That is very different than the U.S. commitment to NATO and existing NATO countries. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=190.76s)]
*  We are absolutely committed to NATO writ large, our Article 5 treaty agreements with other [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=196.04s)]
*  NATO countries, but the security guarantees for Ukraine is a different conversation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=204.6s)]
*  One of the things that we fully support is both France and the United Kingdom and other [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=210.66s)]
*  Europeans saying they would be willing to enter into very strong security guarantees [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=216.36s)]
*  for the future of Ukraine. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=222.04s)]
*  That is a different conversation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=224.2s)]
*  That is one that we are encouraged by because, Lawrence, we have been asking for years for [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=225.2s)]
*  Europe to step up for its own defense and we have been asking for years for Europe to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=231.44s)]
*  pay for its own defense as the U.S. taxpayer has been taking an unfair burden into for [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=236.64s)]
*  decades now. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=243.76s)]
*  Congressman, I want to go into the specifics of the minerals, but before I do that, I [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=245.0s)]
*  want to talk about this meeting with Putin. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  I guess my question is, is there a meeting on the calendar? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=250.92s)]
*  I know you had previously said that the meeting will happen once there is something to actually [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  discuss that you guys have talked about a deal. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=258.56s)]
*  So is there something on the calendar for the president to meet with Putin in person? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=261.56s)]
*  Not at this moment. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=269.72s)]
*  We are having a series of negotiations and engagements at my level and below. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=270.72s)]
*  We are having a back and forth on kind of what things would look like going forward, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=280.20000000000005s)]
*  not only to get us to a ceasefire in Ukraine, but what a broader U.S.-Russia relationship [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=287.44000000000005s)]
*  would look like going forward. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=293.86s)]
*  An important first step is Secretary Rubio and his counterpart Lavrov in getting our [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=295.64s)]
*  embassies back functioning again. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=304.2s)]
*  It's very difficult, Lawrence, to move the relationship forward if we don't have functioning [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=306.52s)]
*  embassies. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=311.32s)]
*  This is the president talking about the mineral deal. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  Let's play a little bit. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  We're going to get our money back because it's not fair. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  It's just not fair. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=320.64s)]
*  We will see, but I think we're pretty close to a deal and we better be close to a deal [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=323.52s)]
*  because that has been a horrible situation. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=329.48s)]
*  So tell me specifically, Congressman, what does a mineral deal look like? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=332.12s)]
*  Does that mean that America, by extension, if we get these minerals, that we're going [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=337.2s)]
*  to guard our minerals as well? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  Are we talking about a large portion of minerals, part of Ukraine? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=344.12s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=348.46s)]
*  For example, there is enough aluminum if their refineries were fully capable, if we had that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=352.12s)]
*  outside investment, for U.S. imports for an entire year. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=361.6s)]
*  There's enough gallium, there's enough tritium, there's titanium, one of the largest titanium [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=366.48s)]
*  reserves in all of Europe. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=372.36s)]
*  But that will take investment to get it to full capacity. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=374.78000000000003s)]
*  Our position has been, look, 50 percent of something that is much larger, growing the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=378.64s)]
*  pie, is better than the 100 percent of where they are today. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=384.36s)]
*  So let's grow together in an economic partnership. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=389.32s)]
*  And of course, the U.S. would protect our assets for which we are invested in. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=393.0s)]
*  This could mean trillions, not only for the Ukrainian people, but for us and for stability [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=397.38s)]
*  for the region. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=402.84s)]
*  And that economic investment is one of the best security guarantees that Ukraine could [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=403.84s)]
*  hope for. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=408.46s)]
*  You know, Congressman, before I let you go, I've got to talk about the Israel Hamas deal. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=409.46s)]
*  And it looks like they're asking for an extension here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=413.14s)]
*  Last week, something tragic happened. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=416.78s)]
*  They sent the bodies back, three bodies, two of them were the children, but the mother [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=418.26s)]
*  was not there. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=423.79999999999995s)]
*  They have since brought the mom back home. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=424.79999999999995s)]
*  It doesn't look like Hamas is being an honest broker here. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=428.85999999999996s)]
*  And I know the president has said previously, all hell is going to break loose in the Middle [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=433.41999999999996s)]
*  East. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=438.58s)]
*  Is Hamas listening to the president? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=439.58s)]
*  Oh, Hamas has listened to the president. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=441.58s)]
*  Remind you and everyone, Lawrence, that we wouldn't even be in this position. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=445.7s)]
*  Twenty nine hostages are alive today and reunited with their families because the whole world [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=450.78s)]
*  listened when President Trump said they'd be all held to pay after the Biden administration [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  couldn't get this done for 15 months. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=462.32s)]
*  So absolutely they are. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=464.91999999999996s)]
*  They are afraid of President Trump, period. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=466.90000000000003s)]
*  And that's why we've seen any movement at all. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=470.36s)]
*  But is has their behavior been despicable? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=472.58000000000004s)]
*  Has it been disgusting? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=475.38s)]
*  Should it surprise anyone? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=476.66s)]
*  This is a terrorist organization, no different than ISIS. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=477.96000000000004s)]
*  And really, the needle we're trying to thread right now is getting all of our hostages out. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=481.90000000000003s)]
*  At the same time, though, Hamas will not rule Gaza, period. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=489.24s)]
*  They have a couple of off ramps that we put on the table, but Hamas will not rule Gaza. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=493.8s)]
*  They will not cause another October 7th. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=500.08s)]
*  And we will work with Israel to make sure that doesn't happen. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=502.42s)]
*  Anybody that knows the president, I don't think it's best to call his bluff. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=505.88s)]
*  Thank you, Coxman. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=509.56s)]
*  I appreciate you. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUuNtva7kBo&t=510.56s)]
