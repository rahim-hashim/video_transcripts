# Biden-Harris admin removed Trump border policies 'out of spite': Patty Morin
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0)
*  Gary, Rachel Moran, Lakin Riley, they are young women who were brutally assaulted and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=0.0s)]
*  killed by some of the men who were released at the beginning of the administration. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=6.66s)]
*  Do you owe those families an apology? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=10.34s)]
*  Let me just say, first of all, those are tragic cases. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=14.42s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=18.7s)]
*  There is no question about that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=21.22s)]
*  And I can't imagine the pain that the families of those victims have experienced for a loss [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=23.42s)]
*  that should not have occurred. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=30.980000000000004s)]
*  So that is true. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=33.96s)]
*  It is also true that if a border security had actually been passed nine months ago, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=37.260000000000005s)]
*  it would be nine months that we would have had more border agents at the border, more [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=43.06s)]
*  support for the folks who are working around the clock trying to hold it all together. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=49.42s)]
*  Madam Vice President. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=54.06s)]
*  To ensure that no future harm would occur. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=55.06s)]
*  And this election in 20 days will determine whether we have a president of the United [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=59.7s)]
*  States who actually cares more about fixing a problem, even if it is not to their political [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=65.22s)]
*  advantage in an election, because there was a solution, Brett. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=71.5s)]
*  In her first formal sit down interview with Fox News, Vice President Kamala Harris facing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=77.22s)]
*  questions on migrant crime on their watch, the administration, including the tragic case [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=81.48s)]
*  of Rachel Morin, a Maryland mother of five who was allegedly murdered by an illegal migrant. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=87.86s)]
*  Rachel's mother, Patty, joins us right now from Maryland. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=95.18s)]
*  Patty, good morning to you. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=98.14s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=100.94s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=101.94s)]
*  You bet. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=102.94s)]
*  She never answered the question. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=104.62s)]
*  Brett was asking, do you owe an apology to the families? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=105.98s)]
*  Does she? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=110.30000000000001s)]
*  I think that she does. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=113.06s)]
*  I think that actions speak louder than words. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=114.62s)]
*  And she's had almost four years to prove her mettle. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=118.4s)]
*  And by her actions, I would say that she puts illegal immigrants above the American people. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=122.9s)]
*  And she has allowed all these deaths to happen on her watch. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=130.06s)]
*  Well, you know, during the interview, and I'm sure you saw it, whenever there was a [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=133.57999999999998s)]
*  question, uncomfortable question regarding the border and migration, she would pivot [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=138.18s)]
*  back to, well, Donald Trump torpedoed that border bill. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=142.56s)]
*  Your daughter was murdered over a year ago, and the border bill was not brought up and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=147.01999999999998s)]
*  discussed until May of this year. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=153.76s)]
*  So it would not have saved your daughter's life. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=156.66s)]
*  It would not. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=161.56s)]
*  And I think the only reason why they tried to push this border bill was to save face [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=162.66s)]
*  because they knew that this invasion happened on their watch and willfully, I believe it [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=168.44s)]
*  happened. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  And then also, if the American people actually read the bill, they would see that the majority [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=176.34s)]
*  of the money was going to foreign interests like Ukraine and Israel, and very little was [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=182.82s)]
*  actually going to the border. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=188.06s)]
*  And what went to the border was to actually facilitate bringing more illegal immigrants [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=189.78s)]
*  into the country, not securing and closing the border. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=195.42s)]
*  As we look at your beautiful family, Patty, these images, do you blame the Biden administration [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=198.74s)]
*  for the death of your girl? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=206.66s)]
*  I do. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=210.02s)]
*  And the reason why I do is because there were policies that were already in place. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=211.28s)]
*  You don't need to change the law. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=216.9s)]
*  You're the president, vice president. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=218.62s)]
*  Those policies were in place. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=220.98000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Trump had them in place and they revoke them all more out of spite towards Mr. Trump, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=222.26s)]
*  I believe, than anything. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=229.5s)]
*  And they completely opened up our border to a massive invasion of illegal immigrants like [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=232.06s)]
*  none ever seen in the history of our country. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=240.02s)]
*  So yes, I completely and totally blame them. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=244.36s)]
*  So she wouldn't answer whether or not she owed an apology. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=247.78s)]
*  She said it was tragic, but she did say, I can't imagine the pain these families experience. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=251.42s)]
*  Patty, tell her the pain your family's experienced. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=256.94s)]
*  Oh my gosh, man, if I start telling you the pain, I'm going to be crying. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=261.14s)]
*  This past weekend, I went down to Kentucky. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=267.74s)]
*  It was a little over a year ago when my daughter, we heard the news that my daughter had passed. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=270.94s)]
*  I was in Kentucky because a grandbaby had passed. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=277.3s)]
*  And to sit with my family a year later and to see them still mourning the death not only [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=280.82s)]
*  of their own child, but their sister, and to speak to the other mom and listen to her [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=286.14s)]
*  pain, it was heartbreaking. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=292.7s)]
*  It was heartbreaking for me because now I understood, at the time I didn't understand [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=296.5s)]
*  the loss of a child. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  And now I understand that loss. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=304.53999999999996s)]
*  And it's something that never goes away. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=306.73999999999995s)]
*  Some days, I mean, you're okay, but there never goes a day by, that was poor English, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=309.97999999999996s)]
*  where I don't think about Rachel, I don't cry for Rachel, I don't think about her children. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=317.85999999999996s)]
*  And there's never a day, and I've talked to people that have lost children and they said [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=325.34s)]
*  the pain never goes away, that I'm going to walk with it the rest of my life. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=328.9s)]
*  It's an unbearable thing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=334.42s)]
*  I want to feel happy again. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=335.74s)]
*  And I don't know how to do that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=338.46000000000004s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=341.18s)]
*  No, that's real. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=343.18s)]
*  That's how you feel. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=345.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=347.18s)]
*  It's like, this should not be. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=348.18s)]
*  And if they had secured the borders and just American people should come first, that's [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=351.70000000000005s)]
*  why we elect these officials, to protect our country, not to open the border and allow [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=357.70000000000005s)]
*  all these sworn enemies of our country into our country and then give them aid and comfort [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=364.02000000000004s)]
*  above the American people. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=372.26s)]
*  That's just not right. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=374.22s)]
*  It isn't right. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=377.22s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=378.22s)]
*  Patty, thank you very much. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=379.22s)]
*  You're welcome, sir. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=380.22s)]
*  God bless you and your family. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=381.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=386.94s)]
*  Bye. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42YmohCoFT0&t=387.94s)]
