# Doocy: This is a remarkable move
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk)
*  All right, it's 6 a.m. on the East Coast and it's Monday, December the 2nd and this is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=0.0s)]
*  Fox and friend. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  It is indeed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  All right, folks, Fox News alert. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  You saw this. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=9.6s)]
*  I'm sure President Biden has pardoned his son Hunter of any offenses from the past decade, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=10.6s)]
*  despite Joe Biden's many promises to the American public that when something like this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=16.88s)]
*  A pardon for your son? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=21.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=24.28s)]
*  I said I'd fight by the jury decision. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=25.28s)]
*  Plus, this morning, closing arguments begin in Daniel Penny's subway choke hold trial. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=28.28s)]
*  We will take you to the courthouse as the Marine veteran faces up to 15 years in prison [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=37.84s)]
*  if convicted. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=42.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=43.6s)]
*  And the migrant crisis by the numbers as President-elect Trump gets ready to for his day one border [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=44.6s)]
*  action kind of those days are started already, it seems, where 182 billion taxpayer dollars [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  have gone. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=55.32s)]
*  That's the big question. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=56.32s)]
*  Fox and friends starts right now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=57.56s)]
*  We start with a Fox News alert. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=63.6s)]
*  President Biden pardoning his son Hunter last night, excusing any offenses the first son [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=65.0s)]
*  might have committed over the past decade. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=70.44s)]
*  That's a long time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=73.6s)]
*  Madeline Rivera joins us right now from Washington, D.C. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=75.12s)]
*  Madeline, you know, even though Joe Biden said he's not going to do it, not going to do it, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=78.52s)]
*  we all knew he was going to do it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=83.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's really such a major reversal for this president, Steve. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=85.55999999999999s)]
*  So the White House Press Secretary, Korean Jean-Pierre, said as recently as last month [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=89.32s)]
*  the president wouldn't commute his son's sentence or pardon him, yet he did so anyway because [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  he said Hunter's charges were meant to break him politically. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=97.08s)]
*  The president's saying, in part, here's the truth. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=100.8s)]
*  I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=102.72s)]
*  politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=107.0s)]
*  Hunter was found guilty in June on three federal gun charges. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=112.28s)]
*  In September, he pled guilty to nine federal tax charges. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  He was supposed to have sentencing hearings on December 12th for his gun case and December [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=119.06s)]
*  16th for his tax case. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  All of those now gone. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=125.56s)]
*  But the president's pardon doesn't just cover these offenses. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=127.56s)]
*  It covers any crime the first son may have committed between January 2014 to December [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=130.38s)]
*  2024. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=135.64s)]
*  And that timeframe is notable given that Hunter joined the board of Burisma Holdings [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=136.64s)]
*  in 2014 and he has been scrutinized for his foreign business dealings. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=140.92s)]
*  It also shows a degree of contempt for the American people. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  This is a president who didn't just simply lie about not ever speaking to his [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=152.16s)]
*  his son's business associates, of never being in meetings with them. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=157.8s)]
*  But he lied repeatedly to the American people when he was a candidate for [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=164.0s)]
*  reelection. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=169.32s)]
*  The president says he made this decision over the weekend while spending the Thanksgiving [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=172.16s)]
*  holiday with his family in Nantucket. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=175.76s)]
*  But NBC, which was the first to report this news, says the president had been talking [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=177.72s)]
*  about the possibility of pardoning Hunter with close aides as far back as June when [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=182.12s)]
*  Hunter was convicted on those gun charges. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=186.64s)]
*  All right, Steve, right. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=189.12s)]
*  And thank you so much, Maddie. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=190.12s)]
*  It's interesting that the pardon starts on January 1st, 2014. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=191.72s)]
*  He joined Burisma, the board of Burisma, four months after that in April. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  So this goes back to Joe Biden being the vice president. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=200.44s)]
*  Something else I found interesting in the president's remarks in his, you know, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=203.04s)]
*  paragraphs full of his pardon, how he believes his son was treated differently and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  singled out because his dad was the president. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=213.16s)]
*  He said, quote, I have followed a simple principle. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=215.48s)]
*  Just tell the American people the truth. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, he lied. He did. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=221.32s)]
*  He lied to us. He said he wasn't going to pardon him. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  But part of his pardon statement is say, tell the truth. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=225.68s)]
*  Yeah, but that easily that's because according to Joe Biden, those those mean [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=230.12s)]
*  Republicans came after him and ultimately, I think the reason it's a 10 year [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=234.24s)]
*  span is, you know, I was talking to somebody in law enforcement yesterday. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=241.28s)]
*  They said it's almost an implicit admission of guilt, acknowledging there is [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=245.44s)]
*  criminal adjacent stuff that has gone on charge. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=249.72s)]
*  Also, you know, ultimately, this means nobody can go after Hunter for anything, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=254.04s)]
*  anything he did during that 10 year period. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=260.4s)]
*  Essentially money to the big guy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=263.28s)]
*  Well, any of it, it is essentially a remarkable get out of jail free card. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=264.88s)]
*  So I would say, number one, it can't be true because he said repeatedly over and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=273.44s)]
*  over again, I'm not going to I'm not going to pardon my son, Hunter. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=276.56s)]
*  And he also says he's got great trust in the criminal justice system. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=281.36s)]
*  However, in this case, I've watched it selectively and unfairly prosecuted. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=284.4s)]
*  What do you can't have it both ways. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=288.24s)]
*  And number two is you want to go he's going under the guise of addiction. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=290.08s)]
*  What addiction do you need to have to do a deal with the Romanian billionaire to go [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=293.52s)]
*  to the Moscow mayor's wife, to go into China and meet with a billionaire and come [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=297.64s)]
*  out with millions of dollars? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=302.08s)]
*  What type of crack do you use to not pay taxes ever? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=303.6s)]
*  And then what kind of crack to which must be supplied from somebody? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=307.12s)]
*  Do you all of a sudden some producer comes out of Hollywood from nowhere and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  pays all your bills plus interest? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  Who is paying that producer? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=316.24s)]
*  And what did you ever, ever get to the bottom of what Joe Biden lied [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  multiple times about having nothing to do with his son's overseas business dealings? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  You remember that? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  At the same time, we find out about him having dinner with his business partners, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=328.8s)]
*  calling into an international business deal in Ukraine just to check on his son. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=332.04s)]
*  This is the same pattern to use with Ukraine. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=336.04s)]
*  I'm not going to give him high marks. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=338.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to give him high marks. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=340.0s)]
*  I'm not going to give him F-16s. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=341.12s)]
*  I'm going to give him F-16s. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=342.36s)]
*  I'm not going to give him a tag. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=343.64s)]
*  I'm going to give him a tag. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=344.72s)]
*  I'm not going to let him hit in Moscow. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=345.92s)]
*  I let him hit in Moscow. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=347.16s)]
*  He gets a pass all the time on this and now all bets are off. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=348.24s)]
*  Next time someone says he's the next George Washington, please remember some of this. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=352.48s)]
*  Well, the thing is that we all knew he was going to do it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=358.28s)]
*  And I don't think that's really the issue here is that he's pardoned his son. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=361.44s)]
*  It's that he lied about it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=365.36s)]
*  And they expected us to believe that he was this noble guy and that he was going to restore [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=366.88s)]
*  order to the Department of Justice. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  Suddenly the criminal justice system has unfairly targeted his son. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=374.88s)]
*  You can't have it both ways, as Brian says. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=379.68s)]
*  Either the criminal justice system is broken in totality or they aren't. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=381.36s)]
*  You can't say in this particular... [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=387.72s)]
*  But I just got to say though, you don't have to take our word for it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=389.92s)]
*  The federal judge that was going to oversee this sweetheart deal literally looked over [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=393.8s)]
*  to the prosecution and said, is there any precedent for a deal like this? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  They said no. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  Then they looked over to the defense, his own lawyers, they asked him. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=403.40000000000003s)]
*  She says, is there any precedent for the deal? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=406.92s)]
*  They said no. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  So if there's anything, they tried to give him special treatment in the criminal justice system. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=409.92s)]
*  Right, you know, and you just brought up such a good point because in that sweetheart deal, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=415.40000000000003s)]
*  there was the extraordinary part, and this is why Judge Norica said, hey, is there precedent [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=420.12s)]
*  for this? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=424.88s)]
*  The deal said anything he did... [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=425.88s)]
*  And purportuities. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=428.91999999999996s)]
*  Right, anything he did then or in the future. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=429.91999999999996s)]
*  So that was, they got greedy. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=433.64s)]
*  They wanted too much. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=435.8s)]
*  And now we have clearly seen that they had this planned all along. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=437.84s)]
*  Of course, I think Joe probably thought Hunter would skate on the charges initially, but [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=442.5s)]
*  then after he was convicted, he faced 25 years. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  Can I ask you all a question? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=449.92s)]
*  Your dads, all of us had strong dads, right? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=451.72s)]
*  Or have strong dads. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=454.66s)]
*  My dad always told me, Ainsley, if you get arrested, don't call me. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm not your first phone call. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=459.12s)]
*  I'm leaving you in there. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  If you did something that's that bad, then you need to stay. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=461.44s)]
*  I'm not saying he shouldn't pardon his son. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=464.52000000000004s)]
*  Most, I guess, dads would do that, but his son had every opportunity. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=466.88s)]
*  He grew up in a family of privilege. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=473.12s)]
*  He grew up in a family where he had every opportunity and he squandered it by not paying [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=475.24s)]
*  his taxes, by being addicted to crack cocaine. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=479.48s)]
*  And so when you look at his story, it's like, right? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  Many of us would have loved to have had, you know, we did it by pulling up our bootstraps [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=486.56s)]
*  and doing it the hard way, by working really hard and getting to where we wanted to be. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=490.26s)]
*  He had every opportunity that most sons don't have. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=494.28000000000003s)]
*  And now his dad is pardoning him and saying like, it's okay, he did it because of me, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  my influence. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=501.36s)]
*  Well, his dad had superpowers, has superpowers for 50 more days. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=502.36s)]
*  And he's doing what a lot of parents would do. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=505.48s)]
*  They're bailing out their son if they can, even though he's acknowledged, you know, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=507.6s)]
*  he broke the law. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=511.96000000000004s)]
*  But then again, the Republicans are going to come after him. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=513.12s)]
*  The part that bothers me, though, is this question was asked multiple times to the president, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=515.16s)]
*  to the White House press secretary, and they got so nasty. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=520.84s)]
*  What our correspondents, when they asked, don't ask us this question, don't do it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=524.9200000000001s)]
*  Here's just a little bit of when the question was asked to the White House press secretary, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=528.2s)]
*  who's not going to be doing any press conferences because the president is going to Africa. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  This is what she said before, though. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=536.8s)]
*  Watch. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=538.08s)]
*  Any possibility that the president would end up pardoning his son? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=539.08s)]
*  No. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=543.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, is there a- [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  I just said no. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=545.3199999999999s)]
*  I just answered. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=546.3199999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=547.3199999999999s)]
*  Will you accept the jury's outcome, their verdict, no matter what it is? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=548.3199999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=552.08s)]
*  And have you ruled out a pardon for your son? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=553.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm extremely proud of my son, Hunter. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=556.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to do anything. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=558.6s)]
*  I said I abide by the jury decision. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=560.4s)]
*  I will do that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=562.64s)]
*  I will not pardon. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=563.64s)]
*  Does the president have any intention of pardoning him? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=565.04s)]
*  We've been asked that question multiple times. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=568.96s)]
*  Our answer stands, which is no. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=570.72s)]
*  President Biden says that he's not going to pardon his son, Hunter. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=573.3199999999999s)]
*  Is he going to ask Donald Trump to do that? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=577.12s)]
*  I don't have anything else to share about that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=579.56s)]
*  I'm not going to go down a rabbit hole on this. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  I've been very clear, the president's been very clear when we've been asked this question. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=583.56s)]
*  They are such liars, all of them. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=586.76s)]
*  The thing is- [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=590.04s)]
*  Now reveal. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=591.04s)]
*  You can even back it up even further. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=592.04s)]
*  Not only did he have his father and his name blocking for him, he initially started blocking [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=593.36s)]
*  for the FBI. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=597.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=598.48s)]
*  When that laptop would have blew up Hunter, his legal cases, international business dealings, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=599.48s)]
*  his personal transgressions, his horrible pictures with hookers, and the love child [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=602.64s)]
*  that he denied having, still not paying child support for a period of time, had to fight, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=607.04s)]
*  had to be sued in order to pay it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=612.6s)]
*  All these things are going on, and the FBI was blocking, holding it, which led to- is [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=614.2s)]
*  going to lead to our story later on the need for a new FBI director. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uhH1RI41hk&t=617.96s)]
