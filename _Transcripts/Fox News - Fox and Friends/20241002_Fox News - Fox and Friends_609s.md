# Speaker Johnson: This was just shameless
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U)
*  Look who's with us here on the curvy couch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=0.0s)]
*  It is the speaker of the House of Representatives, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=2.56s)]
*  Mike Johnson from the great state of Louisiana. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=5.08s)]
*  He never gets out, Steve. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=7.08s)]
*  So he's always just hanging out in the office. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=8.32s)]
*  How on the road have you been? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=11.08s)]
*  I know you were at the stock market, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=13.52s)]
*  stock exchange yesterday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=14.96s)]
*  Yeah, I did a big speech there on economic policy [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=15.96s)]
*  and our big plans for the future. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=18.2s)]
*  And we've been traveling nonstop, you guys, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=19.44s)]
*  as of this last weekend. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  I've done campaign events in 220-something cities [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  in 39 states. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  And we're going to do 65 cities in 25 states [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=26.6s)]
*  this month alone. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  Who works harder, you or Brian? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=30.4s)]
*  Brian. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=32.0s)]
*  He never sleeps. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=33.0s)]
*  Are you doing that, Mr. Speaker, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=34.0s)]
*  because Donald Trump says no tax on overtime? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=35.48s)]
*  Clearly you're working overtime. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=38.4s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=39.64s)]
*  Well, he and I both are traveling nonstop. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  In fact, it's very inspiring. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=42.6s)]
*  I sat down with him last week sometime. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=43.68s)]
*  We were in the same place at the same time. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  And he said, my schedule's full. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=47.8s)]
*  I told the team, fill it every hour of every day [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  all the way through the election. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=52.16s)]
*  He said, Mike, we can't leave anything on the field, right? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=53.08s)]
*  We would have regret if we had done one more city, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  one more event. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=58.04s)]
*  For him to have that kind of stamina [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=59.6s)]
*  is really inspiring to all of us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=61.2s)]
*  Well, the big event yesterday [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=62.44s)]
*  was the vice presidential debate. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=63.84s)]
*  And we were talking in the green room a moment ago [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=66.16s)]
*  just about the moderators and the job CBS did. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=69.84s)]
*  Watch this clip, if you missed last night, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=73.68s)]
*  where they said they weren't going to fact check, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=76.32s)]
*  but then they fact checked. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=79.4s)]
*  Thank you, Governor. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=82.08s)]
*  And just to clarify for our viewers, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=82.92s)]
*  Springfield, Ohio does have a large number [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=85.08s)]
*  of Haitian migrants who have legal status, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=87.84s)]
*  temporary protected status. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=91.44s)]
*  Dora? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=93.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=94.36s)]
*  Senator, we have so much to get to. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=95.2s)]
*  Margaret, I think it's important because- [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=96.16s)]
*  We're gonna turn out of the economy, thank you. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  Margaret, the rules were that you guys [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  weren't gonna fact check. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  And since you're fact checking me, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  I think it's important to say what's actually going on. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=103.64s)]
*  So there's an application called the CBP One App, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=106.32s)]
*  where you can go on as an illegal migrant, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=109.28s)]
*  apply for asylum or apply for parole, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=111.44s)]
*  and be granted legal status at the wave [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  of a Kamala Harris open border wand. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=117.84s)]
*  That is not a person coming in, applying for a green card, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=120.84s)]
*  and waiting for 10 years. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=123.56s)]
*  That is the facilitation of illegal immigration, Margaret, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=124.88s)]
*  by our own leadership. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=128.04s)]
*  Thank you, Senator, for describing the legal process. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=128.88s)]
*  We have so much to get to, Senator. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=131.72s)]
*  Those laws have been on the books since 1990. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=134.2s)]
*  Thank you, gentlemen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  The CBP One App has not been on the books since 1990. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=138.04s)]
*  It's something that Kamala Harris created, Margaret. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=141.6s)]
*  Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  because your mics are cut. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  We have so much we wanna get to. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  Thank you for explaining the legal process. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=149.48s)]
*  We're not gonna cut your mic. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=152.48s)]
*  What a condescending comment at the end. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=153.76s)]
*  Right, at the end. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=155.04s)]
*  It's just shameless. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=156.56s)]
*  Thank you for explaining the laws to us. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  Their bias, their disdain for any Republican candidate [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=159.27999999999997s)]
*  is just on open display. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  Everybody can see that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=163.48s)]
*  I mean, it was three against one. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=164.44s)]
*  But JD's still got it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=166.0s)]
*  I wanted to hear his answer, though. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=166.83999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=168.27999999999997s)]
*  But the issue does bother me. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=169.11999999999998s)]
*  It's very important. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  You give special status to Haitians, Cubans, Venezuelans [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  because their country's going to hell. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=175.04s)]
*  We can't, doesn't mean we have to absorb everybody. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=177.12s)]
*  Should we not have a say in this? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=179.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=181.44s)]
*  The immigration policy is basically nonexistent. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=182.28s)]
*  They opened the border. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=185.0s)]
*  They're allowing everyone in. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=185.84s)]
*  They put out the welcome mat. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=186.76s)]
*  And the catastrophe that this has been to our country [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=187.84s)]
*  and every metric of public policy [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=190.28s)]
*  with the fentanyl poisonings [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=192.0s)]
*  of being the leading cause of death [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=194.4s)]
*  from Americans age 18 to 49, the trafficking, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=195.76s)]
*  the fact that JD pointed out so well, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=197.88s)]
*  they have lost all of these children [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=199.84s)]
*  who came across the border. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=202.0s)]
*  Over 10,000. Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=202.84s)]
*  I mean, if a Republican administration had done that, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=204.12s)]
*  it's all you would see every day. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=207.56s)]
*  But they try to bury it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=209.12s)]
*  JD was so good last night [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=210.56s)]
*  because he brought answers, solutions. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  He talked about policies. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=214.6s)]
*  He showed us his depth. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=215.88s)]
*  And he came across as just being very reasonable and likable. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=218.0s)]
*  I just thought he was at his best. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=220.88s)]
*  He did a great job. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=222.24s)]
*  What do you think about this port strike? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=223.08s)]
*  We've been talking about this since day two now. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=224.44s)]
*  It's going to affect all families across the country [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=226.24s)]
*  if we don't resolve this soon. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=228.84s)]
*  What should Biden and Kamala Harris be doing to resolve it? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=230.36s)]
*  Well, they need to ensure that these parties stay at the table [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  negotiating good faith and get to the end of this thing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=236.24s)]
*  They have had this sort of hands-off approach [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=239.12s)]
*  and that weakness is going to exacerbate the problem. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=242.04s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump's pointed out [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=244.96s)]
*  in the last couple of days, this is a direct result, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  one more direct result of binomics, of the inflation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, these dock workers, port workers [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=252.28s)]

*  have failed in every measure. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=272.56s)]
*  And everybody can see that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=274.64000000000004s)]
*  This election is about a contrast, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=275.72s)]
*  that the answers, the solutions, the ideas that JD put forward. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=277.64000000000004s)]
*  And the fact that Walz could not stand there and answer [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  this simple question, if Kamala Harris has [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=283.92s)]

*  why hasn't she done it for the last four years? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=288.2s)]
*  They cannot answer that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=290.08s)]
*  Well, and Joe Biden, we've heard him a million times. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=291.24s)]
*  He's the world's most pro-union president [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=293.56s)]
*  in the history of the republic. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=296.88s)]
*  He wanted big labor to have a lot of power. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=298.68s)]
*  They've got a lot of power now. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=300.68s)]
*  Unfortunately for his vice president, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=302.28s)]
*  our vice president, Kamala Harris, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=305.64s)]
*  this comes at a politically precarious time. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=307.12s)]
*  The longer this goes, the worse for her [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=310.4s)]
*  when stuff starts costing more or drying up. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  Yes, and the latest numbers are very encouraging for our side [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=316.48s)]
*  because the Democratic Party and Kamala Harris [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=319.52s)]
*  have the lowest level of support from union workers [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=321.68s)]
*  in the history of polling. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=324.68s)]
*  In 2020, Joe Biden was up by 19 points among union members. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=326.24s)]
*  She's up by nine. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=330.52s)]
*  And it's a perilous position she's in. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=332.08s)]
*  So we'll see how this resolves. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=333.84s)]
*  But it's doing real damage to the economy, to people. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=335.56s)]
*  It's going to make costs go up for all these hardworking [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=338.32s)]
*  families who are already struggling. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=340.52s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, do you think you should be doing something [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=341.52s)]
*  to get these men and women back to work? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=343.36s)]

*  Well, it is. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=347.88s)]
*  And the Tapped Hartley Act is part of the law. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  The president has the ability to evoke that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  Congress doesn't have much say in these things. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=354.35999999999996s)]
*  But we're going to continue to hammer the point [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  that they've got to get back to work. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=358.0s)]

*  We're still reeling on the heels of Hurricane Helene [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=361.67999999999995s)]

*  Israel is under fire by Iran. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=366.08s)]

*  And this is emblematic of the Biden-Harris administration [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=370.0s)]
*  and what they've done to the country. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=373.67999999999995s)]
*  We're approaching the one-year anniversary of what happened [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=375.04s)]
*  on October 7th in Israel. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=377.64000000000004s)]
*  Israel's vowing revenge, and they're fighting back. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  They took out the leader of Hezbollah, the leader of Hamas. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  They took out five other leaders of Hamas. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=384.56s)]
*  They used the pagers. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=387.44s)]
*  They blew up all the pagers. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=388.88s)]
*  And those were a lot of the terrorists [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=390.16s)]
*  that were killed as well. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=391.92s)]
*  So they are fighting back. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=393.36s)]
*  But yesterday, there were 200 missiles [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=394.56s)]
*  that were launched into Israel. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=396.32000000000005s)]
*  There was that attack at the subway. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=397.68s)]
*  From Iran. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=399.32000000000005s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=400.20000000000005s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=401.16s)]
*  Yeah, what's your reaction to this? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=401.68s)]
*  And what can we do as America? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=402.8s)]
*  Well, again, let me just point back to the president [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=404.16s)]
*  and the vice president. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=406.8s)]
*  They have put us in this situation. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=407.76000000000005s)]
*  They've tried to appease Iran with their policies. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=409.16s)]
*  They've empowered them. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=411.36s)]
*  They've not enforced the sanctions. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=412.68s)]
*  And that's what allowed Iran to have the resources to do [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=414.36s)]
*  what they're doing right now. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=417.48s)]
*  It's a very dangerous situation. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=418.64000000000004s)]
*  We have to stand unequivocally with Israel right now. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=420.0s)]
*  The Biden administration has tried to play both sides. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  They tried to appease Iran, and that's [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=425.36s)]
*  what's gotten us into this dangerous situation. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=426.88s)]
*  We're on the verge of World War III. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=428.92s)]
*  That's true. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=431.48s)]

*  and it's because of the failed policies. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=434.88000000000005s)]
*  We have got to project peace through strength. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=436.44s)]
*  I think JD hammered that point so well last night. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=438.56s)]

*  Well, let's just think about this. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=445.96000000000004s)]
*  Nobody wants World War III, but did you [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=446.88000000000005s)]
*  notice the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=448.44000000000005s)]

*  knows Iran's the problem. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=454.84000000000003s)]
*  Of course. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=455.84000000000003s)]

*  so we know hurricanes and disaster recovery really well. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=542.92s)]
*  Congress did appropriate $20 billion additional dollars [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=546.12s)]
*  to FEMA in the last few years. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=548.64s)]
*  That's not going to be enough. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=550.24s)]
*  No, it's not, of course. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=551.0s)]
*  But it takes a while to assess the damage. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=552.0s)]
*  This is a big one. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=553.58s)]
*  It's the most- [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=554.36s)]
*  It says $35 billion right now. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=554.88s)]
*  Yeah, it'll be much higher than that, of course. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=556.36s)]
*  I mean, look at the swath and the breadth of the damage [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=558.32s)]
*  across so many states. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=561.0s)]
*  But it'll take a while. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=562.08s)]
*  It'll take 30 days or more for them to assess that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=563.12s)]
*  But Congress will have to address it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=566.0s)]
*  I mean, this is an appropriate role [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=567.6s)]
*  for the federal government. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=568.74s)]
*  But to your point, Steve, we have [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=569.72s)]
*  to prioritize federal spending. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=571.16s)]
*  We have a $35 trillion federal debt. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=572.8s)]
*  You've got to take care of national defense. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=574.96s)]
*  You have to handle federal emergencies. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=576.36s)]
*  These are appropriate roles for the federal government. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=578.1600000000001s)]
*  We ought to be doing it in a bipartisan fashion. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=580.2800000000001s)]
*  And I certainly hope that we can get that done. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=582.2s)]
*  It would be great if the president was at his beach [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=584.2s)]
*  house during this time. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  That would be great. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  If we had any leadership at all from Biden and Harris, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  we don't. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  And I think the American people see that. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=590.2800000000001s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for dropping by the couch. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB_IMUwmj8U&t=591.8000000000001s)]
