# Operation Midnight Hammer: B-2 bombers go from Missouri to Iran
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI)
*  All right, we are live right now at Whiteman Air Force Base, just about 90 minutes to the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=0.0s)]
*  south and to the east of Kansas City. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=5.68s)]
*  And the reason I am here this morning is because the whole world is talking about Operation [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=7.76s)]
*  Midnight Hammer. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  When seven stealth bombers, and I am looking at the entire arsenal of stealth bombers, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=15.88s)]
*  they're just over there in the restricted area here at Whiteman, when they took off from [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=22.2s)]
*  Whiteman, flew to Iran, dropped their payloads and came back home. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=26.48s)]
*  This area is so filled with pride for what the men and women of the 509 do, and nobody [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=32.28s)]
*  is more proud than Congressman Mark Alford. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=38.36s)]
*  He represents this congressional district. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=41.68s)]
*  He's a Republican, and it's great to be here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  And as I said, everybody's so proud of what happens here. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=46.56s)]
*  Steve, I'm extremely proud of the men and women here, not just the pilots, but the maintainers, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=50.96s)]
*  the men and women who refueled these jets. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=56.44s)]
*  Imagine being in a jet for 36 hours to go over to strike Iran, come back. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  It was all done with precision under the direction of President Donald J. Trump, and I'm extremely [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=64.24s)]
*  excited that we have decapitated the nuclear capabilities of Iran. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=68.64s)]
*  And this is the Air Force, the control tower, where they do all the controlling. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=73.68s)]
*  It's pretty cool to have the entire world collection of B-2s right here. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=79.36s)]
*  You were telling me a story. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=84.72s)]
*  Back in the day, you heard Ronald Reagan talk about some magic airplane. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=86.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  I used to be a television reporter and anchor. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  My first job in Waco, Texas, Ronald Reagan came there in 1988 and talked about this plane [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=93.68s)]
*  that we were building that no one could see. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  I thought, what in the crazy thing are you talking about? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  And here I am, the fourth congressional district representative who gets to represent this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=102.92s)]
*  great base, not just the B-2, but also the programs out here, the A-10 that we're losing [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=107.64s)]
*  actually, that platform we're trying to find a replacement mission, the MQ-9 Reaper, Blackhawk [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=113.12s)]
*  helicopters. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=119.44s)]
*  This base is a jewel of the Department of Defense, and I get to represent it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=120.6s)]
*  I'm very honored. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=124.92s)]
*  And this particular airplane is so specific. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=126.32s)]
*  The way they used it, they had two 15-ton bombs in it, and they flew it the entire way [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  over, pushed the button, dropped the bombs, and came back home. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=137.28s)]
*  What they do is, it's almost superhuman, but they figured out how to do it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=141.28s)]
*  And they practice these drills all the time. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  And the B-2 was built to carry nuclear weapons as well as conventional. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  This of course was a conventional weapon. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=153.24s)]
*  The nuclear weapon that they carry is actually built not too far from here in South Kansas [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=155.28s)]
*  City, the non-nuclear components. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  It's married together with the nuclear components and then brought back here to put on the B-2. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  We are getting a new platform, and that's what I'm excited about. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=166.68s)]
*  Until that happens, we are making sure that we have the funding to keep the B-2 lethal, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=170.44s)]
*  capable, and ready. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=175.24s)]
*  But we're getting the B-21 Raider that's being made in Palmdale, California. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=176.6s)]
*  You know, originally the B-2, we were supposed to build 132 of them. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=180.8s)]
*  Because of the end of the Cold War, we only ended up building 21. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=184.6s)]
*  Can you imagine what this world would be like if we had 100 of these stationed around the world? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=187.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=193.0s)]
*  And you know, the 509 Bomb Wing, which is what we're talking about right here, based [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=194.0s)]
*  here at Whiteman. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  So historic, because these are the guys who dropped the original bomb on Hiroshima from [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=200.48s)]
*  the Enola Gay. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=207.16s)]
*  They've got a facsimile as you drive into the base this morning. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  They know what they're doing, and they've been doing it for decades. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  They moved operations here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=215.26s)]
*  And talk a little bit about how the area embraces what goes on here. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=217.76s)]
*  We are all invested in what they do here at Whiteman. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  And I'm honored to represent actually two Department of Defense bases down in Pulaski [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=226.76s)]
*  County not too far from us. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=231.2s)]
*  It's Fort Leonard Wood. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=232.56s)]
*  We train more than 80,000 personnel. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=233.6s)]
*  We're getting five new companies there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  But this Whiteman Air Force base is really a jewel. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=237.84s)]
*  I talked about the B-21 platform. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=243.04s)]
*  We are getting the second wave of those. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=245.76s)]
*  We're going to build 100 initially. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  And we will get the second wave of those. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=251.68s)]
*  Aerosworth Air Force base gets the fourth wave, we the second, and then down at Dias [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=253.36s)]
*  in Texas. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=257.16s)]
*  But this will be the center of excellence for that program under the leadership of Colonel [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=258.16s)]
*  Whitler, who just took over a couple of days ago. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=262.52000000000004s)]
*  Colonel Keith Butler retired and went on to do some other things. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=265.88s)]
*  But I'm excited to be a part of this and help fund the security that we need to keep bad [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  actors like Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin at bay, and of course the mullahs. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=275.68s)]
*  Ultimately, Congressman, when the going gets tough, the president goes to Whiteman. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=280.24s)]
*  And that's why he came here, because he ordered a couple of days ago Operation Midnight Hammer. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=285.08s)]
*  It was hammer time. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  It was hammer time. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=291.8s)]
*  And God bless America. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=293.12s)]
*  God bless Donald J. Trump for trying to negotiate originally. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=294.8s)]
*  The mullahs wouldn't have it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=299.32s)]
*  And he showed them what we're made of. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=300.62s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=302.36s)]
*  Congressman, thank you very much. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=303.36s)]
*  So Lawrence, it is all happening here at Whiteman Air Force base. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  And we are so lucky to be on the base today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=308.8s)]
*  And they really rolled out the red carpet for us today. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=310.68s)]
*  Super proud to be American today. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  Thanks, Steve. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=315.08s)]
*  We'll check in with you later. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrM3KVTThI&t=316.08s)]
