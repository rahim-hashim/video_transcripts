# 'SEE YOU AT THE LIBRARY': Kirk Cameron and BRAVE Books bring wholesome stories to kids
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A)
*  All right a special day at libraries all across the country yesterday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=0.0s)]
*  It was the second National CU at the library day with [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=4.34s)]
*  360 story hours held in 45 states and families gathering to read wholesome children's books singing the national anthem [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=31.74s)]
*  God bless America and pray the man behind this movement actor writer producer and author Kirk Cameron joins us now Kirk [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=39.98s)]
*  Thanks for being here. What an awesome thing to see over over 30,000 at least people attended these across the country [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=47.54s)]
*  But remind our viewers real quick Kirk how this came about this CU at the library day [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=53.16s)]
*  Well Pete Rachel so great to be with you guys this morning this came about a couple years ago [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=58.779999999999994s)]
*  We started reading books in public libraries and were being banned because the library said they didn't line up with the values of love and kindness and and peace [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  And we ended up being greeted by thousands and thousands of families who want to get back to these values [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=72.06s)]
*  And that culminated into this National CU at the library day and this year we we were even larger than last year with 360 libraries [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=78.3s)]
*  All 50 states organized by others not me not brave books but moms and dads and I went to three of them yesterday and we were overwhelmed with with people who just love God love their family and love this country [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=87.26s)]
*  So this has become an organic thing you you people anyone can get involved in their local community [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=101.78s)]
*  Is there a certain set of books? How do you choose what is shared with the kids? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=106.58s)]
*  Well you can choose whatever books you want to share with the kids they can be books that you've written books that I've written brave books or any book [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=112.05999999999999s)]
*  And that's what's so beautiful about it is that these are families that showed up and they have their kids waving all of these American flags not rainbow flags [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=119.5s)]
*  I'm so thankful that the values that they're celebrating are the values that made this such a great country like faith and morality and education law and liberty [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=129.5s)]
*  You know back in June there was a world record set for the world's largest drag queen story hour and Guinness recorded it with 260 people [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=139.82000000000002s)]
*  We had 30,000 people over 350 story hours and they were waving American flags and that just makes me feel so good [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=148.06s)]
*  Guinness didn't show up but we had the world's largest story hour yesterday CU at the library [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=159.18s)]
*  Interesting maybe next any resistance from some of these you still get resistance from libraries Kirk? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=165.02s)]
*  Yeah you know it's it's usually not the libraries or the people who visit the libraries but some of the leadership [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=170.3s)]
*  Some of them dubbed this event Kirkpocalypse heaven forbid we come and talk to children about compassion self-control and faith [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=176.62s)]
*  Man I know you wear that as a badge of honor Kirkpocalypse certainly not what if reading if praying [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=186.06s)]
*  We're singing the national anthem reading a wholesome book is the sign of the apocalypse and that's really where we're at [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=193.1s)]
*  Kirk that's right and if you [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=198.38s)]
*  If you want to join and support this tsunami wave of goodness sweeping across the nation [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=201.42s)]
*  Go to brave books.com. We've got lots more coming. This isn't see you next year p [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=207.66s)]
*  We've got a children's tv show coming in the fall more great books and all kinds of things [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=212.7s)]
*  So, of course, i'm sure you'll blow blow your record of this year out next year as well [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=217.1s)]
*  So folks you think about that, but there's a lot more at brave books.us as well. That's worth checking out kirk cameron [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKZxwYv-6A&t=220.3s)]
