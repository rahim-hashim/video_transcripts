# Trump pushes to buy Greenland: 'Absolute necessity' for national security
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE)
*  I was amazed this when the president speaking a lot when he was on the campaign trail [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=0.0s)]
*  What do you do and it drives people crazy, but they just say new audience [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=4.44s)]
*  I got to give the same message every single time and sometimes you carry the message and you go wow [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=8.52s)]
*  It's the same speech since the president won [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  He's putting new things into all his remarks whether it's the Patriot Awards [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=16.0s)]
*  Or we saw yesterday and shot with in front of Charlie Kirk's group [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think part of it is like when you're running for office [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=23.68s)]
*  You want to be very consistent and tell people this is what I'm gonna do now. He's won [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=27.2s)]
*  It's not like he's making some giant crazy turn here [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  He's just trying to maybe put some meat on the bones of what the agenda is gonna be now that he's got the power soon [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=34.56s)]
*  Of governance, let's watch a little bit from what he said yesterday watch this [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=40.72s)]
*  So we get the highest vote ever for a Republican [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=45.68s)]
*  Candidate we won by 36 points with young people that never happens a Republican loses by [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  36 or 40 so I'm gonna have to start thinking about tick-tock [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=56.38s)]
*  We did go on tick-tock and we had a great response with billions of views billions and billions of views [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=60.38s)]
*  they brought me a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=67.7s)]
*  They brought me a chart and it was a record and it was so beautiful to see and as I looked at it [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=69.42s)]
*  I said, maybe we got to keep this sucker around a little while [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=76.06s)]
*  You know [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=79.7s)]
*  When my first day back in the Oval Office, I will sign a historic slate of executive orders to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=80.9s)]
*  Close our border to illegal aliens and stop the invasion of our country [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=87.06s)]
*  And on that same day [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  We will begin the largest deportation operation in American history and we will create the new Department of Government [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=95.54s)]
*  Efficiency headed by Elon Musk [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=103.54s)]
*  And no, he's not taking the presidency I [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=106.54s)]
*  Like having smart people, you know the they're on a new kick Russia Russia Russia Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=111.66000000000001s)]
*  all the different hoaxes and the new one is [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=117.9s)]
*  President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon Musk [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=121.94000000000001s)]
*  No, no [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=126.58000000000001s)]
*  That's not happening [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=129.06s)]
*  But [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=131.06s)]
*  Elon's done an amazing job [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=133.58s)]
*  Isn't it nice to have smart people that we could rely on but no, he's not gonna be president that I can tell you [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=135.62s)]
*  And I'm safe, you know why he can't be he wasn't born in this country ha ha ha [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=145.86s)]
*  Has anyone ever heard of the Panama Canal? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=151.7s)]
*  Huh [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=154.3s)]
*  Because we're being ripped off at the Panama Canal like we're being ripped off everywhere else when president [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=155.86s)]
*  Jimmy Carter foolishly gave it away gave it away for one dollar one dollar [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=161.94s)]
*  During his term in office [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  It was solely for Panama to manage and not for China or any other country to manage [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=169.98s)]
*  It was given to Panama and to the people of Panama, but it has provisions [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=176.3s)]
*  You got to treat us fairly and they haven't treated us fairly if the principles both moral and legal of this [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=182.34s)]
*  Magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  in full [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=199.06s)]
*  Quickly and without question [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=201.5s)]
*  So those are some of the things I was talking about so he's talking about I am dome for the country [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=204.62s)]
*  I want Greenland from Denmark and by the way, I want the Panama Canal [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=209.34s)]
*  So I asked the brain room about the Panama Canal [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=213.38s)]
*  They say there's no proof that are that China owns any portion of it [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=215.18s)]
*  We use 70 72 percent of all traffic is American and the prices did go up 15% [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=218.74s)]
*  Nearly five billion dollars over the last year [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=224.9s)]
*  But they say it's because of low low water levels and they have to slow down the amount of traffic that goes through [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=227.54s)]
*  But you know what's rattle their cage make them justify it [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=233.54s)]
*  Yeah, but let's see if they would get this prices down after all we are a frequent customer [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=236.94s)]
*  I do think part of this though is national security you think of Greenland for example [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=241.18s)]
*  The Arctic is a major I think battle area for the future in terms of who controls the Arctic and I think the same applies [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=245.42s)]
*  To the Panama Canal China may not control it [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  But they my understanding is have some very strategic interests in that area [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=255.7s)]
*  So part of this I think is Trump starting a negotiation with you want the whole thing back and then the Panamanians might say well [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=259.38s)]
*  Hang on no, but let's have this conversation [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=265.62s)]
*  Trump just announced yesterday his ambassador Denmark which owns Greenland [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=268.82s)]
*  Can you imagine having that job now or being the ambassador Panama you're gonna have a busy opening few weeks here [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=272.88s)]
*  I think it's one of the PayPal Mafia. It's Ken Howry [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=279.09999999999997s)]
*  Ambassador Denmark, so I think he's probably good [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=282.29999999999995s)]
*  With this exact thing in mind because he posted on true social for purposes of national security and freedom through the world the United States [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=286.29999999999995s)]
*  Of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=293.3s)]
*  this is something that he brought up during his first term in office and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  Denmark which I mean Greenland is a sovereign nation, but under the Kingdom of Denmark's [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=301.66s)]
*  Authority, I guess sovereignty. Yeah, they're within that kind of a nation. Yes anyway [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump was mocked for saying it but he clearly has a plan for why he wants to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=314.1s)]
*  Control Greenland or take it under the United States umbrella and one of the things I was just pure speculation here [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=320.64s)]
*  It's he is talking a lot about how to get criminal illegal immigrants out of our country and if countries like Venezuela that we don't have [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=326.64s)]
*  Relations with won't take them back [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=334.96s)]
*  Maybe he'll maybe build a facility in Greenland and ship them there that would for sure be a deterrent for people to come to the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=336.36s)]
*  Country if they know that they're going to Greenland very cold. Yeah, yeah put it this way [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=342.4s)]
*  I think we got my prediction we get it [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=346.4s)]
*  Like get it get it. I think we get Greenland my prediction what's that? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=348.84s)]
*  You would say to December 23rd. Yeah, December 23rd [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  2024 I believe by the end of his term will get Greenland because he loves real estate and mark it down right and we'll see [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=356.32s)]
*  And I'll tell you what I'm wondering what Denmark needs from us. I wonder what Greenland has to say about this [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=362.24s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know what how they would feel about it [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=367.9s)]
*  Do you have a government a couple fun facts about Greenland? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=369.84s)]
*  Do you know the population of it [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=372.96s)]
*  56,699 people and that's because 75% of it is covered in a sheet of ice and the capital city is nuke [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  Really? Yeah, I would never have picked nuke [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=384.2s)]
*  And you you can right that's right. So Iceland's nicer than Greenland and the Vikings are responsible [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=387.12s)]
*  Iceland is greener than Greenland [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=394.32s)]
*  And Greenland is icier than Iceland the way I learned it and a lot of a lot of times things don't come out correct [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=396.52s)]
*  But I remember people told me oh that the Vikings looking to throw off visitors would name Iceland Iceland snow [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  Where would come it's nice and they named Greenland [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=409.12s)]
*  I think that's probably true because can you find out can you ask Fran Tarkington of the Vikings or somebody? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=411.4s)]
*  Yep, the brain room. Brain room. Where's Leif Erikson? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=417.08s)]
*  I know. Or at least yeah. I would say. I bet you there's truth to that [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=419.64s)]
*  I remember learning that in school. Right those are the type of things that you expect on a news network [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=424.8s)]
*  I bet you there's some truth to that. I probably definitely try to back [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=429.24s)]
*  I don't know why Trump wants Greenland could be totally off [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=433.56s)]
*  As soon as you start saying like this might not come out, right? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=436.36s)]
*  But I'm just like holding on to the couch what's gonna happen? I should save that for radio. I'm Steve Ducey [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fihu8Brz0bE&t=439.68s)]
