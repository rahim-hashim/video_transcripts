# Hillary Clinton makes heinous claim about Trump's Madison Square Garden rally
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0)
*  Hillary Clinton was on another network yesterday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=0.0s)]
*  and she was talking about linking him to this rally. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=3.4s)]
*  He's gonna have a rally at MSG. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=5.74s)]
*  A lot of people sing, a lot of people perform at MSG. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=7.34s)]
*  Do you link everyone who's ever performed at MSG [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=10.82s)]
*  to this neo-Nazi rally back in 1939? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  She's saying that's what this is, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=17.06s)]
*  that Donald Trump is going to MSG [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=18.66s)]
*  and she says to Caitlin, she says, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=20.14s)]
*  and I write about it in my book. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=22.26s)]
*  She's trying to sell her book. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=24.26s)]
*  So there are two messages that she's giving. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=25.7s)]
*  Buy my book and he's a fascist. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=28.84s)]
*  And then there's this article in the Washington Examiner. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  It's called Reductio ad Hitlerum, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=34.92s)]
*  60 years of Democrats falsely calling [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=38.76s)]
*  the Republican nominee a fascist. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=41.04s)]
*  And I looked up Reductio ad Hitlerum [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=42.72s)]
*  and it's known as playing the Nazi card. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  It's in Latin. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, there you go. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=48.24s)]
*  And they go through all the lists of every Republican [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=49.06s)]
*  who's ever run for president. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=51.72s)]
*  60 years. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=53.04s)]
*  And this goes back 60 years, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=53.88s)]
*  starting with Barry Goldwater after in 1964, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=55.5s)]
*  he was the Republican nominee. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=59.459999999999994s)]
*  The Democratic governor of California said [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=60.81999999999999s)]
*  his acceptance speech at the RNC had the stench of fascism. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=62.739999999999995s)]
*  However, he was the one who was a pilot [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=68.53999999999999s)]
*  in the military in World War II [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=70.72s)]
*  and the Democratic governor of California [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=72.06s)]
*  had no military experience. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=73.5s)]
*  MLK Jr. said, we see dangerous signs of Hitlerism [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=75.02s)]
*  in the Goldwater campaign. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=78.02s)]
*  And Jackie Robinson said, I would say that I now believe [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=79.14s)]
*  I know how it felt to be a Jew in Hitler's Germany. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=82.3s)]
*  A couple of things too. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=85.64s)]
*  Barry Goldwater not paying attention. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  She should be looking straight ahead in those pictures. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=89.32s)]
*  We were sitting there taking pictures. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=91.88s)]
*  It goes on through Nixon. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=92.72s)]
*  It goes on through Ronald Reagan. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  Hubert Humphrey said, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=95.6s)]
*  this is kind of, if the British had not fought 1940, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=96.92s)]
*  Hitler would have been in London. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  And if Democrats do not fight 1968, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=101.24s)]
*  Nixon will be in the White House. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=103.96s)]
*  Okay, it's the same thing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=105.36s)]
*  And then Nixon won. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=106.56s)]
*  Right, yep. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  Here's Hillary. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=108.44s)]
*  One other thing that you'll see next week, Caitlin, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=110.84s)]
*  is Trump actually reenacting [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=113.92s)]
*  the Madison Square Garden rally in 1939. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=119.22s)]
*  I write about this in my book. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=124.26s)]
*  President Franklin Roosevelt was appalled [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=126.62s)]
*  that neo-Nazis, fascists in America, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=129.54s)]
*  were lining up to essentially pledge their support [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=133.62s)]
*  for the kind of government [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=138.82s)]
*  that they were seeing in Germany. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=140.34s)]
*  So I don't think we can ignore it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=143.24s)]
*  Now, it may be a leap for some people, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=145.56s)]
*  and a lot of others may think, I don't wanna go there. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=148.12s)]
*  I don't wanna say that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=151.1s)]
*  But please, open your eyes to the danger [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=152.74s)]
*  that this man poses to our country, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=156.04s)]
*  because I think it is clear and present [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=159.52s)]
*  for anybody paying attention. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=161.96s)]
*  I mean, this is- [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=163.64s)]
*  Amazing how she does not interrupt her, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=164.48s)]
*  like she did President Trump on the town hall. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  She only called him a Nazi. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=169.92s)]
*  Why interrupt? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=171.28s)]
*  There was no pushback on this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=172.12s)]
*  Can we just talk about the fact that MSG is in New York, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=173.78s)]
*  and Hillary Clinton used to represent [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=176.82s)]
*  the state of New York? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=179.54s)]
*  Does she have any interest of understanding [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=181.14000000000001s)]
*  why voters in New York, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=183.9s)]
*  which is typically a Democrat stronghold, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=185.82s)]
*  a lot of them are voting for Donald Trump. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=189.1s)]
*  Is Donald Trump gonna win New York? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=190.86s)]
*  Obviously not. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=192.02s)]
*  But we've never seen a Republican in modern day time [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=193.12s)]
*  come within five, six points in the state of New York. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=196.78s)]
*  And it's because they've bust all these migrants in here, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=201.0s)]
*  and they're feeling the pain on a day-to-day basis. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=204.28s)]
*  I just used the Google machine, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=206.92s)]
*  and I looked up because I was curious [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=208.84s)]
*  what that particular event in the 1939s looked like. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=210.89999999999998s)]
*  And apparently there was a German-American Bund [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=215.12s)]
*  held a rally at Madison Square Garden, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=217.88s)]
*  20,000 attendees, Nazi armbands, American flags, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=219.88s)]
*  and storm troopers in the aisle. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, there's video. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=225.73999999999998s)]
*  I wonder if it's gonna look like that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=227.6s)]
*  We were not in the World War yet. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=229.74s)]
*  We were not in World War II yet at that point. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=230.94s)]
*  Whatever you do, do not buy her book. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=234.78s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=236.38s)]
*  She keeps writing memoirs. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=237.58s)]
*  No one cares about her life in real time, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=238.62s)]
*  let alone for her reflections on it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  And if you did buy the book, please return it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=242.42000000000002s)]
*  Can you return a book after you read it? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=245.02s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=246.66000000000003s)]
*  You can? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=247.5s)]
*  It's damaged. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  The library is free. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=249.16000000000003s)]
*  Well, what you do is you turn it and go, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=251.02s)]
*  I'm sorry, this made no sense. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=252.38s)]
*  And I like it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=253.78s)]
*  Like an infomercial. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  We'll give you your money back. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=258.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I'm all done. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=260.08s)]
*  Everyone's dumber having read it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsmQQFDvq0&t=261.03999999999996s)]
