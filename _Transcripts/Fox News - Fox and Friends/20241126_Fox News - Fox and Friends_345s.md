# 'IT'S NOT OK': Teen runner delivers impassioned message to school officials
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw)
*  California teenagers speaking out after her cross country team says they were forced to remove these save girls sports shirts and their concerns over a transgender teammate were ignored. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=0.0s)]
*  I have been around the females and just my team in general who have felt almost silenced to speak out about it because the whole LGBTQ is shoved down our throats and going into a locker room and seeing males in there. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=16.48s)]
*  I don't find that safe. It's not OK. I'm a 16 year old girl. There's girls around me where we do not feel safe having boys in our environment. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  That is Riley Morrow and she joins us right now live screen left with her attorney Julie Ann Fisher. Ladies good morning to you. Thanks for joining us from California. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=43.68s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=53.44s)]
*  Good morning. Riley. Let's start with you. You were speaking out at your school board meeting because there is a transgender student a biologically born boy on your cross country team and you you just don't feel safe. Do you? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=55.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  Explain that is correct. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=75.4s)]
*  I'm having a male on our team proposes genetic advantages for that student but I'm not trying to use this platform to just advocate for my team. I'm choosing to advocate for girls and women across the globe. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=77.72000000000001s)]
*  And in particular this biological boy shares your locker room with you and you don't feel safe or comfortable in that situation right. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=92.92000000000002s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=103.64s)]
*  And so Julie Ann there a lawsuit has been brought up. She is not part of it. You are. What are you doing to try to fix this situation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  Certainly. So two of my clients that are Riley's teammates on the cross country team out in Riverside Unified School District. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=118.12s)]
*  Two of the girls have brought this lawsuit against their school district based on two causes of action. One is a Title IX issue which resulted from a Taylor who is a junior [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  at the Martin Luther King High School. She was on the varsity top seven and when this transgender student transferred [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  to the girls high school Taylor was removed from the varsity team and in her place this biological male was placed on her team. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=145.72s)]
*  This student did not meet any of the varsity top seven eligibility requirements. Taylor blew those eligibility requirements out of the park. The one qualifying [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=155.44s)]
*  factor that the athletic director considered when replacing Taylor was this student's time. He is a biological male and of course he did run faster than my client Taylor. And so [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=167.44s)]
*  we brought this Title IX cause of action against the school district. And then the other side of this is a free speech cause of action following [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=179.92s)]
*  Taylor's displacement on the varsity team. The girls wore shirts that said save girls sports. That's what the front of the shirt said. They wore it to their practice and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=189.52s)]
*  the athletic director told them that they needed to hide their shirt or change their shirts because that message save girls sports creates a hostile environment. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=198.4s)]
*  She went on to compare this message to a student wearing a swastika in front of Jewish students. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=207.28s)]
*  So Riley you're wearing the shirt right there. That's that that's the shirt right. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=216.24s)]
*  Yes it is. When you heard that somebody had compared it to a swastika wearing that shirt is compared to a swastika. What do you make of that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=221.84s)]
*  It was honestly disappointing in our staff at our school that's a mass genocide and to compare [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=230.24s)]
*  a very broad term to such a horrible time in history was quite honestly disappointing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=238.72s)]
*  Indeed. Julianne since you're the lawyer I'm going to read part of the statement that the school district sent to us regarding this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=246.0s)]
*  They said it is important to remember that the school district is bound to follow California law which requires that students be permitted to participate in sex segregated school programs [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=253.28s)]
*  and activities including athletic teams and competitions and it goes on and on. But my point is they say Julianne that they are required by law to do that because otherwise it would be discrimination. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=263.2s)]
*  But you say it's not discrimination. That's right. Well you know that statement completely misses the mark of the entire lawsuit. First of all it's a Title 9 issue which Title 9 requires fair and equal treatment. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=275.12s)]
*  You cannot discriminate based upon sex and that's quite frankly what the school district did. They treated Taylor less favorably than they did this transgender student. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=288.8s)]
*  We understand what California law is. We understand that biological boys are going to are allowed to compete and participate in girls sports and that's part of the reason why these girls have taken a bold stand and said we're not OK with that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=298.48s)]
*  But in the meantime if California is going to ignore biology they at least need to treat females with equal treatment and not less than. Everyone has these particular rights. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  That doesn't mean that you favor one person's rights at the expense of another person's rights like these girls. It's all about fairness. Riley and Julianne thank you very much for getting us getting up so early not even five o'clock out in California. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  We'll catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMwSodT7dw&t=340.64s)]
