# Sen. John Kennedy: There is a Hamas wing of the Democratic Party
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ)
*  I think you should get a one-year jail sentence if you do anything to desecrate the American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=0.0s)]
*  flag. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=6.44s)]
*  Now, people will say, oh, it's unconstitutional. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=7.44s)]
*  Those are stupid people. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=10.28s)]
*  Those are stupid people that say that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=11.72s)]
*  We have to work in Congress to get a one-year jail sentence. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=13.8s)]
*  When they're allowed to stomp on the flag and put lighter fluid on the flag and set [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=16.88s)]
*  it afire, when you're allowed to do that, you get a one-year jail sentence, and you'll [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=21.84s)]
*  never see it again. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=27.28s)]
*  And all over the world, Putin and President Xi of China, all over the world, they're watching [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=28.64s)]
*  this. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=33.84s)]
*  Kim Jong-un, he looks at us like we're a bunch of babies. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=34.84s)]
*  And, by the way, they defiled property and our monuments. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=37.28s)]
*  Fox News alert former President Trump sounding off. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=41.4s)]
*  Sounding off on the anti-Israeli protesters who burned the American flag and the Israeli [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  flag, vandalized monuments. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=48.16s)]
*  This has the prime minister of Israel address Congress yesterday. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  And the Israeli prime minister was set to meet with President Biden today and a little [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  bit later with Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=57.6s)]
*  Then he'll meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago tomorrow. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  Senator John Kennedy joins us now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=64.12s)]
*  Senator, I love that speech. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=65.64s)]
*  Powerful, direct, easy to understand, made you understand who the good guys were. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=67.48s)]
*  What was it like in the gallery? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, there were some things that went on in the gallery that were disgraceful. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=75.4s)]
*  But President or rather Prime Minister Netanyahu gave an exceptionally powerful speech in a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=79.44s)]
*  nice way. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=86.56s)]
*  He told President Biden to stop pulling the rug out from under Israel and let Israel win. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=88.12s)]
*  And maybe now that President Biden is no longer running, he will do that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=94.68s)]
*  I don't hate President Biden. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=100.68s)]
*  I don't hate anyone. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=102.2s)]
*  But I think President Biden and Vice President Harris is stumbling and fumbling with respect [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=103.72s)]
*  to Israel is one of the reasons that President Biden got out of the race. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=109.76s)]
*  The two overarching reasons, of course, his speech last night, notwithstanding, are, number [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=116.26s)]
*  one, the president regretfully can't finish a sentence without taking a nap. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=122.66s)]
*  And number two, he was about to get beat. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=129.54s)]
*  He was polling right up there with cholera. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  Now, I respect President Biden when he said, I won't get out of this race unless God [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=134.54s)]
*  tells me. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=142.42s)]
*  And I'm a Christian. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=143.57999999999998s)]
*  Maybe God talked to him. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  But I think it's equally probable that God's voice sounded suspiciously like Barack Obama's, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=145.88s)]
*  who told President Biden if he didn't get out and let Vice President Harris run, that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  President Barack Obama was going to destroy President Biden. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=159.72s)]
*  And Washington, sometimes your friends are more dangerous than your enemies. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=168.6s)]
*  Senator, those protests yesterday, outrageous, as bad as it gets, defiling public property, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=169.6s)]
*  beating up people that tried to stop the burning of the American flag, chasing them away, chanting [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=175.12s)]
*  Al-Aqbar, death to America, praising a terrorist group in the capital of our country. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=179.8s)]
*  The president says, put him in jail for a year. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=188.52s)]
*  What does Senator Kennedy say? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=190.44s)]
*  I say that there is a Hamas wing of the Democratic Party, just like there's a lone wing of the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=192.36s)]
*  Democratic Party. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=200.2s)]
*  And many of them support this stuff. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=202.56s)]
*  President Trump's correct. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=205.48s)]
*  Here's the bottom line. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=208.36s)]
*  Hamas is backed by Iran. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  Iran wants to kill every member of the Israeli nation. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=212.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=217.32s)]
*  Iran wants to kill every American. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=218.32s)]
*  They want to hurt us both the entire time we're dying. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=220.52s)]
*  And then they want to drink our blood out of a boot. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  We have to beat them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=227.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  First, we've got to stop financing them. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  That would certainly help. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=232.4s)]
*  Crack down on their nuclear program. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=233.4s)]
*  Stop letting them sell their oil. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=234.4s)]
*  Senator, we have so much to talk about, but I also know this is important. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=235.8s)]
*  Senator Durbin says that Congress has a responsibility to get to the bottom of the Secret Service, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=239.32s)]
*  failed how they failed to protect President Trump. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  It seems to be bipartisan. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=245.0s)]
*  They announced a joint Judiciary Committee classified briefing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=246.76s)]
*  It will be a hearing on the Trump assassination attempt. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=251.0s)]
*  You're on the Senate Judiciary Committee. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=255.0s)]
*  When is this going to happen? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=257.32s)]
*  What questions do you have? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=258.72s)]
*  I'm going to chase our witnesses like they stole Christmas. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=260.8s)]
*  I'm going to do everything in my power to get to the bottom of it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=264.8s)]
*  So far, we think that the shooter may not have been left-wing or right-wing, but a broken [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  wing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=274.36s)]
*  But that's no excuse. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=275.8s)]
*  There were huge lapses by Secret Service. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=278.02s)]
*  We need, as head of our Secret Service, a wolf. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=281.96s)]
*  We had a poodle. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=286.65999999999997s)]
*  She resigned. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  That's good. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  She's going to be back in front of us. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=290.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=292.76000000000005s)]
*  She resigned. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=293.76000000000005s)]
*  We got some information from the FBI. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  You know where we get most of our information from? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=296.6s)]
*  Reporters. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=298.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=299.48s)]
*  Witnesses, people that went there, cell phone video. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=300.48s)]
*  We're ahead of the FBI director of what he wants to tell us. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  Please let them know we're not waiting for the investigation, but I look forward to it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=306.36s)]
*  And I encourage that it seems to be bipartisan. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  Senator, thanks so much. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  It was great to talk to you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkQmnkys0FQ&t=313.28000000000003s)]
