# Steve Moore: ‘Switchboards are lit up’ as world leaders call Trump
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ)
*  Vice President JD Vance in Italy for a second day of tariff talks as many nations still look to cut a deal with the United States [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump just spoke with the UK's prime minister and trade was one of the top issues that they discussed former Trump economic [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=8.22s)]
*  Advisor and co-author of the Trump economic miracle Stephen Moore joins us now, sir [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=15.18s)]
*  What are your thoughts on all of this and the posturing of some European nations? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Well, good morning guys, so, you know Charlie knows I'm a kind of old-fashioned Milton Friedman free trader [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=26.2s)]
*  But I got to tell you that what Trump is doing is kind of ingenious. He's really [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=32.96s)]
*  I'm told by my friends in the White House that this switchboards are little lit up with every every leader [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  trying to get a hold of Donald Trump and cut a deal here and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=45.0s)]
*  At the end of the day if Trump can pull this off and it looks like it's working [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=48.56s)]
*  You're gonna see I think a lot of these countries [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=53.32s)]
*  Agreeing to reduce their tariffs on American-made products which will increase demand and increase jobs [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=57.0s)]
*  And then you what you got going on is this kind of remember that old game up, you know [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=63.8s)]
*  Where you run around the table and you musical chairs? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=69.0s)]
*  Well, there's always one less one more person than chairs and what Trump is saying [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=72.6s)]
*  You don't want to be the last person standing and so I'm feeling more and more confident every day [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=77.8s)]
*  That this is gonna work and when it does because you know, the the stock market has been like I'm getting motion sickness [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=84.2s)]
*  Why should I go up and down up and down? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=90.52s)]
*  But but I think at the end of the day we're gonna see Trump [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=92.52s)]
*  We're gonna see a big rally in the market as soon as these deals get caught and I think that's gonna be soon [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=96.12s)]
*  And you and you really don't want to be the the one guy without a seat when the music stops [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=101.76s)]
*  Which is even even worse. How do you think? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=107.0s)]
*  You know, I think one of the things that the White House expects is or is sort of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  Speculating on is that China is in a much weaker position than I think a lot of people recognize and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=115.92s)]
*  My hunch is that all of this has more to do with China than it does with anything else [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  What do you think China is how do you think China views all of this right now? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=127.48s)]
*  well, look China is the real enemy here and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=133.16s)]
*  They are a dangerous country, you know, they're building up their military. They're involved in incredibly predatory [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=136.68s)]
*  Trade practices that that do damage to the United States. And so I think the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=142.4s)]
*  Strategy here Charlie is to isolate China [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=149.32s)]
*  Force them because they're they're the real bad actor here. And I think at the end of the day again, you're gonna see China [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  Look China's economy cannot grow [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=159.32s)]
*  They would go into a great depression if they could not trade with the United States and had access to our [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=161.84s)]
*  $20-trillion consumer market and so Trump is holding the cards and finally [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=167.52s)]
*  We have a president who's using those to to force China act to act like a civilized country and to and level the playing field [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=171.52s)]
*  I mean their their tariffs are three to four times higher than ours are right [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=178.76s)]
*  well not just level the playing field for [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=183.52s)]
*  You know among all the different countries in terms of you know [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=186.28s)]
*  Tariffs on our stuff and tariffs no tariffs for their stuff [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=190.32s)]
*  but also for people it seems like there's this arrangement where globalists and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  corporations all benefit from these the arrangements that we have for cheap goods from other countries and they kind of tell us [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=200.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you're lucky you get all these cheap goods from China. Meanwhile, the middle class [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  The working class has been thrown out of jobs. All their jobs have been shift over. So it's also a transfer of wealth [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=212.46s)]
*  I think eventually to the to the working class, right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=218.32s)]
*  Well, look more jobs in the United States is a good thing and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=223.28s)]
*  We we have the strongest economy in the world. Everybody has to trade with us [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=227.68s)]
*  I always say we're the alpha male and the in the world economy and Trump is very strategically [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=232.06s)]
*  Using American power finally, we have a president to do this to say hey, you know, you're cheating us [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=238.28s)]
*  What's the term that Trump's use all the time you're ripping us off and we're not gonna we're taking the kick me sign [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=244.32s)]
*  Off of us and we're gonna start, you know fighting back on this [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  Look, I want to see at the end [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=253.72s)]
*  I want to make sure that the terrorists everywhere come down because I do think when nations trade [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=255.48s)]
*  This is the essence of economics when two countries trade with each other voluntarily by definition [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=260.68s)]
*  They're better off and it and it also promotes peace [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=265.8s)]
*  Steven more thank you for always breaking it down for us so that even those of us who don't get math understand it [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ1uUefDusQ&t=268.76s)]
