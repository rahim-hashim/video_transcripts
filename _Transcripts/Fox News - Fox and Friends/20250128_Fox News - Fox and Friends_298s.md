# 'UNPRECEDENTED': ICE director praises Trump WH for taking 'handcuffs off' agency
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI)
*  So DHS sources confirm it's a Fox News. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=0.0s)]
*  New York City is the next target for ICE raids [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=2.84s)]
*  as deportation efforts continue in Chicago. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=6.24s)]
*  This as over 1,200 illegal immigrants [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=9.32s)]
*  who were charged or convicted with committing crimes [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=11.4s)]
*  on American soil are detained nationwide. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=14.48s)]
*  ICE Chicago Field Office Director Sam Olson [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=18.12s)]
*  has been on the ground working directly [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=21.6s)]
*  with Border Zara Tom Holman, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=22.96s)]
*  and he's been kind enough to join us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=24.16s)]
*  Special Agent, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=25.88s)]
*  Hi, thanks. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=30.36s)]
*  Thanks very much for having me. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=31.2s)]
*  So tell us, how does this process work? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=32.2s)]
*  How do you find these people? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=34.88s)]
*  And tell us some of the folks [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=37.08s)]
*  that y'all been able to capture so far. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=38.44s)]
*  Sure, yeah, it's kind of an arduous process, right? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=43.24s)]
*  It's we're in a difficult situation here in Chicago [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=46.2s)]
*  because a lot of the targets that we're looking at [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=48.84s)]
*  were previously arrested by local or state authorities, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=51.06s)]
*  and we've placed holds on many of them, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=54.16s)]
*  and they were released from a facility [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=56.24s)]
*  into the communities again. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=58.56s)]
*  So we have to go through, you know, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=60.92s)]
*  spend a lot of hours researching where they're living, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  and then actually go out into their environment [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=65.76s)]
*  to try to arrest them. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=69.36s)]
*  So Special Agent, just to put this in context [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=70.72s)]
*  for our audience, these folks didn't only commit crimes [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=73.06s)]
*  in their home country, but they came here to America, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=76.36s)]
*  and they committed crimes here as well, right? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=80.34s)]
*  That is correct, yeah. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=84.84s)]
*  We've had many targets here [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=85.76s)]
*  that have really kind of egregious convictions [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=87.12s)]
*  for sexual assault, for murder, for aggravated battery, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=90.2s)]
*  drug possession, we've arrested gang members so far. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=93.88s)]
*  So yeah, there's just a litany of criminal convictions [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=96.92s)]
*  that the targets that we've arrested have. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=99.42s)]
*  Special Agent, I was able to see some of the footage [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=101.32s)]
*  that you have, and I saw not only ICE, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=103.6s)]
*  which is probably leading this effort, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=105.72s)]
*  but I saw DEA as well as ATF for this joint task force. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=108.12s)]
*  But I also was told that you have a DOJ attorney [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=113.12s)]
*  to make sure you guys are doing this by the book. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=116.8s)]
*  So tell us about that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=119.44s)]
*  Why do y'all have someone in the DOJ [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=120.96s)]
*  to make sure everything is square? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=123.4s)]
*  It's really been amazing so far in this administration, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=127.08s)]
*  the support that we've been getting. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=129.72s)]
*  This is essentially like an unprecedented [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=131.12s)]
*  whole of government approach that we're experiencing, yeah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=133.52s)]
*  Because along with ICE, both enforcement [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=136.4s)]
*  and removal operations and Homeland Security investigations, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=138.4s)]
*  we have agents from ATF, DEA, US Marshals, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=141.38s)]
*  and the FBI out here, and along with attorneys from DOJ [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  and attorneys from our own ICE offices. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=148.98s)]
*  So it's just been an amazing the support that we're getting [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=152.82s)]
*  because some things that have been difficult [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=155.62s)]
*  to coordinate before, because there's so many [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=157.06s)]
*  different agencies, we've been able to get everybody [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=159.16s)]
*  in the same room and get kind of real-time updates, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=161.32s)]
*  real-time intelligence, and real-time advice [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=164.3s)]
*  to make sure that we're doing this the right way. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=167.62s)]
*  You know, Special Agent, I know Fusio, their task force, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=169.54s)]
*  are some of the most difficult situations [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=172.14s)]
*  for your agents that are there on the ground. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=174.34s)]
*  They're very dangerous, especially people [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=176.22s)]
*  that have nothing to lose because they know [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=178.34s)]
*  they're gonna be deported. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=179.94s)]
*  I wanna talk about some of the criticism [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=181.7s)]
*  from some of the people in the media, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=183.34s)]
*  as well as some people that may have [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  different political views. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  They're saying that you guys are targeting people in schools, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=189.26s)]
*  trying to break up communities. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=192.57999999999998s)]
*  What would you say to those folks [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=194.42s)]
*  that don't really understand how this task force works? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=196.14s)]
*  Right, and what we're doing is we're targeting [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=201.82s)]
*  the worst first, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=203.94s)]
*  That's who we're getting. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=205.73999999999998s)]
*  We're focusing on those targets. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=206.94s)]
*  We're not targeting people in schools. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=209.01999999999998s)]
*  We're not targeting people in churches. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=210.94s)]
*  We're targeting people who are the worst. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=212.42s)]
*  You know, there's a chance they're gonna go [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=214.98s)]
*  to some of those places, and this administration [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=216.73999999999998s)]
*  has kind of taken some of the handcuffs off of us, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  in a way, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=222.33999999999997s)]
*  We're leaving the discretion with our officers, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=223.17999999999998s)]
*  and our officers are trained to make [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=225.06s)]
*  good decisions out there, and we support them, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=226.46s)]
*  and that's the one thing that we have to realize. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=229.02s)]
*  These officers now, when we could have arrested somebody [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=230.66s)]
*  at a safe facility, right, a jail or a court lockup, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=233.46s)]
*  with one or two officers, and now we have to go out [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=236.94s)]
*  into the streets, and now most of our teams [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=239.58s)]
*  are at least 10 agents and officers [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=241.78s)]
*  trying to arrest one individual. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=243.86s)]
*  You know, Special Agents, you got a tough day today. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=246.18s)]
*  I don't wanna tip off the criminals, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=249.58s)]
*  but what's the plan for the day? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=251.66s)]
*  The plan is today, just like we've been doing in the past, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=256.02s)]
*  and just like we're gonna do, you know, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=259.34s)]
*  each day going forward, we're gonna have multiple teams [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=260.78000000000003s)]
*  out in the field, in multiple cities, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=263.7s)]
*  looking for the worst of the worst. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=266.06s)]
*  Yeah, Special Agent, thank you for all that you do. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=268.22s)]
*  I see you with your vest on. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=270.74s)]
*  Keep it on, and give my best to all the other agents [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=272.5s)]
*  that are there on the ground. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=275.82s)]
*  No, I appreciate it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=278.78s)]
*  Thanks for the time. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=279.74s)]
*  I appreciate the support, and just thanks for, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=280.58s)]
*  thanks for helping us tell our story. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=283.70000000000005s)]
*  You got it, brother. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  Take care. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SSkIZk37bI&t=286.70000000000005s)]
