# 'Stop blaming inflation': Democrat defends Kamala Harris' price control plan
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08)
*  Vice President Harris and former President Trump rallying voters in Pennsylvania this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=0.0s)]
*  weekend as they get ready to debate each other. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=5.92s)]
*  Trump turning to Tulsi Gabbard to help him prepare with her experience sharing the stage [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=8.84s)]
*  with Harris. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=12.92s)]
*  Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=14.8s)]
*  president but I'm deeply concerned about this record. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=19.2s)]
*  There are too many examples to cite but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=22.48s)]
*  violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=27.02s)]
*  When you were in a position to make a difference and an impact in these people's lives, you [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=30.82s)]
*  did not. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=35.74s)]
*  And the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor, you owe them an apology. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=36.74s)]
*  So here to react is former Democratic Pennsylvania Congressman Patrick Murphy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=42.46s)]
*  Patrick, you're already smiling. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=47.06s)]
*  Are you, are you, so Tulsi Gabbard's playing Kamala Harris in debate prep for Donald Trump. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  Trump Tulsi Gabbard kind of eviscerated Kamala Harris in the Democratic primary debates some [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=55.98s)]
*  time back. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=62.3s)]
*  How do you think this is going to go? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=63.699999999999996s)]
*  We've got less than a month now between Trump-Harris debate stage. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=65.34s)]
*  Yeah, well great being home with you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=70.1s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=72.66s)]
*  Listen, Tulsi Gabbard's a friend. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=73.66s)]
*  She's a fellow Iraq war veteran. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=74.66s)]
*  And the reality of the world is if she was the Vice President nominee with Donald Trump, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=77.74s)]
*  I think they'd have a much stronger ticket. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=82.25999999999999s)]
*  She's a great American. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=84.78s)]
*  In fact, I told her I texted her this morning, I'll be on with you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=86.58s)]
*  So listen, I think it's going to be a showdown on September 10th. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=88.1s)]
*  It's my hometown of Fadopi. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=93.74s)]
*  It's going to be the National Constitution Center. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=97.02s)]
*  She's a sharp warrior and I'm sure she's doing what she can to help the other side. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=98.02s)]
*  And I'm just going to say this, I'm not robbing you of this. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=104.18s)]
*  I'm not rebutting you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=106.38s)]
*  JD Vance, by the way, also a veteran, also in Iraq. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=107.7s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, yeah, no. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=110.86s)]
*  I don't think you were taking anything away from JD Vance. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=111.86s)]
*  I've always been respectful for JD Vance. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=113.86s)]
*  There's a difference. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=116.14s)]
*  I mean, we're respectful to the veterans and he wasn't overly respectful to my former [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=117.14s)]
*  roommate Tim Walz, but you know, it is what it is. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=121.38s)]
*  Well now to be fair on that, Patrick, this wasn't where we were going to go, but you [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  and I have good back and forth conversations. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=126.89999999999999s)]
*  No one is criticizing Tim Walz's 24 years of service. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=128.85999999999999s)]
*  The question remains whether or not he exaggerated those 24 years of service, both with the title [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=131.7s)]
*  that he claimed in Command Sergeant Major and whether or not his deployment was to combat [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=136.5s)]
*  or even in support of combat. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=141.45999999999998s)]
*  A deployment to Italy shouldn't be played up as a deployment to Afghanistan or Iraq. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=143.34s)]
*  And you can point that out. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=148.14000000000001s)]
*  One could argue you should point that out and still not be taking away from the 24 years [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=149.74s)]
*  of service of Tim Walz. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=155.10000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, again, well, like they said, he said the word stolen valor, which makes [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=156.5s)]
*  it question his character and his service, which is not the case. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=162.54000000000002s)]
*  He has given thousands, thousands of speech. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=165.66000000000003s)]
*  Tim Walz has never really said, ever said he served in combat. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=167.46s)]
*  He misspoke once about weapons of war in war, but he carried weapons of war. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=171.66s)]
*  The reality is this, well, as you know, he served our nation for 24 years. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=175.78s)]
*  He did deploy under Operation Enduring Freedom. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=180.86s)]
*  He left his wife, his job, his kids. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=183.78s)]
*  But that's not to Afghanistan. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=185.38s)]
*  That's what has to be clarified. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=187.46s)]
*  I think sometimes that statement has been run out by Tim Walz to suggest he was in Afghanistan. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=188.98000000000002s)]
*  He wasn't. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=194.46s)]
*  He was in Italy in support, in the support of Operation Enduring Freedom. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=195.46s)]
*  Right. And we should honor the fact that less than 1% of our nation, including Pete, who's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=200.38s)]
*  a great American as well, served, JD Vance served as well. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=205.46s)]
*  So, you know, they're being cued by, not you, other folks are being cued by frankly attacking [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=208.7s)]
*  the service. And he is just a great American. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=214.02s)]
*  And I think we should honor the fact that he served and he deployed, which is less than [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=216.54s)]
*  1% of our nation in the longest wars in American history. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=220.7s)]
*  So it is what it is. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=222.98s)]
*  And he was and real quick, and he was a command sergeant major. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=224.54s)]
*  He didn't retire at that rank, but he was a command sergeant major in that role. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=227.1s)]
*  But we're good. But I don't listen. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=230.5s)]
*  I'm not trying to get us off track. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=232.26s)]
*  I know we kind of disagree on this, but I respect Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=234.38s)]
*  I respect Tim Walz. I respect JD Vance. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=237.9s)]
*  I just wish folks really respected Tim Walz. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=240.26s)]
*  And I'm not saying you because I know you do. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=242.94s)]
*  But like other folks who are hitting him, I think it's distasteful at least. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=244.62s)]
*  I hear you. I will tell you, I think you can honor his service while questioning whether [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=249.06s)]
*  or not that has been exaggerated for political gain. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=253.7s)]
*  I do want to move to this as well with you. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=256.66s)]
*  That debate stage where we started, this has got to come up, Patrick. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=259.5s)]
*  And quite honestly, I don't know where you're going to go because I you know, are you you [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=262.98s)]
*  have been a moderate Democrat throughout your career. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=267.86s)]
*  We're not talking about moderate stuff here, Patrick. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=270.1s)]
*  Price controls, as suggested now by the Democratic candidate for president, is serious, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=272.46s)]
*  radical stuff that has been tried in America and failed. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=277.98s)]
*  But but the type of stuff we've seen in places like Venezuela, price controls. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=282.14s)]
*  That is not going to a I don't think is defensible on a debate stage. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=286.34s)]
*  I'd love to hear as defensible this morning on Fox and Friends. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  Listen, I think what what the vice president is saying in the plan moving forward is that I [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=294.17999999999995s)]
*  think there's a real discomfort in America that, you know, oil and gas companies have [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=299.73999999999995s)]
*  record prices yet. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=304.78s)]
*  Yet gas prices were five dollars. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=306.05999999999995s)]
*  They're now down to three. But still, you know, it could be lower. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=307.73999999999995s)]
*  This is about groceries. To be clear, this is about groceries with margins of one and a half. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=311.17999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And the same thing when she said her line in North Carolina, it was very strong. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=315.58s)]
*  She's talking about supermarkets. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=319.82s)]
*  So, you know, some supermarkets are making record corporate profits and not pass on the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=321.82s)]
*  cast cost savings. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=325.86s)]
*  So I think there's a really call for transparency and like, hey, that's how the shared [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=327.18s)]
*  sacrifice for making record profits. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=331.58s)]
*  The American people should, you know, and stop blaming inflation because inflation was [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=333.58s)]
*  at 9 percent, which was way too high. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=337.38s)]
*  A big part of that was, you know, was the eight trillion dollars that we went toward the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=339.21999999999997s)]
*  national debt under the Trump years. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=342.86s)]
*  Joe Biden, of course, added on to that for trying, but a train's really where it started. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=345.3s)]
*  The reality is this is that we got to do a better job for everyday American families. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=350.58s)]
*  And that's where our focus is going to be. And that's where I think just to be clear, I [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=354.34s)]
*  got to go. You think price controls is a wise answer to this inflate to solving inflation, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=357.38s)]
*  looking into price controls when it comes to groceries. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=362.02s)]
*  No, I think there's transparency and letting people know where the corporate dollars are [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=365.06s)]
*  going and how they should be passed down a part of it to the American people and to the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=369.62s)]
*  customers. I think capitalism is transparency. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=374.14000000000004s)]
*  I think, you know, the consumer, the consumer producer relationship is the definition of [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=376.94s)]
*  transparency. Patrick, we didn't take it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLzkqZMy08&t=382.38s)]
