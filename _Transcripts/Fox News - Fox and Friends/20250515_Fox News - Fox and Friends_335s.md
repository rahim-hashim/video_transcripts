# This was a 'keynote speech of presidency' during Trump's Middle East trip
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q)
*  Let's bring in KT McFarland, former Trump Deputy National Security Advisor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for coming in this morning. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=3.96s)]
*  It's a pleasure. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=5.2s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=6.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=7.2s)]
*  You were listening to the speech with us, sitting here on the curvy couch. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=8.2s)]
*  What were your thoughts? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=9.4s)]
*  This is the culmination of what Donald Trump started eight years ago. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=10.4s)]
*  Eight years ago, in the first couple of days of his administration, we're all sitting in [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=13.68s)]
*  the Situation Room, just like we're sitting here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=16.72s)]
*  And we're saying, what should our policy be towards the Saudis? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=19.12s)]
*  They were having an internal generational struggle. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=21.3s)]
*  And I said, well, we've always backed the old guys. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=23.92s)]
*  They've been doing business with us for 40 years. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=25.92s)]
*  And Trump says, no, we're going to have confidence in the next generation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=28.38s)]
*  The Saudis, we're going to have UAE, Qatar, we're going to go for the younger guys. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=32.56s)]
*  They're untried, they're untested, but they promise the future. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=38.18s)]
*  That was a huge bet that Donald Trump took. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=41.26s)]
*  He had the confidence that they would deliver. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=44.28s)]
*  And they have. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=46.06s)]
*  I mean, Mohammed bin Salman modernized his society, opened up his economy, and now, look, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=47.06s)]
*  President Trump is doing a victory dance. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  And people did point out that he brought up before that he thinks Qatar was a supporter [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=53.54s)]
*  of terror. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=58.22s)]
*  And he had brought up that people have to change in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=59.22s)]
*  And he brought up for the 9-11 families. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=62.42s)]
*  We still have a lot of questions about the hijackers. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=64.38s)]
*  But he seems to have also recognized that MBS is a new generation with a brand new focus [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=66.06s)]
*  and needs to be a fresh look. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  And also sees Qatar as much more complex than coming in and saying they support terror because [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=72.7s)]
*  Hamas is there. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=76.86s)]
*  They're also supporting Israel because they're a foundation for talks and for other things. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=78.02s)]
*  And also they were a place that we went to to get Afghanistan talks going in Doha with [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=83.16s)]
*  his administration. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=88.44s)]
*  And they also said, why don't you build an air base here and have a huge presence in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=89.92s)]
*  the Middle East and make it a hub? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=93.6s)]
*  So we kept that base. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=95.74s)]
*  It is a key base. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=97.72s)]
*  And at the same time, we don't love the fact that staying in the Four Seasons is three [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=98.72s)]
*  Hamas higher-ups. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  But you need somebody to be the guy in the middle to do the negotiating. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=105.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=109.6s)]
*  Otherwise, you're not having a negotiation, right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=110.6s)]
*  You're just sort of screaming at each other one way or the other. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=112.0s)]
*  So I think Qatar plays an extremely important, you know, pivotal position in this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=114.32s)]
*  Why is Donald Trump different than any other president when it comes to the negotiations [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=118.6s)]
*  with these countries? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=124.48s)]
*  I mean, I guess you've had other presidents that tried to, you know, share optimism, but [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=125.48s)]
*  he's leaning into the economic prosperity message and given countries almost a choice. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=133.2s)]
*  Either you, just like he did with Kim Jong-un, you take this for your people, you get your [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=139.96s)]
*  economy surging, or you can go to war with us. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=146.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=149.36s)]
*  And he said, I mean, the speech he made in Saudi Arabia is going to turn out to be one [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=150.36s)]
*  of the keynote speeches of his career and probably of American presidents in the last [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  several decades because he said, chaos, do you want chaos or do you want commerce? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=158.72s)]
*  Do you want war or do you want peace? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=164.36s)]
*  And when he then said, we're not going to tell you how you got to think, which God to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=166.16s)]
*  worship and how to govern yourself, that's up to you. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=170.32s)]
*  You modernize your own society, but we'll trade with you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=172.88s)]
*  And that's the key. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=176.0s)]
*  Every other president, whether it was George W. Bush, whether it was Biden, even whether [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=177.24s)]
*  it was Obama, let's all go to war. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=181.4s)]
*  You know, let's topple those leaders. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=183.2s)]
*  First Obama wants to apologize. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=184.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=185.2s)]
*  Well, first we apologize, then we topple your leaders with nothing left underneath it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=186.2s)]
*  But President Trump is saying, determine your own destiny. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=188.92s)]
*  And this is not a new thing with him. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=191.72s)]
*  When he was his first term, when he went to the UN General Assembly, he gave a speech. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=193.6s)]
*  People didn't really pay a lot of attention to what he said, but he said, you decide your [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=197.44s)]
*  own destiny. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=201.64s)]
*  America is no longer going to be the person who tells you how to think, what kind of government [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=202.64s)]
*  to have, what kind of society to build. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=207.0s)]
*  You do it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  KT, there's a report that NBC is reporting on that Iran's supreme leader told NBC that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  Iran is ready to sign this nuclear deal in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=216.0s)]
*  The headline on NBC is top Iranian official says Tehran would forgo highly enriched uranium [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=220.48s)]
*  in nuclear deal with Trump. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=228.12s)]
*  What do you think of it? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=229.44s)]
*  OK, so there's only one word that matters in that, and that's highly enriched uranium. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=230.44s)]
*  There are not, I mean, the whole point is that you should enrich it outside of the country. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=233.6s)]
*  Somebody else should enrich it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=238.04s)]
*  You bring it in. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=239.16s)]
*  But if Iran is allowed to have its enrichment facilities and they promise you, well, it's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=240.16s)]
*  only going to go to a certain level, it's only going to be low enrichment. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=243.72s)]
*  You just take the centrifuge and spin it around a few more times, you get a highly enriched [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=248.12s)]
*  uranium. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  So if we're going to empower Iran economically, we have to make sure that those enrichment [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  facilities are not in Iran because they could change anytime. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=257.4s)]
*  Well, and the problem is that Steve Witkoff put it in writing, and if the reports are [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=259.92s)]
*  correct and he says low enrichment, that's a problem. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  It's got to be zero enrichment. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  Zero enrichment, yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  And the president yesterday said zero enrichment. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  And then the report over the weekend was that the foreign minister of Iran went up to Saudi [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=270.0s)]
*  Arabia and the UAE and said, let's do a consortium. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=275.44s)]
*  And we agreed to enrich together outside our countries, which the UAE agreed to because [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=278.12s)]
*  they legitimately want nuclear power. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  Nobody believes Iran wants nuclear power. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=285.44s)]
*  And we went through the carousel of weapons inspectors with Iraq. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  One day they're not going to be allowed in and they're going to push in and they're [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=292.12s)]
*  going to pull out and they're not going to like one of our policies and they're going [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=294.67999999999995s)]
*  to kick the inspectors out. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=297.4s)]
*  They're going to begin to enrich uranium again. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=298.67999999999995s)]
*  Israel's not going to tolerate that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=301.4s)]
*  So if Steve Witkoff did that on his own, that's a huge problem. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=302.72s)]
*  Look, there's only one dealmaker in this administration who matters, and that's Donald J. Trump. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=307.12s)]
*  And he is the ultimate dealmaker and he is the ultimate closer. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=312.48s)]
*  So I would prefer to listen to what President Trump says and take him at his word. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=316.0s)]
*  Roger that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNfNO-ls19Q&t=319.52000000000004s)]
