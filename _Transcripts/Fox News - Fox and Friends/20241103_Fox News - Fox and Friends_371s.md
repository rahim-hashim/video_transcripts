# 'SHAMS AND NONSENSE': SNL grilled for last-minute Harris appearance before election
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw)
*  Joining us right now to preview their swing state campaign strategy in the final 48 hours is Eric Trump who probably would say that sounds just like his dad. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=0.0s)]
*  Eric, good morning to you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=8.08s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=9.08s)]
*  Hey, good morning, guys. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=10.08s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=11.08s)]
*  I'm doing okay. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=12.08s)]
*  Listen, Kamala Harris, I'm sure you know, was on Saturday Night Live across the street last night. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=13.08s)]
*  We have heard that the Trump campaign did not get an invitation from NBC. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=20.48s)]
*  Are you guys going to do that equal time complaint? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=26.6s)]
*  It's like how can you give her the time and not give him the time? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=29.92s)]
*  Listen, guys, we've dealt with this from day one, right, with ABC, with CBS, with NBC, with MSNBC. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=33.56s)]
*  I mean, we've dealt with this from day one. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  But you know, honestly, my father's stamina right now is unmatched. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=42.52s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=45.52s)]
*  I've never been more proud as a son. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=46.64s)]
*  I mean, in the next 36 hours, I just want to preview, in the next 36 hours, he has seven events. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=52.6s)]
*  It starts, you know, obviously today in Pennsylvania, then he goes to North Carolina, then he goes to Georgia. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=53.6s)]
*  I'm with him all day tomorrow, North Carolina, Pennsylvania. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  He's going to be in Redding, then he's going to be in Pittsburgh. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=60.0s)]
*  And then as he has the last two times, he's going to end up in Grand Rapids. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  But I mean, think about seven massive rallies in front of 40, 50, 60 thousand people. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=66.28s)]
*  I mean, these rallies are drawing massive crowds, but seven rallies in effectively 36 hours. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=72.36s)]
*  And I think that's the stamina that Americans want. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=77.28s)]
*  All right. I mean, that's the energy that Americans want out of our commander in chief. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=79.96s)]
*  And it's exactly what the current administration doesn't have. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=83.32s)]
*  It's exactly what Kamala hasn't had this entire campaign trail. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=85.96s)]
*  And I've never been more proud of that man right there. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=89.24s)]
*  I mean, the guy is working tirelessly. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=91.72s)]
*  The guy just never stops. And he wants to save this country. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  He wants to save the greatest nation on earth. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=96.08s)]
*  Hey, Eric, what is the conversation like with him the last, you know, when you're a few days away? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=98.36s)]
*  Because you all have been in this position to make sure he stays on message, talks about the economy, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=102.56s)]
*  things that that really resonate with the voter. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=107.08s)]
*  Well, it's kind of surreal for all of us. It's surreal for me. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  I did my last rally yesterday, my last kind of solo rally yesterday. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=114.44000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, it's been kind of a 10 year journey for us. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=117.48s)]
*  And, you know, it's winding down, meaning in terms of the campaign side at the same time. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=120.2s)]
*  It's so exciting because, you know, if we win on Tuesday, we can actually fix this country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  He can fix this country. He will. He'll take care of the economy. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=128.28s)]
*  He'll take care of prices on everything. He'll stop the wars. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=130.72s)]
*  He'll stop the bloodshed. He'll stop the invasion on the southern border. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=133.08s)]
*  He'll, you know, stop fentanyl, which is killing so many people in this country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=136.4s)]
*  Three hundred twenty thousand kids, to be exact. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=140.56s)]
*  So many of my friends have lost. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  I've had four friends who have lost kids to fentanyl. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=143.96s)]
*  You know, and we can fix these. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=146.6s)]
*  So, you know, in a way, it's bittersweet because here's 10 years of our life. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  And he's been doing this and he's done hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=152.04s)]
*  And it's really created a family out there. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=155.92s)]
*  I mean, this is not a political movement. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=158.4s)]
*  He's created a family of Americans who love this country, who love our flag. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  At the same time, it's beautiful because, you know, if people get out to the polls, if they vote, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=164.48s)]
*  we can he can do amazing things for this country, for this nation. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=168.64s)]
*  He can save the greatest country that's ever existed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=171.68s)]
*  And and he will and he'll do so better than anybody. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=174.72s)]
*  And everybody knows that. And so, you know, it's really kind of bittersweet in the last in the last few days. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=177.28s)]
*  Hey, Eric, just just bring that SNL. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=182.32s)]
*  I know the president is suing CBS for 10 billion dollars over changing the answers [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=184.88s)]
*  that Kamala Harris gave in her 60 minutes interview. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=191.0s)]
*  And then with ABC, the fact checks ends up wrong, especially when it comes up crime. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=193.8s)]
*  And then Lorne Michaels just said a couple of months ago, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=197.96s)]
*  you can't bring the actual candidates who are running on because of election laws and equal time provisions. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  Yet not only was she allowed on the person imitating her, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  Rudolph comes out and says, you know, basically, you got to win. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=211.28s)]
*  You I'm voting for you got to win. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=214.92s)]
*  So it wasn't even humor and you could take for what you will. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=216.56s)]
*  It was a campaign ad. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=219.56s)]
*  I mean, isn't this astounding to you even after 10 years? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  Brian, that one man in our family has fought the media every single day. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=225.16s)]
*  I mean, 92 percent of the mainstream media coverage on Donald Trump has been negative. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  And that's despite the largest tax cuts and again, the best economy, the lowest unemployment, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=233.8s)]
*  Peace in the Middle East, religious liberty, you know, protection of our constitution. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=238.04s)]
*  I could go on and on and on. And they're not playing that game. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=241.76s)]
*  I mean, everybody knows who the mainstream media is. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=244.44s)]
*  And frankly, that's why the podcast world has become so big. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=246.88s)]
*  That's why when you see him go on Twitter spaces with Elon Musk, he has a lot of people [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=249.56s)]
*  who go on Twitter spaces with Elon Musk. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=253.12s)]
*  He had what, two point one billion impressions of that podcast. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=255.0s)]
*  You see Rogan the other day. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=260.04s)]
*  People fundamentally don't trust the ABCs anymore. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=261.64s)]
*  You saw what happened in the debate where it was it was a three on one. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=264.12s)]
*  And you've seen that every single time. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  And so does this surprise us? No, it doesn't surprise us. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  Saturday Live has lost its spark. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=272.04s)]
*  It used to be when I was a kid, I watched it all the time. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=274.44s)]
*  It used to be incredible. It's totally lost its spark. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=276.8s)]
*  But there's no question that they are effectively the PR arm of the Harris campaign. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=278.92s)]
*  And they always have been. And, you know, at the same time, again, Americans read through it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=284.52s)]
*  They see that their pocketbook is not doing well. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=288.08s)]
*  They see that life has become unaffordable. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=290.88s)]
*  They see that they can't refinance their home because interest rates are 8 percent now. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=292.8s)]
*  And they used to be two and a half percent under my father. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=297.12s)]
*  That gas has tripled, that eggs have tripled, that auto insurance has literally gone up by 100 percent. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=299.28s)]
*  I mean, you know, guys, people feel it in their gut. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=305.12s)]
*  And I don't care how many kind of parody shows, I don't care what kind of coverage they get. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  People can read through the mainstream media at this point after a decade of these shams and this nonsense. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  And it's caused them to lose all credibility. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  And in fact, the media's credibility is the lowest it's ever been in the history of our country right now. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=321.92s)]
*  I mean, just no one no one trusts most of those mainstream channels. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=326.64s)]
*  And so I'm not sure if this Saturday Night Live stuff is going to ultimately matter. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  I think it's my father's work ethic that's going to matter. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  Again, seven rallies in 36 hours coming up. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=336.6s)]
*  No one can do that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=339.8s)]
*  And the guy's just a remarkable man. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=340.76s)]
*  I mean, he's truly a remarkable man. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=342.76s)]
*  I could not be more proud as a son. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=344.24s)]
*  Eric, it's all going to come down to Election Day. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=345.6s)]
*  I hear in the camp y'all feel confident, but people got to show up on Election Day. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=347.92s)]
*  It's not over yet. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=352.2s)]
*  We appreciate you giving us some time this morning. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=353.44s)]
*  Thanks, Lawrence. Thanks, guys. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl37IzeWbsw&t=357.92s)]
