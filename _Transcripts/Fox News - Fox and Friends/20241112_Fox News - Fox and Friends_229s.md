# 'Unhinged' left-wing women mocked for protesting Trump-voting men
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0)
*  All right, Democrats are staring down a decisive loss [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=0.0s)]
*  this election as the House GOP only needs four more seats [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=3.52s)]
*  to take the majority. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=7.68s)]
*  Our next guest says it was the ladies in red [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=8.84s)]
*  that swung this election to the Republicans [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=12.14s)]
*  with Trump beating Harris with a largest female demographic. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  New York Post columnist and author Miranda Divine [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=18.2s)]
*  joins us now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=20.76s)]
*  Our lady in red, hello Miranda. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=22.0s)]
*  Hi Ainsley. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=25.96s)]
*  Hi, okay what happened here? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=26.8s)]
*  If you were following her campaign, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  so many women thought she has it with them, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  but she did worse than Biden did with women [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  and Bill Clinton did with women. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=36.48s)]
*  And Hillary Clinton as well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=41.96s)]
*  Yes, and look, Donald Trump beat her by five points [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=42.8s)]
*  with the largest female demographic, white women, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=46.86s)]
*  and with young women, he did seven points better [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=50.92s)]
*  than he had in 2020. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=54.379999999999995s)]
*  So all the stories that we were told before the election [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=56.48s)]
*  that he was a misogynist and women hated him, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=60.16s)]
*  it was going to be a gender election, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  all of that was untrue. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=65.84s)]
*  And in fact, women voted as they usually do on the issues, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=68.08s)]
*  not just because they wanted some symbolic win for women [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=72.88s)]
*  with a female candidate, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=77.28s)]
*  or because they cared so deeply about abortion, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=79.08s)]
*  which seemed to be the only issue [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=81.96s)]
*  that Kamala Harris ever got passionate about. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=84.06s)]
*  There were much more important issues that women voted on [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=87.18s)]
*  because women are just people after all. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=90.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=93.34s)]
*  Rachel Compass Duffy was on our show [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=94.22s)]
*  and she has nine children. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=95.82000000000001s)]
*  I remember her saying, Latino women, we love our children, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=96.86s)]
*  we want babies, but we want to be able to feed them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=100.5s)]
*  And I think women do the grocery shopping. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=103.36s)]
*  My mom was a coupon cutter. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  We know what the prices are at the grocery store. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=107.18s)]
*  In 2016, Trump got 39% of the women, 2020, 43. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=109.7s)]
*  And then look at that in 2024, 46%. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=114.18s)]
*  Do you think the grocery store issue [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=117.54s)]
*  was the big issue here for women? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=119.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=123.46000000000001s)]
*  I mean, women know exactly how much, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=124.34s)]
*  the price of a pint of milk or a loaf of bread is, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=127.3s)]
*  and it's become much more difficult [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=131.86s)]
*  since Joe Biden got into office [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=134.66s)]
*  to afford just even the basics. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=136.94s)]
*  So that was a big issue, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=140.1s)]
*  but also the illegal migrant invasion, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=140.94s)]
*  that's been a real safety issue for women. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=144.73999999999998s)]
*  We've seen tragically women and girls like Lake and Riley [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=146.94s)]
*  have been raped and murdered by illegal aliens. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=152.06s)]
*  And Donald Trump made a big point of that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  And he said, I will protect you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=159.01999999999998s)]
*  And a lot of women want a president [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=161.06s)]
*  who is able to protect them, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=163.62s)]
*  not just from the illegal aliens, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=165.7s)]
*  but from all the gangsters around the world. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=167.5s)]
*  And protect our children. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  Miranda, let me ask you really quickly. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=169.9s)]
*  What do you think about this group, the 4B Movement? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=171.18s)]
*  These are women that are trying to punish men [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=173.18s)]
*  for voting for Donald Trump, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=175.06s)]
*  cutting their hair, breaking up. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=177.02s)]
*  Going on a sex strike. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=181.28s)]
*  I mean, they're hurting themselves more than anyone else. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=183.34s)]
*  And I think there are a lot of men [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=186.94s)]
*  that are breathing a sigh of relief and saying, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=189.46s)]
*  okay, go for it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=192.06s)]
*  Look, it's just a very self-defeating protest. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=193.66s)]
*  And I don't think it'll last all that long, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=198.70000000000002s)]
*  but it shows you just how unhinged [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  a lot of liberal women became over Donald Trump, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=204.1s)]
*  because they were told that he was a Nazi [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=207.3s)]
*  and a threat to democracy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=209.1s)]
*  And they believed the people who lied to them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=210.98000000000002s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=214.46s)]
*  Thank you so much, Miranda. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lWUyqFDi0&t=215.3s)]
