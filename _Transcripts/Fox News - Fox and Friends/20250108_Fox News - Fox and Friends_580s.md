# WATCH: Power line falls as strong winds fuel LA fires, engulfing homes
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ)
*  We'll go out to William Lajones, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=0.0s)]
*  who is live there in Malibu. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=1.6s)]
*  William? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=3.36s)]
*  That's worse. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=5.2s)]
*  Well Ainsley, it is a nightmare situation [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=6.04s)]
*  for Southern California and LA County. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  This is supposed to be the wet season, right? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=9.92s)]
*  We have no rain. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=11.52s)]
*  Of course we have a challenging topography, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=12.76s)]
*  also in these dense areas like the Palisades, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=15.32s)]
*  and then of course the winds [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=17.88s)]
*  that you're seeing right here picking up. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=18.96s)]
*  They're probably around 50 miles an hour [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=21.04s)]
*  down here at the coast where I'm at, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=22.64s)]
*  and around 90 mile an hours [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=24.52s)]
*  in the foothills in the mountains. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=26.16s)]
*  I'm gonna step aside right now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=27.6s)]
*  Keith can show you one of those residences [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=29.36s)]
*  that I showed you this morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=31.8s)]
*  It's obviously totally engulfed in flames, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=33.44s)]
*  and you can see how this is a wind driven fire. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=35.8s)]
*  They're trying to stop it from going to the next home, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=38.56s)]
*  which is right next door. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=41.36s)]
*  We have seen roughly about 10 to 12 homes [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=42.88s)]
*  go up this morning since we've been here, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  and these are really close together. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=48.6s)]
*  You can't see it, but the ocean is literally [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=49.92s)]
*  on the other side of that house. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=52.08s)]
*  We're right on Coast Highway, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=54.2s)]
*  and about the middle of Malibu, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=55.72s)]
*  which is 27 miles long. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=57.08s)]
*  We have, as you mentioned, about three major fires burning [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=59.76s)]
*  in five areas around Southern California. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=62.44s)]
*  It began yesterday in a residential area in the Palisades, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=65.08s)]
*  Pacific Palisades neighborhood, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=69.2s)]
*  and then with staggering speed with these winds, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=70.88s)]
*  it just kicked going over several different fire breaks [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=73.4s)]
*  to Panga Canyon and to the south, also into Santa Monica. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=77.22s)]
*  We have some sound here from a woman in the Palisades [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=81.48s)]
*  who witnessed what happened. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=84.12s)]
*  After being born and raised in the Palisades, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=87.24s)]
*  having seen numerous evacuations, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=89.64s)]
*  having been through earthquakes, fires, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=92.08s)]
*  whatever you can say, we've been through it all. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=94.12s)]
*  This was something I was never expecting. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=96.56s)]
*  And up and down Coast Highway, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=101.56s)]
*  a lot of power lines and posts are down. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=103.08s)]
*  In fact, Keith is shooting one right now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=105.8s)]
*  You can see the fire has already destroyed the cell tower [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=107.88s)]
*  there as well as the street lamps. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=110.8s)]
*  And over time, that thing's gonna come down [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=112.44s)]
*  along with some of the others [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=114.64s)]
*  that I've witnessed here this morning. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=115.86s)]
*  The scene you're seeing here is not unique by any means. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=117.33999999999999s)]
*  Up and down Coast Highway on both sides, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=120.74s)]
*  the ocean side, the windward side. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=122.97999999999999s)]
*  And you can see right now the wind is just so unpredictable. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=124.74s)]
*  Sometimes it's coming out of the north, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=128.0s)]
*  sometimes it's coming off the ocean [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=129.66s)]
*  and it's creating its own wind really, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=131.42s)]
*  which is challenging for firefighters. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=133.45999999999998s)]
*  This area right now is burning [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=136.22s)]
*  several houses here along Coast Highway. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=140.5s)]
*  Send it back to you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=142.42s)]
*  So William, I got a question for you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=143.5s)]
*  You've been covering these fires for decades out there. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=146.5s)]
*  So as we look at this fire there [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=149.02s)]
*  on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=150.7s)]
*  and we saw the crew spraying some water toward it, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=153.38s)]
*  are they spraying it on the fire [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=157.06s)]
*  that the house that is engulfed or on the house next door? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=158.54s)]
*  Because historically, you try to spray the roof [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=162.94s)]
*  so that the embers don't come over. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=165.42s)]
*  That's a losing proposition there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=167.38s)]
*  I mean, if that house is on fire next to my house, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=169.42s)]
*  my house is next. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=172.3s)]
*  And it is. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=174.46s)]
*  And it has moved, like I said, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=176.06s)]
*  about nine to 12 homes in a row, bang, bang, bang. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=178.98000000000002s)]
*  And that one they tried to save. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=182.26000000000002s)]
*  When we started it together this morning [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=183.58s)]
*  at six o'clock your time, that house was fine. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=186.12s)]
*  And so was the one next to it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=189.22s)]
*  But literally, let me put my goggles back on. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=190.66s)]
*  They're trying to cool it down. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=193.98000000000002s)]
*  The next one, a house over, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=195.5s)]
*  parts of this power line are going to go down. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=198.74s)]
*  It's very hard to, and there's no structure protection. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=204.26s)]
*  With winds like this, as you guys see, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=206.89999999999998s)]
*  it doesn't matter how much water you put on that fire, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=208.66s)]
*  the next home is gonna burn, and the one after. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=211.34s)]
*  They're only about a foot or two feet apart. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=213.7s)]
*  Ansley? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=215.98s)]
*  William, will you ask your cameraman to show our audience [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=216.82s)]
*  you did this during your last live shot? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=219.7s)]
*  All the homes, you said there were about 12 homes. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=222.44s)]
*  Throughout the course of this morning, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=225.29999999999998s)]
*  we've watched three go down. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  But if he pans over to the left, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=228.54s)]
*  you can see all the homes that used to stand on the beach. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=229.89999999999998s)]
*  Keith, I want you to pan. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=231.98s)]
*  Yeah, so Keith, I'm gonna have you pan slowly to your left, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=234.66s)]
*  and people are gonna be able to see what you see, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=237.98s)]
*  the remnants of the flames. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=240.38s)]
*  Those were all homes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=241.73999999999998s)]
*  And as you drive down PCH, you couldn't even see the water [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=243.26s)]
*  because they were home after home after home. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=246.92s)]
*  Now they are all gone. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=249.0s)]
*  And as he's gonna pan all the way over to those lights [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=250.5s)]
*  far down there, those were all homes, you guys. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=253.54s)]
*  They're gone. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=256.34s)]
*  And I got here, I don't even know what time, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=257.34s)]
*  but probably about four hours ago. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=259.5s)]
*  And I don't say half of them were standing, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=262.02s)]
*  but there was about six of them have been gone this morning. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=264.3s)]
*  And this situation is not unique. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=267.3s)]
*  As up and down PCH, these homes along the beach, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=269.66s)]
*  which are remarkably cool out on the deck and so forth, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=273.46s)]
*  overlooking the ocean, sometimes it goes underneath. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=276.66s)]
*  I used to run my dog along this beach, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=279.76s)]
*  and they're destroyed. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=281.78s)]
*  And we're talking expensive homes, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=284.14s)]
*  probably here along the coast, about $10 million each. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=286.5s)]
*  Holy cow. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=290.46s)]
*  William, has there been any improvement in the wind? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=291.3s)]
*  Because I know that is preventing the aircraft [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=293.78s)]
*  from getting up there to put some of that water down on it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=297.66s)]
*  No, Lawrence, the winds have actually, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=302.82s)]
*  they're very spotty. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=305.94s)]
*  They're worse now than they were an hour ago, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=308.86s)]
*  but it could go calm. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=312.42s)]
*  So they're very speculative, and they come and go, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=313.74s)]
*  and sometimes they're off the water, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=317.38s)]
*  and sometimes they're off the windward side, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=318.74s)]
*  or the offshore breezes. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=321.42s)]
*  But when the firefighters, you can see, they've pulled out. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=324.18s)]
*  I mean, not that they pulled out. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=328.76s)]
*  They're trying to cool down the next residence, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=331.02s)]
*  but there's no direct water on that flame at all, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=333.14s)]
*  because it's gone. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=335.58s)]
*  So, William, in Florida, when a hurricane hits, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=337.22s)]
*  they know what to do. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=340.06s)]
*  The people get instructions, but they know how to handle it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=341.28s)]
*  Same thing with fires in California, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=344.35999999999996s)]
*  that house is about to go. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=346.84s)]
*  Oh my goodness, be careful. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay, yeah, well, at least it went that direction, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=351.9s)]
*  and not this one. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there's power pulls up and down PCH, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=356.82s)]
*  because this situation, what can you do? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=360.79999999999995s)]
*  And you can imagine how long it's gonna take [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=364.64s)]
*  for us to get power. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=367.64s)]
*  There's 200,000 people in Southern California [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=368.72s)]
*  without power. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=370.56s)]
*  Our power was knocked out yesterday morning, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=371.68s)]
*  just as a precaution, because these high winds, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=374.36s)]
*  obviously you're gonna get more ignition sources. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=376.88s)]
*  So the wood pole just broke in half? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=380.0s)]
*  And it fell toward the water, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=382.96s)]
*  because had it fallen the other way, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=384.68s)]
*  that would have, you were right there, right? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, yeah, we were, I think we're far enough away, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=390.96s)]
*  it would have been scary, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  but no, we're purposely on the other side of the road. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=394.68s)]
*  But yeah, these power lines are down all along PCH. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=398.04s)]
*  So, you know, I showed you that there were. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=403.64000000000004s)]
*  Do you need to leave? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=407.32s)]
*  Are you safe? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=408.24s)]
*  It's raging right now. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=409.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, we're okay. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  We're okay, we can move the other direction [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=412.48s)]
*  if we needed to. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=415.6s)]
*  Right, so William, just a quick thing to finish my question. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=416.6s)]
*  Where do these people go? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=419.32000000000005s)]
*  They can't go to Santa Monica, right? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=420.98s)]
*  So are they just heading north? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, they can go over the hill to Agora, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  and to Calabasas, Woodland Hills, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=428.59999999999997s)]
*  Thousand Oaks, that kind of thing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=430.56s)]
*  But PCH is closed from the tunnel, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=432.12s)]
*  McClure Tunnel, coming off the 10, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=434.48s)]
*  all the way to, well, our first stop this morning [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  was right around Pepperdine. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=443.56s)]
*  So, but they probably moved that to the north, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=446.28s)]
*  because I've gotta imagine so many more people [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  are gonna wake up this morning [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=452.0s)]
*  and find themselves under a mandatory evacuation, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=453.8s)]
*  because this thing is moving so fast. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=456.72s)]
*  I gotta tell you, when I got up this morning [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=458.76s)]
*  and was looking at coverage, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=461.92s)]
*  it was all out in Pasadena and Altadena, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=463.72s)]
*  and there was nothing in Malibu, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=466.04s)]
*  there was no crews up here. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  And as I came south, I fully expected to make it [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=468.72s)]
*  to the Palisades, I didn't get halfway there, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=471.2s)]
*  because I started situations like this. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=474.48s)]
*  Is that where you live? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=476.98s)]
*  You live up around there? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=477.88s)]
*  Yeah, I live up near Yersuma. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=480.72s)]
*  So I come into West LA, it's about 26 miles, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=482.72s)]
*  but Pepperdine is probably about 10 miles south of me. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=486.76000000000005s)]
*  And the fire had reached, almost reached Cost Creek, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=490.72s)]
*  but it was a situation like you see here, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=494.8s)]
*  fire on the ocean side and fire on the retail [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=497.06s)]
*  on the land side, if you will. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=502.32000000000005s)]
*  Not quite to the town center, if you will, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=504.88000000000005s)]
*  but definitely. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=507.26000000000005s)]
*  What was that? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=511.8s)]
*  Well, I was gonna say probably a propane tank. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=513.64s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=517.64s)]
*  But I've watched these, you know, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=519.28s)]
*  I went through the Woolsey fire in my own neighborhood, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=521.52s)]
*  and you'd go in afterwards, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=523.88s)]
*  and the gas would still be going. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=526.0s)]
*  It sounded like a blowtorch. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=528.4399999999999s)]
*  The gas lines obviously haven't been cut off, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=530.76s)]
*  or could have been, but they haven't been. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=532.68s)]
*  And you'll see the gas running, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=534.92s)]
*  even when there's no house left. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  Can you imagine what the family's feeling [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=542.0799999999999s)]
*  if they're watching their house? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=543.96s)]
*  They were estimating, William, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=546.12s)]
*  that the peak winds would be between 10 p.m. last night [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=547.68s)]
*  and 5 a.m. this morning, which is your time right now [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=551.76s)]
*  out in Malibu. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=555.76s)]
*  We are going to let you step aside, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=557.0799999999999s)]
*  and you talk with your crew and figure out [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=558.92s)]
*  if you are safe to stay there, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=561.26s)]
*  or if you evacuate to another location, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=563.0s)]
*  and we will be back with you in a little bit. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKVPDDpJXQ&t=564.92s)]
