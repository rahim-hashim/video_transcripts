*  And for Joey, you're sitting overseas. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=112.8s)]
*  You've devoted your life to defend the country. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=114.8s)]
*  You've devoted your life to defend the country. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=116.8s)]
*  And you see images like this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=118.8s)]
*  And you see images like this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=120.8s)]
*  And you know that this is what people, some people, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=122.8s)]
*  a small minority of people back home are doing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=124.8s)]
*  What is that like for you when you're away from your family? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=126.8s)]
*  What is that like for you when you're away from your family? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=128.8s)]

*  You've agreed to literally surrender your life for this country. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=134.8s)]
*  It's absolutely devastating. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=136.8s)]
*  And when I think about even my fallen West Point class, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=138.8s)]
*  even my fallen West Point class that did not make it home alive. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=140.8s)]
*  And again, when I think about this folded flag that's been handed to widows [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=142.8s)]
*  And again, when I think about this folded flag that's been handed to widows [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=144.8s)]
*  as they lower their loved one into the ground, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=146.8s)]
*  as they lower their loved one into the ground, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=148.8s)]
*  that's what this flag represents to me. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=150.8s)]
*  And I just want people to respect that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=152.8s)]
*  But also, you know, Joey and I grew up, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=154.8s)]
*  and we're 80s babies, you know. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=156.8s)]
*  And we understood a time back in the day where, you know, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=158.8s)]
*  And we understood a time back in the day where, you know, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=160.8s)]
*  we had blockbuster movies and it was Tom Cruise. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=162.8s)]
*  and it was Tom Cruise. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=164.8s)]
*  And I saw Tom Cruise's Top Gun Maverick come out again. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=166.8s)]
*  And I've seen this resurgence of patriotism. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=168.8s)]
*  And this is all on the back of President Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=170.8s)]
*  This is why he won the election. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=172.8s)]
*  People want to feel good about their country again. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=174.8s)]
*  People want to feel good about their country again. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=176.8s)]
*  They want to have a love of their great nation. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=178.8s)]
*  What I saw at the White House with the fireworks display, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=180.8s)]
*  What I saw at the White House with the fireworks display, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=182.8s)]
*  and I saw the B-2 bomber fly over the White House [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=184.8s)]
*  when President Trump embraced Melania, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=186.8s)]
*  that's exactly what this country needs. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=188.8s)]
*  And I think we have it back in President Trump. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=190.8s)]
*  So while I'm disappointed in what I see people behave in this way, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=192.8s)]
*  I'm very happy about the future. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=194.8s)]
*  And not only that, Congressman, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=196.8s)]
*  President Trump also met with those B-2 fighter pilots [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=198.8s)]
*  that conducted Operation Minot Hammer. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=200.8s)]
*  So what do you think that moment was like for those fighter pilots? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=202.8s)]
*  So what do you think that moment was like for those fighter pilots? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=204.8s)]
*  Those fighter pilots got to exhibit peace through strength [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=206.8s)]
*  Those fighter pilots got to exhibit peace through strength [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=208.8s)]
*  of the likes that we have not seen in generations. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=210.8s)]
*  of the likes that we have not seen in generations. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=212.8s)]
*  They serve our country, they continue to serve our country, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=214.8s)]
*  and I am so proud of them. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=216.8s)]
*  And I'm also proud of President Trump [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=218.8s)]
*  that has committed to not putting boots on the ground [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=220.8s)]
*  unless it is absolutely necessary. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=222.8s)]
*  So the fact that we were able to debilitate, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=224.8s)]
*  to completely destroy basically, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=226.8s)]
*  Iran's ability to continue to move on with a nuclear weapon [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=228.8s)]
*  Iran's ability to continue to move on with a nuclear weapon [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=230.8s)]
*  while not putting boots on the ground, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=232.8s)]
*  and now no one's talking about it, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=234.8s)]
*  and those brave pilots that flew that mission [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=236.8s)]
*  proudly were able to get a call from the President [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=238.8s)]
*  proudly were able to get a call from the President [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=240.8s)]
*  and sit down and talk to him and thank him. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=242.8s)]
*  That's the America that I want to see. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=244.8s)]
*  That is the America that I will continue to fight for. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=246.8s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for joining us. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8XZGwS5Ys&t=248.8s)]
