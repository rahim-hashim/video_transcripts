# Californian who lost home invites Trump to Pacific Palisades: 'We can make change'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ)
*  Already the fires have consumed more than 62 square miles, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=0.0s)]
*  destroying over 12,000 buildings. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=3.14s)]
*  And that includes the home of our next guest. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=5.22s)]
*  Jake Steinfeld is the chairman of Body by Jake, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  the former honorary mayor of Pacific Palisades, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=9.76s)]
*  who is also working with Governor Schwarzenegger [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  on the Council of Fitness in California. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=15.64s)]
*  So Jake, clearly Pacific Palisades, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=17.98s)]
*  you knew your chances were slim [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=20.68s)]
*  that your house would survive. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  What happened? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=24.48s)]
*  Well, first of all, Brian, it's great to be here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  You know, I've been a friend of Fox and Friends, man, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=28.24s)]
*  since the year 2000. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=30.56s)]
*  You guys have always been great to me. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=32.68s)]
*  The audience is awesome. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=33.96s)]
*  I'm sitting here today, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=35.48s)]
*  not for a pity party that I lost my home. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's incredible, so surreal. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=39.68s)]
*  I can't tell you, I'm so thankful for my wife, Tracy, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=42.92s)]
*  my daughter Morgan flew in from London [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=46.28s)]
*  for my wife's birthday on Friday. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=47.94s)]
*  Surprise. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=50.28s)]
*  It's been unbelievably surreal. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=52.04s)]
*  And that's just the word. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=55.08s)]
*  But to say and to hear what I'm hearing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=56.8s)]
*  is unconscionable, very honestly. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  And I wanna first say this, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=64.2s)]
*  this is not about red or blue. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=65.88s)]
*  As you know me, this is about the red, white and blue. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=67.56s)]
*  This is why I'm very excited [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=70.42s)]
*  about this new administration coming in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=71.78s)]
*  where guys like President Trump are gonna take action. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=74.4s)]
*  And this is what we need to see, boots on the ground. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=78.16s)]
*  We can't have this again. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=81.24s)]
*  We don't live in a third world country [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=82.4s)]
*  to understand that whether water was depleted, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=84.52s)]
*  whether there was no power [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=88.2s)]
*  to get the water out of the hoses. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=92.0s)]
*  The first responders, the fire department, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  our men and women in service, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=96.8s)]
*  I take my caps off to them, people are despondent. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=100.44s)]
*  Look, there's been hurricanes [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=103.84s)]
*  and all kinds of catastrophes that we've all lived through. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=105.88s)]
*  I'm one of them now who's living through it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=109.58s)]
*  And it's not about the celebrities. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=112.64s)]
*  There are so many folks who have lost their homes [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=114.76s)]
*  in the palisades and out to Dena and everywhere else. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=118.28s)]
*  I wanna make sure that this next catastrophe, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=121.36s)]
*  because there's gonna be one that they are prepared, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=124.94s)]
*  that we are prepared as a state, as a nation [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=128.04s)]
*  where we live in a great state, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=131.52s)]
*  the highest tax state, right? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=133.68s)]
*  It's a gorgeous state. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=135.72s)]
*  And the bottom line is we need great leadership. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=137.12s)]
*  And I just wanna say, Brian, no, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=141.0s)]
*  I've known you, you know, do see in the gang for so long [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=143.48s)]
*  and the audience for so long. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=146.68s)]
*  It really is exciting for me. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=149.44s)]
*  Look, this is a brand new shirt, by the way, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  that I bought yesterday. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=154.8s)]
*  I have no clothes. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=156.16s)]
*  When was the last time you really had nothing? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=157.74s)]
*  I mean, I'm just, and I'm talking to everybody for a second. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  If you can close your eyes and visualize, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  you're sitting in your nice house right now [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  and we all have something. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=167.76s)]
*  We deal with something every single day, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=169.4s)]
*  but that something is taken away. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=171.88s)]
*  It's unbelievable, but I will tell you this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=174.6s)]
*  There are two ways you can go. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  You can curl up in a corner and die, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=179.22s)]
*  or you can say to yourself, don't quit. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=181.12s)]
*  You gotta get up. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=185.44s)]
*  The sun will come up tomorrow [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=186.66s)]
*  because it's coming up right now on the West Coast. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=188.1s)]
*  And you need to understand. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  People come up to me and say, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=192.96s)]
*  Jake, could you give us some inspiration, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=194.08s)]
*  some sense of hope? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=196.7s)]
*  And here's what I'm gonna say. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=198.28s)]
*  Get back to a routine. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=200.36s)]
*  Get back to your routine. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  I was up this morning. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=203.46s)]
*  Get into the gym. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=204.84s)]
*  Get your body moving. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=206.60000000000002s)]
*  Mental health is so important right now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=207.88000000000002s)]
*  It's the most important thing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=210.8s)]
*  But we wanna see transparency with insurance companies. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  Tell us about this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=215.84s)]
*  So Jake, you expressed to me that it's agonizing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=217.0s)]
*  to see governor and president not on the same page, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  and you have a message for the president. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=222.8s)]
*  I just wanna say this, Brian. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  I know the president watches your show, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=226.12s)]
*  and I just wanna say, look, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  President Trump, we're two guys from the neighborhood. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=232.56s)]
*  I'm gonna invite you to the Palisades, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=236.12s)]
*  and let's walk the neighborhood. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=239.16000000000003s)]
*  Let's take a walk in the neighborhood. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=241.52s)]
*  Meet the people, shake their hands. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  I think people will be very excited and very optimistic, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=245.10000000000002s)]
*  and know that something is going to get done. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=249.24s)]
*  This is not the red or the blue. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=252.32000000000002s)]
*  This is about the red, white, and blue. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  And I'm confident that when we take that nice walk, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=256.6s)]
*  we have a lot to talk about. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=261.16s)]
*  We're two business guys, and we can make change, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=262.68s)]
*  because we're gonna rebuild. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=266.04s)]
*  The Palisades is gonna rebuild. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=267.12s)]
*  I wanna make sure that this next catastrophe, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=268.52s)]
*  wherever it may be, is not gonna be [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=271.2s)]
*  what we have gone through here. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=275.28s)]
*  And this is not about, like I said, I lost my home. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=277.52s)]
*  It's the strangest thing to even talk about, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=282.56s)]
*  but we are going to rebuild. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=286.84s)]
*  And with the faith that I have and the understanding, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  friends like my friend Tim Robertson, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=292.96s)]
*  the son of the late great Pat Robertson, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=295.28s)]
*  leaves messages of Bible verses to us [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  from me and my wife Tracy. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=301.35999999999996s)]
*  It's been amazing, the outpouring of friends. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=303.4s)]
*  And it's really amazing to see the kind of people [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=306.76s)]
*  that do come out and really wanna help. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's been great. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=311.6s)]
*  The challenge is though, you have real estate people, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHlThb6P6yQ&t=312.68s)]
