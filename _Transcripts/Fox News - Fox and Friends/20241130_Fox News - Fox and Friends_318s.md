# Department of Education accused of weaponization against faith-based schools
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno)
*  A new report revealing Biden's Education Department is disproportionately punishing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=0.0s)]
*  faith-based universities with nearly 70% of enforcement actions going to those schools. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=6.0s)]
*  Just last year, the Department of Education slapped Grand Canyon University, the largest [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=12.0s)]
*  Christian university in the country, with a $37 million fine. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=15.52s)]
*  Brian Mueller is president of GCU, Grand Canyon University, and he joins us now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=21.12s)]
*  Brian, it's so great to have you on. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=26.64s)]
*  So before we talk about how unfair these fines have been, and we'll talk about the disproportionality [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=29.24s)]
*  of it, say, to Ivy League schools versus Christian schools, let's just first talk about why are [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=36.76s)]
*  they fining your university? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=43.08s)]
*  What are the causes for their investigations into your school? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=46.08s)]
*  Well, we came to the university 16 years ago when it was nearly bankrupt and only 900 students [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=50.04s)]
*  on campus. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=55.36s)]
*  And it's been an incredible success story. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=56.36s)]
*  We're very, very grateful and blessed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=58.68s)]
*  We've grown to 120,000 students. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=60.32s)]
*  Our campus is now ranked the 25th nicest campus in the country. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=62.2s)]
*  We put $2 billion into it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=66.16s)]
*  But we saw a chance to go back as a nonprofit university six years ago, and we executed [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=68.68s)]
*  that transaction. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=73.36s)]
*  And it was approved by the IRS and the Higher Learning Commission and everybody else that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=74.36s)]
*  needed to approve it, but it was denied by the Department of Education. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=77.88s)]
*  That was an unprecedented move, and we have no idea why they did that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  Eventually, because we couldn't come to a resolution, we filed a complaint. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  And once we filed a complaint, they started with retaliation. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=89.72s)]
*  They opened up five different investigations and finally centered on that we had misled [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=92.76s)]
*  somehow doctoral students. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=98.68s)]
*  And I said, are there any complaints from students? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=100.04s)]
*  And they said, no, we're not saying it's based upon complaints. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=102.76s)]
*  It's based upon how we read your website. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=105.0s)]
*  And I said, well, it was unbelievable what took place. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=107.04s)]
*  And then they came out with this proposal of a $37 million fine. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  It's only been a recommendation. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=119.0s)]
*  Obviously, we will fight that, fight it all the way to the Supreme Court. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=120.4s)]
*  But it was a fishing expedition. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=124.04s)]
*  They looked at thousands and thousands of documents and they came up with, well, we [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=125.76s)]
*  see this place where you could have misunderstood, a student could have misunderstood time and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=129.72s)]
*  cost to complete a degree. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=133.68s)]
*  And it was absolutely a ridiculous thing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=134.88s)]
*  And it resulted in a $37 million fine. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  This harassment is what it is. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=142.6s)]
*  By the way, I need to read the statement from the Department of Education to Fox News Digital. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=144.32s)]
*  They say, our top priority is protecting safety and academic opportunity for all students [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=149.32s)]
*  at institutions of higher education. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=153.56s)]
*  The data in the report itself pushes a false narrative by distorting information released [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=155.64s)]
*  publicly by the department. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  That is from the Department of Education run by Michael Cardona. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=162.16s)]
*  By the way, that's the same guy who got the Department of Justice to send letters to parents [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=164.68s)]
*  who were protesting the woke policies in their public schools and got them to be called domestic [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=170.62s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=177.54s)]
*  Twelve Christian schools have been targeted. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=178.54s)]
*  No Ivy League schools. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=182.54s)]
*  By the way, the fines against, for your school, which clearly a fishing expedition, the fines [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=185.02s)]
*  imposed on Penn State and Michigan State for sexual harassment with Larry Sarandusky and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=192.46s)]
*  I'm sorry, Larry Nassar and Jerry Sandusky, those fines, not even as large as the fines [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=200.06s)]
*  levied against your university and Liberty University. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=206.38s)]
*  It's just unbelievable. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=209.7s)]
*  Last word, Brian, on how you think things will change in terms of this weaponization [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=212.5s)]
*  of the federal government against Christian schools. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=217.9s)]
*  Yeah, you know, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the department was out of line. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=220.9s)]
*  It was a 3-0 unanimous decision a couple months ago that they had no authority to do what [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=226.58s)]
*  they did. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=232.34s)]
*  And so it's been remanded back to the department. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=233.34s)]
*  We don't know what the next move is. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=236.5s)]
*  But as you said, they fined us $37 million. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=238.02s)]
*  They fined Liberty $17 million. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=241.22000000000003s)]
*  We're the two largest Christian universities in the country. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  And so they're not even being subtle about what they're doing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  The next move, we'll see what their next move is. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=249.5s)]
*  But we're going to have a new administration. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=251.94s)]
*  We're going to have a new secretary of education. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=253.85999999999999s)]
*  And I think what they're going to do is look at these two institutions and say the impact [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=257.98s)]
*  that they're having on the culture because they're teaching from a Christian worldview [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  perspective is immense. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=265.86s)]
*  And they're both growing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=268.34s)]
*  And the demand for what they're doing is tremendous. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=269.74s)]
*  And that is what they're pushing back against. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=272.9s)]
*  And so with all of what's happened in the last six years, it's still a very, very bright [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=275.1s)]
*  future for Grand Canyon University. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=281.02s)]
*  The growth, we can't stop it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=282.98s)]
*  It just keeps coming. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=284.9s)]
*  And that's the positive thing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=286.18s)]
*  That's the... [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=287.86s)]
*  We'll get through this now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=289.18s)]
*  They wouldn't be targeting you, Brian, if you weren't making impact. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=290.18s)]
*  When the dogs bark, it means you're galloping. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=293.1s)]

*  Thank you, Brian. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOzQDKuJno&t=303.14s)]
