# 'PRETTY SICK': AG Pam Bondi teases release of Epstein files
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM)
*  So the Department of Justice is expected to release some of the Jeffrey Epstein files [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=0.0s)]
*  today. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=8.76s)]
*  This comes after a Republican push for transparency. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=9.76s)]
*  Griff Jenkins joins us live from Washington with the details. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=13.16s)]
*  So who's on the list, Griff? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=16.28s)]
*  Boy, Lawrence, that is the question. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=18.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  And there's no timeline, Lawrence, for when this bombshell may drop today. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  But if Pam Bondi's teaser to Jesse last night is any indication, we could get some shocking [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=23.8s)]
*  revelations. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=29.32s)]
*  Two hundred victims, two hundred. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=30.32s)]
*  So we have well over over two hundred and fifty actually. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=34.44s)]
*  So we have to make sure that their identity is protected and their personal information. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=37.72s)]
*  What you're going to see hopefully tomorrow is a lot of flight logs, a lot of names, a [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=44.68s)]
*  lot, a lot of information. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=51.08s)]
*  But it's pretty sick what that man did. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=53.28s)]
*  We call this all started after President Trump first told our own Rachel Campos Duffy that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=57.68s)]
*  he was open to releasing some information. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=62.0s)]
*  Would you declassify the 9-11 files? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=65.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=67.2s)]
*  Would you declassify JFK files? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=68.2s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=70.24s)]
*  I did a lot of it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=71.24s)]
*  Would you declassify the Epstein files? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=72.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I would. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=74.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=76.64s)]
*  I guess I would. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=77.64s)]
*  I think that less so because, you know, you don't know. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=78.64s)]
*  You don't want to affect people's lives if it's phony stuff in there because there's a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=81.2s)]
*  with that whole world. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=84.96s)]
*  But I think I would. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=87.96s)]
*  Then last month, President Trump signing an executive order calling on agencies to release [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=89.72s)]
*  secret documents. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=93.56s)]
*  Well, now, Congresswoman Ana Paulina Luna says she just heard from the DOJ in posting [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=94.56s)]
*  the letter sent from them to X, which reads, in part, the integrity of criminal investigations [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=100.58s)]
*  and prosecutions is essential to every component of the department's mission to uphold the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=106.17999999999999s)]
*  rule of law, keep our nation safe and protect civil rights. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=110.72s)]
*  What's unclear at this point is how this might affect Epstein's co-defendant, Glaine Maxwell, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=114.64s)]
*  who's currently serving 20 years for her role in covering for Epstein. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=120.28s)]
*  Steve? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=123.8s)]
*  We're standing by for it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=125.0s)]
*  All right, Griff, thank you very much. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpagGJYPiM&t=126.0s)]
