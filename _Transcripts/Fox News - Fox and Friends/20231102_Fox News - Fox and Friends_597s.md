# Bahrain says Israeli ambassador has left country after recall
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24)
*  But first let's go to Trey Yanks. He's live on the ground in southern Israel. Trey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, Lawrence, good morning. I'm going to step out of the frame here. I do have some [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  breaking news to discuss, but I want to just show you the scene behind me. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=8.4s)]
*  As we speak, the Israelis are using artillery units to hammer the area along the Israel-Gaza border. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=11.68s)]
*  You can hear it there. This is active fighting that's taking place. They're likely trying to hit [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=19.04s)]
*  some of the tunnel entrances where fighters have been popping out and ambushing troops. But I do [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=23.36s)]
*  want to start with that breaking news. According to reports right now, Bahrain says they have [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=27.84s)]
*  recalled their ambassador to Israel and that the Israeli ambassador has left Bahrain. Manama. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=32.96s)]
*  This is significant. This is just coming in right now. We should talk about this off the top because [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=40.08s)]
*  remember the Abrams Accords that were struck under the Trump administration back in 2020? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=47.2s)]
*  Bilateral ties between Israel and this key Gulf country. Bahrain said it is suspending the economic [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=53.28s)]
*  ties with Israel. So the very basis of what that agreement was built upon is now being suspended [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=60.4s)]
*  as a result of this conflict. It's just yet another indication that the region and the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=66.16s)]
*  communication and relationships that Israel has developed over the past several years are at risk [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=71.6s)]
*  amid this conflict. Now behind me inside the Gaza Strip, the fighting does continue. The Israeli [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=76.16s)]
*  military says 18 of their soldiers have been killed this week in battles with Hamas militants [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=81.04s)]
*  inside the Strip. That number is expected to rise because they understand they are going to take [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  heavy casualties amid these battles. They're using attack helicopters and fighter jets to provide air [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  support to the infantry troops. But it is a challenging push into Gaza City and we do understand [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  that is the final goal in all of this. I do want to take your attention though to the southern [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  Ra'afa crossing between Gaza and Egypt where today for a second day in a row there are foreign [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=105.76s)]
*  citizens getting to cross into Egypt after weeks of being trapped inside Gaza. They are now able [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=111.12s)]
*  to cross. Take a listen to one woman, an American citizen who spoke about her experience while [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=116.48s)]
*  waiting at that crossing. The war just got escalated so fast. A lot of people are dying. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=121.76s)]
*  A lot of people are under the rubbles of buildings. This is my fifth attempt to leave. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  We evacuated our house about 19 days ago. Right now I'm between ice and fire. I don't know if [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=136.0s)]
*  I'm ever going to be able to see the family that I left behind or the friends that I left behind. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  An incredibly difficult time. These people have been waiting inside Gaza trying to get out for [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=150.0s)]
*  weeks since the war erupted following that massacre in southern Israel. We do understand [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=154.96s)]
*  there are Americans among this group and we're working to determine exactly how many [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=159.44000000000003s)]
*  we're able to cross today. Guys? Hey Trey, I was reading that apparently the IDF is now using AI, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=163.44000000000003s)]
*  artificial intelligence, to identify and hit new targets. The breaking news where they are currently [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=172.16000000000003s)]
*  targeting, and I just heard one right there, Gaza sites with artillery. This suggests a different [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=180.72000000000003s)]
*  stage of the war because artillery is not precise. It's not surgical. It's more kind of shooting that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=187.84s)]
*  way. It's a great point and it illustrates just how challenging the fight is for the Israelis [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=195.28s)]
*  because they are dealing with this tunnel network that allows Hamas fighters to pop out and ambush [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  soldiers. It's how many of the 18 soldiers have died from RPGs or anti-tank guided missiles [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=209.12s)]
*  and it hit them unexpectedly and they're trying to operate in this area. But it is an urban [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  battlefield with these tunnels in the different areas. So what we understand is taking place [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=220.72s)]
*  behind us is they're trying to hit those tunnel entrances so they can continue operating in this [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=225.12s)]
*  area. But the enemy that they're up against is an enemy that is not afraid to die. It's an enemy [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=229.6s)]
*  that says they will continue attacks against Jews not just here in Israel but around the world. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=234.72s)]
*  I do want you to listen to Ghazi Hamid, a senior Hamas official who spoke over the past 24 hours [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=239.76s)]
*  about his take on the situation. Take a listen. Israel is a country that has no place on our land. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=245.6s)]
*  We must remove that country because it constitutes a security, military and political catastrophe to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=251.12s)]
*  the Arab and Islamic nation and must be finished. We are not ashamed to say this with full force. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=256.4s)]
*  We must teach Israel a lesson and we will do this again and again. The Al-Aqsa flood is just the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=262.08s)]
*  first time and there will be a second, a third, a fourth because we have the determination, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=267.52s)]
*  the resolve and the capabilities to fight. A few years ago I interviewed Ghazi Hamid in [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  Gaza City and he is considered one of the more moderate members of Hamas if you can believe that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=279.52s)]
*  and he is from their political wing not their military wing and I'm just going to step out of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=286.0s)]
*  the frame here and let my cameraman pan in here because there is significant artillery hitting [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=290.4s)]
*  positions right behind us. You can hear those pops in the distance. That incoming artillery [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=295.52s)]
*  against those positions there again meant to support the infantry troops that we've actually [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=300.96s)]
*  been able to see earlier today. We could see individual soldiers inside the strip operating [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=305.2s)]
*  there but back to Ghazi Hamid, the senior Hamas official, he is considered to be one of the more [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=309.68s)]
*  moderate members of Hamas and he is saying that they are going to try to do this again, kill as [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=314.24s)]
*  many Israelis and Jews around the world as possible. He shows no remorse for the slaughter of civilians [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  in the southern part of this country and he's from their political wing. Guys, this is unbelievable. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=324.96s)]
*  So Trey, I think it's important for people at home to point out and maybe the White House. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=330.23999999999995s)]
*  I watched the whole interview and I've watched the other interview, other members of the, I guess, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=333.84s)]
*  the political wing of Hamas interviewed. They never talk about a two-state solution. I never see a [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  Palestinian say they don't speak for us. They always talk about wiping out Israel, not negotiating [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  with Israel. The days of the 1990 Oslo agreement, those are long gone. You can't, I don't think [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=352.16s)]
*  anybody in the West should be talking two-state solution to at least the other state who wants [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=358.48s)]
*  to enter into that conversation. Have you heard about a two-state solution from Hamas' perspective? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=363.20000000000005s)]
*  No and senior Hamas officials are considered the people who are educated among the organization. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=371.6s)]
*  Some of them that I've met in Gaza City actually received an education at universities in Europe [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=379.44s)]
*  and those are the officials. We're not talking about the militants and the fighters that are [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=385.84s)]
*  fighting from a tunnel network. They're even more extreme but in terms of what this means and how [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=389.84s)]
*  it is playing out around the world, I think it's important to note that there are protesters around [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=396.32s)]
*  the world echoing the sentiments of Hamas officials and they're not calling for a two-state solution [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=400.48s)]
*  and Israelis see that. They've seen the chance in the streets of major cities like New York [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=406.08s)]
*  where people are saying from the river to the sea Palestine will be free. They're talking about the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. In between is the state of Israel and so they are calling for [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=415.52s)]
*  the annihilation of the Jewish state and that's what Hamas is calling for and so I don't know if [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=420.79999999999995s)]
*  those protesters don't understand what they are calling for or if all of them genuinely believe [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  there should be no Israel but it is a dangerous situation because what is playing out here on the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=432.8s)]
*  ground is affecting the entire world. Protesters are taking to the streets and when you talk with [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=438.0s)]
*  American Jews, people we've been talking with getting their take on the situation here, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  they're terrified about what comes next because they see the people that they're living next to, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  their neighbors, their fellow students at university chanting and calling for the destruction of the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=452.48s)]
*  Jewish state. Yeah I mean Trey, I've read a story in the New York Post this morning [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=457.28s)]
*  of how they were killing the babies, putting them in ovens and turning on the ovens and one guy who [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=461.91999999999996s)]
*  is an Israeli, October 7th, was going through and finding exactly finding all this. He said he was [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=468.55999999999995s)]
*  just he lost it for five days. He couldn't you know he was just inconsolable. The stories are [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=474.23999999999995s)]
*  just so graphic. Are they worried when they're on a television station in Lebanon? You can hear [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=480.23999999999995s)]
*  that in the background. When he's on TV in Lebanon and promising to do this a second time, a third [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=487.04s)]
*  time, a fourth time, how are the Israelis, I know you said they're scared, are they going to stay [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=491.36s)]
*  there? Are they going to move to another country? Some people are terrified about what comes next, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=495.44s)]
*  others are just determined to fight and destroy Hamas. What's interesting though is you've seen [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of Israelis from around the world actually come back home and go straight to [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=508.24s)]
*  reserve duty, head straight to their bases to serve their country and fight Hamas. And we should [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=513.2s)]
*  note here the difference between Hamas and the Palestinian people and how complicated Hamas is [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=519.5200000000001s)]
*  creating the situation on the ground. There was a clip and I want to just talk about it because it's [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=524.6400000000001s)]
*  really important. A clip that the BBC aired from inside Gaza of a family member, a woman inside [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=530.32s)]
*  Gaza and she screams out after looking at her dead family member, it's these Hamas dogs that did [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=537.6s)]
*  this because they know the Hamas leadership is not fighting for the Palestinian people, they're [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=543.2s)]
*  fighting for themselves. And unfortunately, the people who are paying the highest price, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=549.2s)]
*  it's the Palestinian people. And there are many peaceful Palestinians. We know them, we have [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=554.4s)]
*  eaten with them, we've been to their homes for dinner during Ramadan and they are horrified about [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  what's taking place. And there's a real understanding, especially in more moderate [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=564.4s)]
*  communities in a place like East Jerusalem where there are Palestinians who will go and work [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=568.24s)]
*  alongside Israelis at factories and at offices. They understand that what Hamas did has set the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  Palestinian cause back decades. Indeed. I love that clip. So we're going to hunt for that because [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=579.12s)]
*  we need to see it. All right. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilme. And I'm Ainsley Earhart. And [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB8EBImLH24&t=585.12s)]
