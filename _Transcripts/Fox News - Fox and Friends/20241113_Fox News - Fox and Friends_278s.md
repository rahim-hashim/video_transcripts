# Kayleigh McEnany: Trump must have his 'eyes wide open' this time
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4)
*  to another alert right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=0.0s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump making his way up to Washington, DC, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=1.28s)]
*  where he's set to meet with President Biden for the first time [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=4.4s)]
*  since the disastrous debate. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Here with what we can expect in this unscripted situation, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=10.0s)]
*  she's co-host of Outnumbered, former White House press secretary. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm pretending like I don't know you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=17.44s)]
*  Kelly McEnany, good to see you again. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=19.56s)]
*  Yes, good to be here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  So your thoughts about what's going to take place, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=21.96s)]
*  where were you with the Obama-Trump transition? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=24.92s)]
*  Oh, I was at CNN, God forbid. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=28.76s)]
*  Like, fighting the good fight, though, to be clear. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=30.96s)]
*  Look, when Obama and Trump met, it was about 90 minutes. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=33.64s)]
*  But if I were Trump, I would walk into this meeting [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=37.28s)]
*  with my eyes wide open. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=40.24s)]
*  Trump, I think, was very gracious to accept the meeting. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=41.28s)]
*  Remember, Biden wanted him prosecuted, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=44.2s)]
*  according to The New York Times, called him a threat to democracy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=46.36s)]
*  But when he met with Obama, Obama warned him about Mike Flynn, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  who then was entrapped by the FBI months later. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=52.44s)]
*  Obama warned him about the threat of North Korea. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=54.92s)]
*  Oh, wait, Donald Trump made amends with North Korea, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=57.0s)]
*  stopped the missile launches, and now what? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=59.32s)]
*  We have North Korean fighters in Ukraine. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=61.24s)]
*  So I think Biden actually has a lot to learn from Trump [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=63.32s)]
*  at this meeting. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=65.56s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=66.16s)]
*  It was gracious for Trump to accept it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  And, Kayleigh, when Donald Trump sat down with Barack Obama [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=68.76s)]
*  back in the day, the one... [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=72.16s)]
*  I remember the one thing he said in public, Barack Obama, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=74.28s)]
*  was the advice to Donald Trump was when he looked at the reporters [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=77.72s)]
*  over there and he said, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=81.72s)]
*  when they start yelling questions, don't answer them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=82.84s)]
*  Of course, Donald Trump immediately broke that, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=86.48s)]
*  and that's why we love to see him do the press conference stuff, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  although you did a really good job, too. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=91.72s)]
*  So it's going to probably be a pretty short meeting [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=93.52s)]
*  because it's not like Donald Trump's got to measure the drapes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=97.36s)]
*  The drapes used to be his. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=100.48s)]
*  He's done the job. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=101.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=103.0s)]
*  He's done the job. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=103.4s)]
*  He's been there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=104.32s)]
*  It could be a quick meeting. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  Biden, look, was very gracious when he gave his remarks. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=107.0s)]
*  And he was the one person who didn't use the word fight. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=109.92s)]
*  He said, let's lower the temperature. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=112.36s)]
*  That was great that he did that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=113.84s)]
*  But again, I would just remind everyone, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=115.6s)]
*  after that meeting with Obama, two months later, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  according to an email we have from Susan Rice, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=119.91999999999999s)]
*  Obama said, don't share intelligence with him [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=122.32s)]
*  because of Russia. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=124.64s)]
*  So again, walk in, be gracious, smile for the cameras, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=125.56s)]
*  and then go be the greatest president ever in the next few years. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=129.32s)]
*  Kayla, what do you think about these New York cases? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  Because it looks like they're going to delay them [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=134.2s)]
*  until after his presidency? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=136.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=137.76s)]
*  Lawfare died. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=138.12s)]
*  Lawfare was rejected by the American people. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=139.56s)]
*  75 million votes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=141.44s)]
*  There's new reporting just this morning [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  that Jack Smith plans to step down from his role. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=144.08s)]
*  That's the right decision. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=146.72s)]
*  Judge Mershon should dismiss this case entirely. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=148.0s)]
*  It should not hang over the head. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=150.52s)]
*  75 million votes. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=152.0s)]
*  Donald Trump won more popular votes by count [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=153.8s)]
*  of any Republican president. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  I think that says what should happen to lawfare. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  Time to move on. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=160.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=161.0s)]
*  And when Brian made a good point at the 6 o'clock hour, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=161.24s)]
*  we're watching Trump's motorcade in Palm Beach [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  head to his plane, flying up to DC. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=166.36s)]
*  And how he must feel. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=169.56s)]
*  Like, I'm going back. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  It's a great moment. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  Vindicated. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=173.24s)]
*  A mandate from the American people. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=174.0s)]
*  Winning among demographics I never thought [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=175.56s)]
*  the Republican Party would. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=177.48s)]
*  And all of those around him. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=178.56s)]
*  Suzy Wiles, Jason Miller, that whole team. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=179.72s)]
*  I mean, you said earlier, they worked really hard. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=182.16s)]
*  They deserve this amazing moment. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=184.2s)]
*  What about press secretary? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=185.72s)]
*  Do you have any idea who he'll choose? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=186.72s)]
*  I mean, I would love Caroline Levitt. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=188.4s)]
*  I'm a little biased because she was my deputy [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=189.96s)]
*  in the White House. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=191.96s)]
*  She knows the job already. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=192.52s)]
*  Nominal. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=193.48s)]
*  She knows the job. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=193.96s)]
*  She's amazing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=195.04s)]
*  She's a fighter. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=195.8s)]
*  She's a professional. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=196.48s)]
*  Her baby's small enough to not really know that her mom is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=197.44s)]
*  really busy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=201.88s)]
*  I had a baby the same age. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=202.6s)]
*  My daughter Blake, she crawled around the West Wing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=205.84s)]
*  But Caroline Levitt is a true professional. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=206.52s)]
*  She'd be the youngest press secretary ever at the age of 27. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=208.52s)]
*  Overall, the pace in which this is being done, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=211.2s)]
*  how are you comfortable with it? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=214.32s)]
*  Do you think this is a good pace? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=215.72s)]
*  It seems like the pace of somebody [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=216.84s)]
*  knows he's got four years, and really maybe two years, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=218.24s)]
*  to get everything going. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=221.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=222.08s)]
*  Look, Trump said, you know, oh, I [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=222.56s)]
*  don't want to talk about cabinet picks before the election. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=224.32s)]
*  He had it in his mind. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=227.2s)]
*  Because it's bad luck. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=228.6s)]
*  It's bad luck. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=230.0s)]
*  But he had it in his mind. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=230.84s)]
*  He knew who he wanted. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=232.16s)]
*  And these are great. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=233.56s)]
*  Since August. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  These are great professionals. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=235.36s)]
*  Foreign policy, it's an indication. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=236.8s)]
*  It's not going the populist route. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=238.36s)]
*  It's going the peace through strength, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=239.8s)]
*  traditional conservative route. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=241.76s)]
*  And that served Trump really well for four years. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NffqEVz62A4&t=243.32s)]
