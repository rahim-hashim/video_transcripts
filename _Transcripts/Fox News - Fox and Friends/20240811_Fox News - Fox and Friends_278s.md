# Steve Martin ‘Walzes’ away from playing Gov. Tim Walz for SNL
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs)
*  All right, well, it's time for another pop culture roundup, and I'm here with Joe Concha [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=0.0s)]
*  to dish out on the latest that Hollywood has to offer. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  So starting off with this, Steve Martin is waltzing away from an offer to play the presumptive [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=12.68s)]
*  VP nominee on Saturday Night Live. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=20.52s)]
*  He told the Los Angeles Times, he told Lorne Michaels, I am not an impressionist, I am [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=23.28s)]
*  not doing that role, you need someone who can really nail this guy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=29.1s)]
*  And he said that he thought he was just being picked because he had gray hair and he kind [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=33.32s)]
*  of had dad vibes. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  But they said no. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=38.58s)]
*  He said no. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=40.02s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=41.02s)]
*  Wasn't he in that movie about the weddings? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=42.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=43.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=44.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=45.02s)]
*  So I guess it kind of makes sense. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=46.02s)]
*  But you got to like Steve Martin because he's a perfectionist. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=47.02s)]
*  If he can't make it 100%. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=50.3s)]
*  That actually looks they actually could. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=53.02s)]
*  He could do that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=55.46s)]
*  Wilford Brimley were still alive. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=56.46s)]
*  That's your guy to play Tim Walz. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=58.300000000000004s)]
*  No question about it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=59.82s)]
*  So who else should do it? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=60.82s)]
*  Oh, at this point with that look, I guess if Bernie Madoff were still alive, that would [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=61.82s)]
*  kind of work. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=66.42s)]
*  Yeah, if Bernie Madoff like. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=67.42s)]
*  Yeah, anybody who's stolen Valor, that would be good because you have somebody who stole [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=68.42s)]
*  the nomination in Kamala Harris. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=71.7s)]
*  Now you have somebody who's stealing Valor with Tim Walz, right? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=72.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=76.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=77.34s)]
*  So that could kind of work. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=78.34s)]
*  And now they're stealing the tips idea. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=79.34s)]
*  Yeah, they're stealing everything. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=80.34s)]
*  Stolen everything. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=82.86s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=83.86s)]
*  He was seen heading to an office in Los Angeles while Jennifer Lopez returns to the West Coast. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=85.46s)]
*  So some are saying they haven't seen each other in weeks. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=90.74s)]
*  This whole breakup. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=92.98s)]
*  It's real. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=93.98s)]
*  It's real. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=94.98s)]
*  And you know what practice makes perfect, Rachel, because when you look at the number [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=95.98s)]
*  of times that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, Jennifer Garner was the ex wife. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=98.46s)]
*  Jennifer Lopez have actually been engaged eight times in their lives, twice seven more [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=102.98s)]
*  times than us and twice to each other. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=108.02s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=109.74s)]
*  Twice. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=110.74s)]
*  And then Ben's then both was engaged to a Jennifer. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=111.74s)]
*  There's a pattern here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=112.98s)]
*  Are you just a little bit sad these guys are breaking out? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=114.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I'm devastated. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=116.38000000000001s)]
*  Me too. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  Actually, I called it on this network when they first got engaged. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  I'm sad. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=121.38000000000001s)]
*  I wanted them to stay together. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=122.38000000000001s)]
*  Oh, you really? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  I like them together. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=124.38000000000001s)]
*  It'll be re-engaged next year. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=125.38000000000001s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=126.38000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=127.38000000000001s)]
*  Well, Gavin Newsom, his office is paying celebrity photographer, get this, Joe. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=128.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=133.1s)]
*  Two hundred thousand dollars a year to take pictures of him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=134.1s)]
*  Now, the latest one we saw was he was doing the homeless encampment and somehow there was [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=137.46s)]
*  photography. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=141.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=142.78s)]
*  Cleaning up homeless encampments never looked so good. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=144.58s)]
*  I'm just saying he looked good cleaning it up. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=146.58s)]
*  Very well dressed. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=149.46s)]
*  But I thought he might be the nominee ultimately. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=150.46s)]
*  He looks kind of sexy there. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  You think so? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=154.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=155.02s)]
*  He's in pretty good shape. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=156.02s)]
*  He's got like a Pete Hedgeskate thing going on. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=157.02s)]
*  You know, there's biceps and the nice triceps and all that fun stuff. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=158.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=161.1s)]
*  I don't even know where to go with this at this point. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=162.1s)]
*  But that's a lot of money. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=164.1s)]
*  It is a lot of money. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=166.38s)]
*  You know what? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=167.38s)]
*  The president of the United States makes what? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=168.38s)]
*  Four hundred thousand dollars a year. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=169.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=170.38s)]
*  The photographer for Gavin Newsom makes two hundred thousand. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=171.38s)]
*  I think he makes more money than any like like most bureaucrats in the California state [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=172.38s)]
*  government. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=177.5s)]
*  So you're probably right. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=178.5s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=179.5s)]
*  So let's move to this because Gen Z thinks relaxation on vacation is overrated. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=180.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=184.82s)]
*  Here's what this new poll reveals that they want to go on vacation and they just want [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=185.82s)]
*  to prioritize making memories, which I think is a euphemism for Instagram photos versus [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=190.66s)]
*  just relaxing on the beach like Joe Biden. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=197.14s)]
*  Where'd you go on spring break? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=199.1s)]
*  Where are you from? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=200.66s)]
*  Arizona State, Mexico. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=201.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=202.66s)]
*  Cancun. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=203.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=204.66s)]
*  Ninety three. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=205.66s)]
*  Boy, I got some stories for you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=206.66s)]
*  The point is when you're that age, you don't want to relax. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=208.26s)]
*  You actually want to exercise in various forms. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=211.58s)]
*  That's that's the way to go. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=213.66s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=215.22s)]

*  I did a lot of this in Cancun. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  But there are no pictures. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=223.98000000000002s)]
*  That's a beautiful thing. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=225.78s)]
*  I got a girl named Muffy, though. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=226.78s)]
*  I got another girl named Muffy. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=229.86s)]
*  Yeah, I swear to God. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=230.86s)]
*  OK, Pete and Will are just rolling over there. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=232.86s)]
*  Listen, you can catch more of Joe without Muffy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=236.86s)]
*  You'll be co-hosting the big weekend show at 7 Eastern tonight. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=242.22s)]
*  You can also pick up a copy of Joe's new book, I Have It. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=246.7s)]
*  It's awesome, progressively worse. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=250.06s)]
*  Why Today's Democrats Ain't Your Daddy's Donkey. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=251.74s)]
*  It's a bestseller. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=255.1s)]
*  It absolutely is. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=256.14s)]
*  Congratulations on the book. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxIHa7OUkYs&t=257.14s)]
