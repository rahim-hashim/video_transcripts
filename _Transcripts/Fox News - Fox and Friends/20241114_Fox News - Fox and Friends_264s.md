# Trump reveals new details about Biden White House meeting: 'Very gracious'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk)
*  So yesterday we saw at 11 o'clock for the president's car roll up on 1600 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=0.0s)]
*  Pennsylvania Avenue and he was greeted by Joe Biden and Jill Biden and they [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=5.44s)]
*  would eventually be seen in the Oval Office as you see shaking hands. They had [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=9.24s)]
*  a couple of words couple lines and then they met instead of an hour it's at 11 [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=13.56s)]
*  to 12 they let for they met for at least two. Here's the exchange. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=18.0s)]
*  Donald, congratulations. Thank you. And looking forward to having a likely said [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=23.44s)]
*  smooth transition. We can make sure you're accommodated what you need. We're [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=29.76s)]
*  gonna get a chance to talk about some of that today. Welcome. Thank you very much. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=35.24s)]
*  And thank you very much. And politics is tough and it's many cases not a very [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=39.44s)]
*  nice world, but it is a nice world today and I appreciate very much a transition [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=46.8s)]
*  that's so smooth. It'll be as smooth as it can get. And I very much appreciate [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  that you're welcome. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=57.32s)]
*  And and that's the way it should work. You know, they they fight like dogs [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=59.44s)]
*  during a campaign, but at the end you come together, you shake hands and say [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=63.12s)]
*  good luck. And essentially that's what has happened because Trump said [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=66.44s)]
*  yesterday the transition team from the Biden White House is really working well [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=69.92s)]
*  with his transition team, so it should be smooth sailing. So we're gonna see as [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=74.64s)]
*  soon as he left, you could probably go now that he's gone, let's trump proof [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=79.92s)]
*  the place. We spent all the green money and get all the money to Ukraine right [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  away. Look, I love the unity. But to your point, Brian, it is really amazing to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=87.6s)]
*  me all that. And I mean, this wasn't the normal campaign rhetoric. You know, it [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  was like it was a lot being said in the campaign to see them grinning together, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=97.96s)]
*  laughing, having a great time, laughing even at the press. I think it was it was [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  a sight to see. Also, apparently, according to the report gave from Jill [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=108.56s)]
*  Biden, she was read by a letter for Melania Trump to give. That's nice. Yeah, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=113.2s)]
*  that is nice. So did you think there's tension there? Well, the Melania's note [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=118.92s)]
*  said, you know, don't trust what you're reading the papers, essentially. So what [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  was she talking about? She could be the harpsichord. She could be referring to the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=127.36s)]
*  harpsichord. It could be. In her book, she didn't talk badly about Jill Biden. In the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=129.6s)]
*  book, she just talked about how tough the transition was with the Obamas [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=133.56s)]
*  because they wanted to get in the White House earlier so that she could see what [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=136.76s)]
*  the veterans look like. She needed to prepare a veteran for her son who was [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=140.12s)]
*  young at the time. And she needed to paint the pink bedrooms for the Obama [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=143.04s)]
*  girls to, you know, something that was more acceptable for Barron's taste. That [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  was really all that she said about. Yeah. Well, blamed about the media a little [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=151.44s)]
*  bit, but not about not about Joe. Well, after the meeting in the Oval Room, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=155.28s)]
*  Donald Trump got on the horn, talked to the New York Post and depicted the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=160.72s)]
*  meeting like this. He said, I asked for his Joe Biden's views and he gave them [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=164.84s)]
*  to me. Also, he talked very much about the Middle East. Likewise, I wanted to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=169.34s)]
*  know his views on where we are and what he thinks. And he gave them to me. He was [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=174.1s)]
*  very gracious. The former president, future president said that Joe Biden [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=179.34s)]
*  will be at his inauguration and they intend to cross trails again before he [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=184.02s)]
*  takes the oath of office. By the way, just look for the crowds. I think that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=189.62s)]
*  the Trump supporters, after all the controversy in 2016, are going to make [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=193.14000000000001s)]
*  this inauguration. Yeah. Biggest crowd. All the buses. Right. I think they're [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=197.46s)]
*  going to like, OK, yeah. Right. And the president will be out there with a tape [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=201.3s)]
*  measure. They have 15 inaugural balls to go to that night. It's a busy night. It'll [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=204.34s)]
*  be fun. I've never been invited to a ball. Is that true? Never. You've never [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  covered them? Never. I never. No, I don't think no one wanted me to cover them or [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=213.86s)]
*  go. They're fun. Right. I'm officially, I'm officially inviting you to the Lone [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=217.5s)]
*  Star Ball. Oh, really? I feel like I need to be there. In D.C. that is one of the best balls. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=224.14s)]
*  Do you have to waltz at a ball? No, but you do need cowboy boots for the Lone Star. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=230.14s)]
*  You should know how to choose that. I'll do that. I got to get them on first. I'm going to grease my ankle. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=234.26s)]
*  You went to Trump's first inauguration. We did. You don't really dance. You can. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=238.26s)]
*  There are people dancing, but you watch them. Yeah. I just probably went to a Friday. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=244.14s)]
*  So no pressure. My plus one was my daughter married. She wanted to go. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNqnOqnHNjk&t=247.66s)]
