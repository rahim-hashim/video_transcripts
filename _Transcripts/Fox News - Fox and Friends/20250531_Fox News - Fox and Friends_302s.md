# WATCH: Biden speaks to press first time since cancer diagnosis
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU)
*  But he so he came out made his first public statements since he was diagnosed with cancer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=0.0s)]
*  and kind of reminding everybody [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=6.96s)]
*  why [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=9.72s)]
*  He was it was why people were questioning his mental capacities in the White House watch [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=11.4s)]
*  There's also been a lot of discussion recently about your mental mental and physical capabilities while you were in office [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=17.76s)]
*  You can see that mentally incompetent [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=24.32s)]
*  Do you want to reply to any of those reports and also to the fact that there are some Democrats who are now [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=30.04s)]
*  Questioning whether you should have run for reelection [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=36.24s)]
*  Many viewers know what he's saying, please email us. There's so much to unpack there. Can we just do this for a second? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=44.4s)]
*  I have no idea what he said. None of the words [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=50.2s)]
*  Like made sense together and then I wish we had the other angle because there's two shots of this and this is this one's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=53.28s)]
*  With him facing forward, but if you see the camera behind him and looking at the reporter [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  He gets in real close like he's gonna sniffer or something and then talker is back [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=66.32s)]
*  He's it's back and then she kind of at the end looks away like I can't believe this just happened to me [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=70.8s)]
*  She's totally creeped out. This is like more proof. I get supposed to be see I'm alive. I'm doing well [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  But it actually is confirmation. Yeah, there's the Fox reporter was not out there. I wonder if that's a coincidence [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=81.72s)]
*  So on the train ride up here [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=89.52s)]
*  Get to the Amtrak get to get to Union Station about ten minutes early as one does and I was like do I get? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=92.68s)]
*  Chick-fil-a do I get on the train? I was like get on the train. Don't want to miss [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=98.08s)]
*  It's walking out to the platform boarding a cello [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=101.84s)]
*  2172 and also about to walk on the platform a couple SUVs come up and I'm like, okay [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=105.2s)]
*  This looks cat in the level obviously President Trump and Vice President Vance are not traveling by Amtrak [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=109.84s)]
*  but I know someone who does and did for a long time and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=114.06s)]
*  All of a sudden there is former President Joe Biden getting on the Amtrak and that changed my whole ride [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=118.72s)]
*  I mean I hadn't shaved in a few days [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=124.92s)]
*  There's way more casual clothes and I was like you spent a fair amount of time covering the White House [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  I was like this vacation reporter. Yeah, three years in, Kentucky for Thanksgiving St. Croix to ring in the New Year twice [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=130.76s)]
*  Lot of weekends at the White House [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=137.2s)]
*  And of course you went to write straight to a reporter mode and this which got [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=140.44s)]
*  Mr. President, how's your health? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  Good how long have you had cancer? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=148.32s)]
*  You did not get an answer to that one they did now when I sat down and I knew he was on the train [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=152.24s)]
*  He was in car five. There was the bar car [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=156.84s)]
*  I was one front and I was like you got to write down, you know, let's go [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=159.14s)]

*  Spoke with no one no one spoke to him. So the president kind of scooped him by talking to the press [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  I thought I was coming up here with some sound reporting some fresh sound [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=171.20000000000002s)]

*  Why is Donald Trump beating you in the latest poll [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=230.78s)]
*  And then the smiles went away after I remember this interview but because it was yelling I never knew it was you [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=236.29999999999998s)]

*  For the mere suggestion that maybe we should be you got nothing on the train [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjfwgP3kPhU&t=272.02s)]
