# This has Iran’s ‘fingerprints’ all over it: Retired US general
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc)
*  You're looking live at destruction in Gaza, where Israel is launching the second phase [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=0.0s)]
*  of its war on Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=4.76s)]
*  The IDF now says at least 450 terror sites and tunnels have been destroyed in Gaza, and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  is warning innocent civilians to get to safety before the attacks ramp up even more. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=13.52s)]
*  Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, retired four-star General Jack Keene joins us now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=18.92s)]
*  General, thanks for being here. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=23.92s)]
*  What do you make of where we are right now? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=26.16s)]
*  General, say there's a second phase. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=28.88s)]
*  You've got the destruction of Hamas. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  You also have hostages. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=33.24s)]
*  What's the consideration right now for the Israeli government as they try to pursue both [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=35.6s)]
*  objectives? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=39.76s)]
*  Yes, yes, certainly, Pete. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=40.76s)]
*  I mean, this operation, characteristically, is very different than the offensive operations [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=43.28s)]
*  that Israel's conducted in Gaza. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=49.26s)]
*  And the reason is because the objective is differently. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  In the past, they wanted to go in and set the Hamas terrorist organization back a number [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=55.92s)]
*  of years, kill as many leaders as they could, certainly fighters as well, and destroy as [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  much military infrastructure as they could. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=67.04s)]
*  So they went in hard and fast and got out in a few weeks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=70.12s)]
*  This mission that's been given to the military is to dismantle the terrorist military and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=75.2s)]
*  terrorist organization and also its political entity. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=81.08s)]
*  So that's very different than what's been assigned in the past. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=84.64s)]
*  So as opposed to hard and fast, this is slow and gradual because of the mission that's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=87.36s)]
*  been assigned. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=93.88s)]
*  So the campaign planning is really quite different. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=94.88s)]
*  There's been extensive bombing here that we've seen now for two plus weeks against actionable [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=98.32s)]
*  targets, certainly. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=105.0s)]
*  And I think they've spent a lot of effort. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=106.0s)]
*  And as you pointed this out and your colleagues in dealing with the tunnel complex and making [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=108.72s)]
*  certain as much of that is destroyed as possible without having to go through civilian infrastructure [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=113.96s)]
*  to destroy it, as you pointed out dealing with the hospital itself and other actionable [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=120.83999999999999s)]
*  targets, certainly as much military infrastructure as they can in that bombing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=125.32s)]
*  And then they started what we in the military call a shaping operation where they conducted [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=131.72s)]
*  raids against actionable targets. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=136.48s)]
*  These were ground assault raids supported by air power when needed, and it was in and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=139.12s)]
*  out. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=144.52s)]
*  But they had targets. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=145.52s)]
*  They knew where they were. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=146.72s)]
*  They had a sense of what that is. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=147.88s)]
*  And then they returned out of Gaza after that was completed. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=149.88s)]
*  And now they've conducted an offensive where their troops are actually staying and it's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  being conducted on multiple axes from the north and from the east. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=159.24s)]
*  And they're going slow systematically for a couple of reasons. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=163.72s)]
*  They want to preserve not taking a lot of casualties themselves, the civilian casualties, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=168.0s)]
*  but the overarching shadow of this operation that is very different and you have mentioned [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=173.8s)]
*  it, are the hostages themselves. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=179.28s)]
*  And that's a critical part of this operation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=182.16s)]
*  And it's actually impacting the tempo of the operation as it unfolds before our eyes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=184.84s)]
*  So you think it's holding back the tempo right now as negotiations are ongoing? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=191.14000000000001s)]
*  Do you think these operations are meant to increase leverage for the hostage situation, General? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=195.72s)]
*  Yeah, certainly. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=202.72s)]
*  But I don't think it, they're going slow so they can understand where, I'm not certain [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=203.72s)]
*  they know exactly where the hostages are. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=210.11999999999998s)]
*  We have no reason to know the actual facts of what's driving it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=212.04s)]
*  Certainly negotiations have taken place. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=216.83999999999997s)]
*  Four have come out. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=219.64s)]
*  They came close, I think, to 50 and that didn't work. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=221.16s)]
*  So that's a factor in what has taken place here. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=224.64s)]
*  They're certainly working on hostage rescue and as complicated that is, but they've got [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  excellent people who know how to do that sort of work. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=233.04s)]
*  All of those are factors in this operation that are taking place. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=236.0s)]
*  But it's very different from the past. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=241.1s)]
*  And I think it really, Pete, it's got Iran's fingerprints over it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=243.32s)]
*  Iran has been in the hostage taking business since the 1980s. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=246.67999999999998s)]
*  It's been a mantra of what they do. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  Hamas never has been, it's not that they haven't done some of it, but it's always [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=253.24s)]
*  been very limited. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=257.64s)]
*  This wholesale taking of hostages over 200 plus, now up to 230 plus, that's Iran's fingerprints. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=258.92s)]
*  And they wanted Hamas to be able to use this as leverage in the operation. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  And certainly that has taken place before our eyes as well. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  That's no doubt, it's completely unprecedented. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=277.32s)]
*  We're almost out of time, General. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  Real quick, you've seen that hospital. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=281.44s)]
*  Eventually, if you want to take the headquarters and you want to destroy Hamas, it's going [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=283.36s)]
*  to have to be Israeli boots dismantling the tunnels underneath that civilian hospital, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=286.68s)]
*  right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=292.36s)]
*  Oh, there's no doubt about it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=293.36s)]
*  For all the command and control and other military infrastructure that exists in the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=295.96s)]
*  city, they will have to put troops in there to deal with most of that that they haven't [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=301.76s)]
*  been able to destroy using their bombing or their artillery. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=305.72s)]
*  And then also, a very difficult challenge for them is they have to separate the terrorists [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=310.04s)]
*  from the people. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=316.04s)]
*  At some point, when the terrorists know that the Israelis are saturating the entire city, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=317.04s)]
*  some of them are no longer going to fight. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=323.72s)]
*  They're going to try to blend into that population. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=325.72s)]
*  But the mission is to dismantle Hamas and not have it come back weeks or months later. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=329.0s)]
*  That will take some time. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's something that U.S. forces have a lot of experience in dealing with in Iraq [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=335.52s)]
*  and Afghanistan. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=340.79999999999995s)]
*  That's a heck of a task. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=341.79999999999995s)]
*  General Jack Keene, thank you very much for your time. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=343.84s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=345.84s)]
*  Yeah, great talking to you. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFTlCGwK2Rc&t=346.84s)]
