# Could we see an AOC 2028 presidential bid?
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k)
*  I mean, there's been some rumors circulating that there's a new name that you could expect [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=0.0s)]
*  over the next four years be running for president in 2028. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=3.72s)]
*  And that is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=7.16s)]
*  There are rumors flying around. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=10.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=11.72s)]
*  She could be a name added to the following expectations for 2028, which would include [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=12.72s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, governor of California, Gretchen Whitmer, governor of Michigan, Josh [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=17.6s)]
*  Shapiro, governor of Pennsylvania, Pete Buttigieg, former secretary of transportation, J.B. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=24.16s)]
*  Pritzker, and then now AOC. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=29.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think, you know, why is everyone going down to Mar-a-Lago? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=32.0s)]
*  Because Donald Trump won the election. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=35.92s)]
*  And in doing so, and Joe Biden, I think he's out, right? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=37.24s)]
*  He's ready to roll. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=41.86s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=42.86s)]
*  He's over it all. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=43.86s)]
*  And so then you say, well, who's leading this party? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=44.86s)]
*  Well, who is leading this party? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=46.96s)]
*  You named off some names that got, a lot of people got excited about. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Someone like Shapiro that comes across as moderate, which isn't. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=51.8s)]
*  But they're governors. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  They're running states. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=56.32000000000001s)]
*  So who at the national level, who is active in the halls of Congress, who's actively fighting [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=57.36s)]
*  against what the Trump administration may do? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=62.4s)]
*  And this name AOC comes up, why? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=65.4s)]
*  Because she's going to be old enough by 2028. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=67.16s)]
*  She's going to be 35 by then. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=70.2s)]
*  She will be. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=71.48s)]
*  Let's see what Monica Crowley has to say about it, and then we'll talk about it on the other [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=72.48s)]
*  end. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  The lesson of this last 2024 election and Donald Trump's landslide mandate victory is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=78.6s)]
*  that the country has had enough of the radical left. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=85.64s)]
*  It's had enough of socialism. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  It's had enough of cancel culture and wokeness, and it rejected roundly all of those things. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=91.24s)]
*  So I don't think in four short years, the country is going to say we need more communism. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=98.1s)]
*  I don't think that that is going to be the choice that they are going to make. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  However, just a word of warning to the Republicans, to my party, do not underestimate AOC. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  She's young, she's vibrant, she's attractive. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=114.72s)]
*  I think she's wrong on everything, but she does have real grassroots support. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=116.8s)]
*  So I really want to focus on that last part of what Monica Crowley said. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=122.64s)]
*  Do not underestimate her. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=127.4s)]
*  I have said this from the moment that woman won that really unlikely election against [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=129.4s)]
*  one of the most powerful Democrats in her district. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=135.28s)]
*  I look at all the people that we have up on the wall, and the one I would fear the most [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=138.24s)]
*  is AOC. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=143.32s)]
*  One of the reasons is, first of all, she is adaptable. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=144.32s)]
*  So as soon as this election happened, she quietly took her pronouns off of her website. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  Then she did this very fascinating Instagram live segment where she said, hey guys, I'm [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=156.84s)]
*  looking at the numbers here. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=165.72s)]
*  There's a lot of people who voted for me and voted for Donald Trump in my district. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=167.24s)]
*  I'm not going to judge you or criticize you. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=171.34s)]
*  I really want to know why you did that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  She wanted to get to the bottom. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  What is it that people find appealing about her that actually translates with Donald Trump? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=179.16s)]
*  We can talk about what that is, but she, among all those people that you see on the wall, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=184.16s)]
*  is the only one who has been actively and I think sincerely and genuinely curious about [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  what just happened. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=194.92s)]
*  That doesn't mean she's not a communist. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  That doesn't mean she's not economically stupid. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  I think she is. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=200.72s)]
*  I think she's done a lot of damage to her district, to the state of New York, all of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=201.8s)]
*  these things. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=206.68s)]
*  But she is a force to be reckoned with. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=207.92s)]
*  She has tens of millions of followers. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=210.4s)]
*  And by the way, the answer to that question is populism. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  She has populist appeal, just like Donald Trump. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=217.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a scenario that exists that she could be a leading voice coming out [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=220.48s)]
*  of it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=225.44s)]
*  I mean, if you go back to 2019, someone asked me, hey, do you think Trump will get reelected? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=226.44s)]
*  I was like, Trump's the only way Trump won't get reelected. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=230.44000000000003s)]
*  The country's doing great. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  Everyone's happy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  They're going to reward that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  And then COVID hits. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  And so what I mean by that is Trump just went on a very populist message, one that reached [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=237.56s)]
*  across the aisle in every category you can think of. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  And she would be going up against that, maybe with a JD Vance, I guess. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=244.0s)]
*  But what happened in 2020 is people, voters on the Democrat side at least, swung towards [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  the establishment because they were scared. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=252.84s)]
*  They were scared from COVID and they wanted, what did they say, return to normalcy was [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=254.4s)]
*  the tagline. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=258.2s)]
*  She doesn't win in that scenario. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=259.56s)]
*  So it depends on how successful this Trump administration is on who can come up from [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=261.32s)]
*  the Democrat side. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=265.44s)]
*  I would not underestimate her, but I would say that right now today, if she went into [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=266.92s)]
*  a debate against JD Vance, I think it mopped the floor with her. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=271.32s)]
*  She is a good communicator, but he is a very intelligent person who is also a good communicator. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=274.36s)]
*  And I'm not attacking her intelligence, but when it comes to issues, especially things [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=278.92s)]
*  like the economy, he has a way of saying things that are really smart and really simple ways. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=282.16s)]
*  And you would expect out of a Trump Vance presidency that's successful, JD is the heir [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=286.92s)]
*  apparent. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=291.76s)]
*  So it depends on who you're going up against. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=292.76s)]
*  It's a lifetime away, 2028, and a lot will change. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=294.32s)]
*  I think I'm with you, Rachel. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=297.32s)]
*  I do think that the left, I think a country just rejected the far left. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=299.0s)]
*  I think that's what just happened. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=304.8s)]
*  And I think she represents the far left. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=306.32s)]
*  And I think the rest of the squad is getting voted out. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=307.6s)]
*  But I also think she's of a different political quality than the rest of the squad. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=309.6s)]
*  And watch what she does over the next four years. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=314.72s)]
*  100%. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQoFTZxT56k&t=316.64s)]
