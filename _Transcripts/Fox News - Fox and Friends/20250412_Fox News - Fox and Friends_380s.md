# Trump signed a lengthy roast list of his Maher insults with ‘good humor'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY)
*  campus. So speaking of free speech and civility, President Trump invited Bill [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=0.0s)]
*  Maher to the White House. Not exactly. Not exactly. Wasn't it that Bob Kid Rock brought him together? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Kid Rock did. But still, I mean, you know, Trump is, if he's always a gracious host. Yes. And he [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=12.96s)]
*  always is so nice to everybody. Like that's kind of his signature, being nice to everybody. Yeah. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=19.92s)]
*  And so he invited Bill Maher to the White House. Bill Maher, of course, agreed to go because he's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=25.6s)]
*  probably never turned down an invitation to anything. I mean, to be fair, would you turn [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=31.28s)]
*  down an invitation to the White House if you were to be? Never. No one would. I would. I would go [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=34.88s)]
*  every time, no matter who the president was. Yeah, but something tells me Bill Maher probably [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=38.08s)]
*  put Kid Rock, his buddy Kid Rock up to this. I think there's probably a good chance of that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=41.04s)]
*  That's a good point. I don't think so. I think that- You think it's totally Kid Rock driven? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  Completely. So one of my favorite moments of Kid Rock on a Bill Maher show was Bill Maher [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=48.64s)]
*  is interviewing Kid Rock and Bill Maher says, will you like Trump? And Kid Rock says, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=54.16s)]
*  that is not true. I do not like Donald Trump. I love Donald Trump. And so they had been having [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=60.08s)]
*  this discussion. He's like, you don't get it. You don't understand how nice he is. And he's like, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=68.08s)]
*  you should meet him. You should meet him. And then this- and then he says, okay, fine. And [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=72.0s)]
*  they called Donald Trump and he gets invited. And this is Bill Maher after the meeting. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=76.72s)]
*  First good sign before I left for the Capitol, I had my staff collect and print out [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=81.36s)]
*  this list of almost 60 different insulting epithets that the president has said about me. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=88.72s)]
*  Things like stupid, dummy, lowlife dummy, sleazebag, sick, sad, stone cold, crazy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=94.72s)]
*  Really a dumb guy, fired like a dog. His show is dead. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=102.56s)]
*  I brought this to the White House because I wanted him to sign it, which he did [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=105.44s)]
*  which he did with good humor. And I know as I say that millions of liberal sphincters just tightened. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=123.68s)]
*  So, you know, I'm like 99% of Americans have never watched this show on HBO, but I bet that is the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  first genuine horse laughs that audience has ever delivered. Yeah, I like Bill Maher's show, but this [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=138.64s)]
*  is the Trump that we have all seen. He actually has a great sense of humor. And that's the thing [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=146.48s)]
*  that I think late night television has missed in destroying itself. Congratulations, Greg Gutfeld, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=151.6s)]
*  the reason you have the huge audience you have is because you're funny. And these guys have become, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=156.72s)]
*  in many ways, political activists with late night humor. But man, if they had leaned into Trump in a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=160.72s)]
*  funny way, he will play it up. He actually has a great sense of humor. And I give credit to Bill [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=167.2s)]
*  Maher, whoever had the idea to print out all the insults, but that is Trump just signing it. And [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=172.48s)]
*  here's the other thing, guys. If Trump could have presented Bill Maher with all the insults that Bill [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=177.2s)]
*  Maher has made about him, and he gets over it, he doesn't hold grudges, which I think is probably [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  the most unique thing about Trump. I mean, heck, he said that President said that he had Hitler [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=188.56s)]
*  tendencies. And now he's a heartbeat away, right? Right. He's willing to forgive most politicians [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=193.52s)]
*  aren't. He actually said to once, if I if I didn't forgive people, I'd have like, something to that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  effect. You know, you're right about that. Yeah. The the last time I saw him, I was like, Oh, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  the left has missed an opportunity in late night TV. But politicians on the left, and even some on [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=212.64s)]
*  the right, are missing the opportunity to learn. This is how politics is done. Be real. I mean, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=218.32s)]
*  that's one of the things that Bill that Bill Maher talked about a lot in his sort of post recap of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=224.72s)]
*  this meeting was the guy is very real. He said, I've been around Democrats, I agree with them in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=229.76s)]
*  politics. And they are much harder to talk to. They don't they look away. They're not really [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=235.76s)]
*  interested in what I have to say. I felt like Donald Trump was a real person. I could disagree [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=240.72s)]
*  with them. I can look them in the eye. We could have a real discussion. Here's another bit of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=245.6s)]
*  Bill Maher sharing his experience from meeting Donald Trump at the White House. When I got there, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=250.4s)]
*  that guy wasn't living there. Now, does Trump want respect? Of course, who doesn't? My friend said [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=256.88s)]
*  to me, What are you going to wear to the White House? I said, I don't know, but I'm not going to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=262.56s)]
*  dress like Zelensky. I'll tell you that. He's much more self aware than he lets on in public. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=266.0s)]
*  Look, I get it. It doesn't matter who he is at a private dinner with a comedian. It matters who [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=273.52s)]
*  he is on the world stage. I'm just taking as a positive that this person exists, because everything [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=279.28s)]
*  I've ever not liked about him was, I swear to God, absent, at least on this night with this guy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=285.84s)]
*  I never felt I had to walk on eggshells around him. And honestly, I voted for Clinton and Obama, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=292.48s)]
*  but I would never feel comfortable talking to them the way I was able to talk with Donald Trump. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=298.48s)]
*  That's just how it went down. Make of it what you will. Me, I feel it's emblematic of why the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=303.36s)]
*  Democrats are so unpopular these days. It is. And it's also emblematic of the kind of deals he's [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=308.64s)]
*  making right now. He gets on the phone with people. He knows how to connect. His, you know, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=314.88s)]
*  social intelligence, to me, is off the charts. I think that's true, Rachel. And also, authenticity [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=320.48s)]
*  destroys cancel culture. People have gotten used to who Trump is. And I think what Bill Marsh saw [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  is what the American public as a whole has come to see. You don't have to agree with the guy on [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=332.96s)]
*  everything, but he's not pretending to be something that he isn't. And that's what stood out to me. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  A lot of politicians, Obama, Hillary Clinton, actually pretend to be something they aren't. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=342.48s)]
*  Remember, why did Bill Clinton get away with having an affair with an intern in the Oval Office? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=348.56s)]
*  Because deep down, people were like, I can kind of see him doing that. Right? I mean, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=353.2s)]
*  it's not a good authenticity, but he was representative of what people thought. And [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=357.04s)]
*  I love this because it's destroying cancel culture. And Trump listens because he is [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=361.92s)]
*  interested in people. That's right. Which is a huge difference. Very true. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EwqzHsSEZY&t=366.72s)]
