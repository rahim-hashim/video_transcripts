# Are medical flights riskier? Air safety expert weighs in
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=0.0s)]
*  First responders on the scene after a medical jet goes down in a fiery explosion in Philadelphia. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=2.52s)]
*  As investigators try to determine the cause of the devastating crash, our next guest knows [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=8.28s)]
*  the owner of the air ambulance company whose Lyrejet crashed and has first-hand knowledge [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=13.44s)]
*  on the inner workings of these types of planes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=19.8s)]
*  AirCare One Air Ambulance Flight Coordinator Director Alex Quintana joins us now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=22.6s)]
*  Alex, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=30.52s)]
*  There have been a lot of speculation, as you would understand. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=31.52s)]
*  The videos are pretty graphic. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=35.4s)]
*  This thing comes down so fast, a fiery ball of explosion, and we've lost life through [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=36.64s)]
*  this. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=41.08s)]
*  But people are starting to speculate. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=42.08s)]
*  What could have caused it? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=44.0s)]
*  What could happen? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=45.0s)]
*  And it's great to get your perspective on a look inside one of these jets and what kind [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=46.0s)]
*  of devices or capabilities are in there and what makes them different. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  And I'd love for you to kind of explain that to us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  Sure, absolutely. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=57.72s)]
*  So these aircraft are essentially flying ICUs. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=59.36s)]
*  So they're equipped with a stretcher. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=63.02s)]
*  There is oxygen on board, any host of medical equipment and medications to keep the patients [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=64.62s)]
*  comfortable and safe. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=71.56s)]
*  So looking at the interior of the jet, you can see the stretcher goes on there and we [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=73.36s)]
*  can accommodate the medical crews and usually passengers and always staff with a set of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=77.08s)]
*  two pilots in these cases. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=84.36s)]
*  When you train to work on one of these, are you made aware of anything that is more hazardous? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=87.8s)]
*  Stay away from that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=94.28s)]
*  Don't press the red button kind of thing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=95.28s)]
*  Don't do this with oxygen. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=97.16s)]
*  Is there anything that sticks out to you that you're trained to say, hey, this could be [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=98.8s)]
*  very dangerous. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=103.48s)]
*  Don't mix these two things, anything like that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=105.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=107.76s)]
*  So in our operation, training, practice, and safety management are sort of the key hallmarks [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=108.76s)]
*  of any legitimately operating program. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  So we do training on a regular basis, quarterly trainings. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=121.44s)]
*  We train for these types of scenarios so that we know how to react, who we know how to operate [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=126.08s)]
*  and who to communicate with in these types of situations. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=132.28s)]
*  So training and safety management are probably the top things that we do to make sure that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=135.56s)]
*  we are operating safely and correctly. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=141.76s)]
*  I have a family member that does live flight on helicopters. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=145.16s)]
*  When you're applying for a job like this to work on one of these jets, is it considered [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=148.72s)]
*  a particularly dangerous job or no more than anyone else that flies for a living? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=152.84s)]
*  The industry overall is very safe. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  These accidents happen not too frequently. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=161.4s)]
*  There are a lot of external factors that go into any sort of flight operation. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=165.32s)]
*  Just with aviation, overall, it's extremely safe. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=170.29999999999998s)]
*  So people are aware of the risks that come with any sort of operation. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=173.56s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=177.64s)]
*  Thanks for bringing some insight. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=179.84s)]
*  I think right now we have so many questions. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=181.2s)]
*  Our hearts are broken and we hope we get those answers soon. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=184.04s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=187.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=188.72s)]
*  I appreciate your time. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsRnKP2K-s&t=189.72s)]
