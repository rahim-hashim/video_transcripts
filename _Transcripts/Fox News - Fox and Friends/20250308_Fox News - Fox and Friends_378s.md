# DHS identifies ICE raid leakers, Sen. Rick Scott calls for action
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI)
*  Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem exclusively telling Fox News she is taking action after identifying two internal leakers within the agency. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=0.0s)]
*  We have identified two leakers of information here at the Department of Homeland Security who have been telling individuals about our operations and putting law enforcement lives in jeopardy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=10.0s)]
*  We plan to prosecute these two individuals and hold them accountable for what they've done. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=22.0s)]
*  And we're going to continue to do all that we can to keep America safe. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=27.0s)]
*  Florida Senator and member of the Homeland Security Committee Rick Scott joins us now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=30.0s)]
*  Senator Scott, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=36.0s)]
*  How important is it that DHS go after and other agencies for that matter go after these leakers inside federal government agencies that are undermining the administration's effort to make arrests and deport criminal aliens? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=38.0s)]
*  It's very important. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=56.0s)]
*  Number one, Trump 47 is going to be known for three things. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=59.0s)]
*  Common sense, accountability and transparency. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=62.0s)]
*  And so what Kristi Noem is doing here is saying who in the right mind wants to keep criminals in this country and why would somebody at Homeland Security want to help criminals that are killing American citizens? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=67.0s)]
*  We just watched Laken Riley's parents the other day. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=81.0s)]
*  Who in the right mind? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=85.0s)]
*  So she's going to hold people accountable. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=86.0s)]
*  I've been in the Senate six years. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=88.0s)]
*  There has been no accountability. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=89.0s)]
*  This is what's going to happen now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=92.0s)]
*  There's going to be accountability all across this country. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=93.0s)]
*  If you're illegal, you cannot you're not you don't have a right to be in this country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=96.0s)]
*  You know, you don't have a right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=101.0s)]
*  Come in here legally. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=102.0s)]
*  I like legal immigration. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=104.0s)]
*  If we need to work on our legal immigration system, the Democrats should help us. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=106.0s)]
*  But this idea that we want criminals and terrorists and narco traffickers, we want more drugs and these Democrats want to defend it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=109.0s)]
*  The Democrats are being known for exactly what the American public don't want. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=116.0s)]
*  The American public want transparency and accountability. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=121.0s)]
*  And of course, if you're an employee working for the federal government, working for the executive branch and you're thwarting the efforts of the executive branch, you probably should no longer be working for the federal government. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=124.0s)]
*  But it's funny, we're in this upside down world where you have people behaving like this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=135.0s)]
*  You have Democrats today who are weighing the idea of a government shutdown in order to protest the cuts being made by Doge. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=140.0s)]
*  I mean, talk about lost in the wilderness. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=152.0s)]
*  They are lost. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=157.0s)]
*  You know, everybody comes into my office every week and ask for more money. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=159.0s)]
*  And here's what I explained to them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=162.0s)]
*  We've had a 2% increase in population the last five years and a 53% increase in spending. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=164.0s)]
*  We are spending $2 trillion more than we take in. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=170.0s)]
*  Inflation will not go away. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=173.0s)]
*  Interest rates will not come down until we balance our budget. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=176.0s)]
*  And there is so much waste. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=180.0s)]
*  Thank God for what Elon Musk and his team are doing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=182.0s)]
*  They're showing this massive, just complete waste and exactly what the American public has seen. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=184.0s)]
*  And the average person says, don't spend my money like this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=192.0s)]
*  I would not spend my money like this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=198.0s)]
*  We had a hearing the other day and I asked two people that are supportive of foreign aid. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=200.0s)]
*  I said, okay, so I have to go back to Florida and explain, what does a citizen of Florida get for this foreign aid? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=204.0s)]
*  They couldn't do it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=211.0s)]
*  They could not explain what an American citizen gets out of this foreign aid. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=212.0s)]
*  I'm sure there's something that's good that's there, but they couldn't explain it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=216.0s)]
*  That's exactly the problem we've got. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=220.0s)]
*  Our government is unexplainable now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=222.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=224.0s)]
*  So obviously, you know, people are applauding what they're seeing out of the executive branch, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=225.0s)]
*  but there's still a lot that the legislative branch can do from your end. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=229.0s)]
*  What are some of the things that you're looking at from a congressional standpoint to buttress these cuts and make them permanent? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=234.0s)]
*  Well, number one, we've got to balance the budget. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=244.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=247.0s)]
*  Number two is everything that Elon Musk and his team are finding and agency heads are finding, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=248.0s)]
*  we've got to take a rescission package from the White House and we've got to pass it to eliminate the spending. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=253.0s)]
*  So we've got the opportunity this coming week, this coming week, either we, if we don't come up with a continuing resolution, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=258.0s)]
*  then we're going to have government shut down on Friday. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=267.0s)]
*  I know the Democrats, many Democrats are saying they want government shut down. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=270.0s)]
*  I don't want government shut down. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=273.0s)]
*  I want accountability. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=274.0s)]
*  I want a balanced budget. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=275.0s)]
*  Well, I balanced a budget in Florida. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=277.0s)]
*  Florida had not balanced its budgets. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=279.0s)]
*  Most states don't balance the budget. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=280.0s)]
*  They just keep borrowing money like the federal government. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=281.0s)]
*  I balanced it every year by doing exactly what Elon Musk is doing. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=283.0s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=287.0s)]
*  We went line by line like you probably do with your credit card. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=288.0s)]
*  You look through there and say, hey, I didn't spend, I didn't spend this. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=290.0s)]
*  And every family in America does. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=294.0s)]
*  I didn't buy this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=296.0s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=297.0s)]
*  So everybody does it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=298.0s)]
*  And I want to get to this one final thing with you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=300.0s)]
*  I know that you're on the cutting edge of wanting to lock the clocks and end [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=303.0s)]
*  daylight savings time forever. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=307.0s)]
*  So why do we need to lock the clocks and end daylight savings time? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=310.0s)]
*  Well, first off in Florida, we like our sunshine. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=318.0s)]
*  We love being out on the beach. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=320.0s)]
*  We love being playing sports. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=322.0s)]
*  We love all these things. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=324.0s)]
*  And people are just sick and tired of going back and forth twice a year. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=325.0s)]
*  You change the clock. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=329.0s)]
*  So they're tired of it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=331.0s)]
*  When I was governor, I passed a bill that if the federal government allowed us, we were [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=332.0s)]
*  going to stay on daylight savings time. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=336.0s)]
*  I have a federal bill, Sunshine Protection Act, which they will stay on daylight savings [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=338.0s)]
*  time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=342.0s)]
*  President Trump has been supportive of locking the clock and I hope we can get it done quickly. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=343.0s)]
*  So we stopped this going back, constantly going back and forth every few months. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=347.0s)]
*  Although he kind of punted the other day when he said, I don't know, it's a 50-50 issue. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=352.0s)]
*  And I think he's really gotten so used to his 80-20 issues that a 50-50 issue doesn't [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=358.0s)]
*  even get him out of bed in the morning. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=363.0s)]
*  But thank you so much, Senator Rick Scott, for joining us. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_rc-STCbjI&t=365.0s)]
