# BREAKING: FBI hunts for man who appeared to shoot at ICE agents
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI)
*  We'll start with this Fox News alert. The FBI is offering a big reward for information [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=0.0s)]
*  regarding a protester who appeared to fire a gun at federal agents during a California [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=6.36s)]
*  immigration raid yesterday. Jackie Heiner joins us live from the White House. Good morning, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=11.42s)]
*  Jackie. Good morning to you guys. The FBI is offering 50 grand to anyone who helps them [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  identify and convict a protester who allegedly fired a gun at federal immigration officers. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=21.48s)]
*  That moment was captured by local news cameras. Federal immigration officers were carrying [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=27.38s)]
*  out a raid with a search warrant at a Southern California marijuana facility. Hundreds of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  protesters swarmed that area despite warnings from the U.S. attorney who told them not to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=37.34s)]
*  interfere or they'd be charged with a federal offense. There were no reports of any injuries, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=41.98s)]
*  but the video appears to show that man shooting a pistol at law enforcement agents. California [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=46.54s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom tried to politicize the moment, posting kids running from tear [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=51.9s)]
*  gas, crying on the phone because their mother was just taken from the fields. Trump calls [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=56.5s)]
*  me news scum, but he's the real scum. The CBP commissioner, Rodney Scott, replied to [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=60.62s)]
*  that, saying, here's some breaking news. Ten juveniles were found at this marijuana facility, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  all illegal aliens, eight of them unaccompanied. It's now under investigation for child labor [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=71.38s)]
*  violations. This is Newsom's California. Authorities are sounding the alarm that escalating anti-ice [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  rhetoric could carry deadly consequences. But California Democratic Senator Alex Padilla [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=82.38s)]
*  is defending his proposal that would mandate ICE wear visible identification and ban them [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=87.5s)]
*  from concealing their faces during most operations, posting to X, in a democracy, no one should [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=92.88s)]
*  have to guess if they're being handcuffed by real law enforcement or armed imposters. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=98.36s)]
*  My bill defends against unchecked power and unconstitutional overreach. Acting ICE director [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=103.24s)]
*  Todd Lyons tells Fox he doesn't love the masks, but they're necessary right now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=109.78s)]
*  If you looked at the beginning of this administration, you looked even December, November of last [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=114.46000000000001s)]
*  year, we weren't wearing masks. ICE agents weren't wearing masks because they weren't [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=118.22s)]
*  afraid of their information being docked, their photos taken, addresses posted. While [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=121.34s)]
*  I'm not a fan of the masks, I think we could do better, but we need to protect our agents [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=125.86s)]
*  and officers and I fully support them in that. DHS says ICE agents have faced a near 700% [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=131.14s)]
*  increase in assaults recently. Griff. All right, Jackie, thank you very much. And let's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=137.54s)]
*  just put this in perspective for our viewers. The first 10 days of July have been an absolutely [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=142.78s)]
*  unprecedented assault on federal immigration officers in a way we've never really seen [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=148.78s)]
*  before. As we know, those assaults are up 700%. Let's start on July 1st, Matthew White, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=154.73999999999998s)]
*  an individual in Buffalo arrested and charged with threatening to kill an ICE officer riding [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=161.1s)]
*  on social media, killed them all. ICE is a new age Gestapo. Get us to July 4th in Alvarado, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=166.54s)]
*  Texas, 10 individuals facing first degree murder charges of a federal immigration officer [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=173.54s)]
*  while one, an 11th individual, is on the run. A manhunt is out for him, a $25,000 reward [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=179.82s)]
*  because that attack involved AR style rifles, body armor, and two-way radios. An officer [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=187.34s)]
*  was shot in the neck recovering thankfully. You've got Monday, July 7th down in McAllen, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=193.1s)]
*  Texas, a Border Patrol annex, an individual, a barrage of bullets fired from an AR style [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  rifle. Border Patrol fortunately able to neutralize that and kill the individual but raising security [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=203.72s)]
*  concerns at all Texas Border Patrol facilities. July 8th, the next day, Senate Democrats don't [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=209.42s)]
*  read the room on the threats to federal immigration officers and you have Senator Cory Booker [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=215.74s)]
*  and Alex Padilla dropping legislation to force ICE agents to take their masks off, putting [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=220.26s)]
*  them and their families at greater risk of being doxed. Same day, four arrested in Van [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  Isle, California, literally putting tire spikes down to disable ICE vehicles because they [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=231.38s)]
*  oppose a lawful federal immigration operation. Also on the same day in San Francisco, you've [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=238.02s)]
*  got protesters violently confronting ICE officials and officers trying to take into custody [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=245.66s)]
*  the criminal illegal aliens that had been marked for deportation just carrying out the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=252.66000000000003s)]
*  laws Washington passed but yet they violently are getting in the way. And then of course [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=257.98s)]
*  what we've all been watching all morning long out in Camarillo, California, a major raid. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=263.1s)]
*  And taking what you just walked us through and especially looking at potential labor, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=299.22s)]
*  you know what they did with these children, the eight unaccompanied minors, the ten children [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=305.46000000000004s)]
*  that were found on this marijuana farm and conclude that law enforcement is the problem, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=308.78000000000003s)]
*  that ICE is the problem in this country or ICE agents are hero as are all law enforcement [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=314.0s)]
*  officers. Just recently they nabbed an MS-13 Kingpin who was wanted for five murders in [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  El Salvador and on its top 100 most wanted list you had Attorney General Pam Bondi at [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=325.58s)]
*  the end of last month announced that federal authorities had arrested 2700 Trende O'Agua [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=331.3s)]
*  gang members. I'm sorry, the people who are out there arresting and deporting those people, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=336.94s)]
*  they are the heroes, not the villains, yet the Democrats see them as the villains, not [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=341.14s)]
*  the heroes. And border czar Tom Homan was with us the last hour and he talked about [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  minors found at the weed farm. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=351.34s)]
*  Certainly upsets me. Like I said, the work men and women of ICE are doing is incredible. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=353.7s)]
*  Look, we're looking for over 300,000 missing children. We've already found 10,000. Have [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=361.78s)]
*  you heard that anywhere? No, the media is simply not covering it. And look, this should [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=366.34s)]
*  be a nonpartisan issue. Arresting public safety threats and national security threats, everybody [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=370.58s)]
*  should be on the same page on that. Rescuing children, it should be a nonpartisan issue. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=376.82s)]
*  Everybody should be in lockstep on that. But they're not. The media is lying. The Democrats, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=382.18s)]
*  they don't want President Trump to be successful. I got news for them. We are being successful. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=387.65999999999997s)]
*  Every illegal, alien, public safety threat we arrest makes this country safer. Every [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=392.74s)]
*  national security threat we take off the street and deport makes us safer. And we're rescuing [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=396.84s)]
*  The lives saved every day by ICE, the lives saved every day by board patrol are in the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=402.86s)]
*  hundreds. So the only thing I can think of, Griff, is if they hate President Trump more [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=408.66s)]
*  than they love their community. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=414.82s)]
*  So you're talking about a situation where you have these ICE officials trying to solve [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=416.94s)]
*  a human catastrophe that was entirely caused by Democrat politicians over the past four [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=421.98s)]
*  or five years. You have an investigation into child slavery. And then you have actual, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=427.82s)]
*  as you went through, violence being committed against officers who are sworn to uphold [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=435.26s)]
*  the law and enforce the laws, including ICE agents being fired at. And you have Gavin [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=442.26s)]
*  Newsom, the governor of California, who many Democrats view as the top person who could [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=448.1s)]
*  potentially run against, you know, get the party's nomination in 2028, condemning the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=454.73999999999995s)]
*  officers and condemning those trying to enforce the law. That's the situation where, you know, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=462.5s)]
*  the rest of the country has moved on to trying to enforce the law. But that's where the Democrat [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=468.7s)]
*  party is stuck. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=473.34s)]
*  And you can't underscore the part about where Tom Hohn was talking about rescuing these [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=474.46s)]
*  children. Gavin Newsom and all the Democrats need to remember, we can show you back a couple [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=479.42s)]
*  years ago in McAllen, by the way, the same city where we had that attack on the Border [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=485.42s)]
*  Patrol, these children that were trafficked across the border unaccompanied. You can see [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=489.82s)]
*  here, I'm with Texas DPS. That boy was six years old with nothing but a little card around [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=497.02s)]
*  his neck with a name and a phone number of someone to contact. He was literally, we found [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=503.58000000000004s)]
*  him in the early hours just walking across terrified. You know, the rescue of the eight [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=509.98s)]
*  unaccompanied minors in Camarillo, California, these are the most vulnerable individuals [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=517.14s)]
*  that were caught up in a chaos of the Biden administration and now out there, how many [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=523.98s)]
*  more are out there as ICE trans-period? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=530.98s)]
*  It's not about the kids. It's about protecting criminals. That's what the Democrat party [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=533.54s)]
*  is about. I mean, that's just, that's exactly what's happening. That's what it's about. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=537.14s)]
*  It's about protecting criminals. It's about going to El Salvador for people like Kilmore [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=541.98s)]
*  Abrego Garcia and for shielding Tren de Orogua, not about protecting American citizens. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=546.42s)]
*  It's all about them maintaining their power. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=552.6999999999999s)]
*  And most compelling analysis. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVBRqIEbDAI&t=563.14s)]
