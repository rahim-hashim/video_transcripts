# White House weighs welcoming Palestinian refugees: Report
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y)
*  Alright, 12 minutes before the top of the hour, back with the Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Multiple fights broke out overnight on the campus out west in LA at UCLA during a standoff [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=4.36s)]
*  between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian protesters. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=9.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, in our nation's capital, the White House is denouncing the takeover of campus [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=13.16s)]
*  buildings by pro-Palestinian protesters. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson is live in DC with those details. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=21.84s)]
*  Lucas? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=25.76s)]
*  That's right, Steve. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=26.76s)]
*  We see White House's deputy press secretary's name on that statement condemning the violence, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=27.76s)]
*  not President Biden's, calling the hijacking of that building at Columbia not peaceful. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=31.92s)]
*  Now, overnight, riot police arrived at UCLA yesterday. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  There was no on-camera White House press briefing, but we did hear from John Kirby. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  The president believes that forcibly taking over a building on campus is absolutely the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=45.28s)]
*  wrong approach. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=50.42s)]
*  That is not an example of peaceful protest. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=51.52s)]
*  And of course, as you rightly noted, hate speech and hate symbols also have no place [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=55.52s)]
*  in this country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=61.52s)]
*  Yesterday, Biden spoke at a campaign event at a high school in Delaware. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  No press was allowed inside. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=66.88s)]
*  And now CBS reporting, quote, top U.S. officials have also discussed getting additional Palestinians [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=68.74s)]
*  out of Gaza and processing them as refugees if they have American relatives. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=74.72s)]
*  Our own Aisha Hosni caught up with Biden's education secretary yesterday on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=79.92s)]
*  Secretary, do you condemn the anti-Semitism that's happening on these college campuses [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=84.36s)]
*  right now? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=91.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=92.36s)]
*  And are you going to get involved in trying to stop some of these camps and folks that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=93.36s)]
*  are protesting? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=97.44s)]
*  The violence overnight taking place on May Day, which is rooted in Marxist ideology. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=100.0s)]
*  Steve? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=104.4s)]
*  It is indeed. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=105.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=106.4s)]
*  Thank you very much, Lucas. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=107.4s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=108.4s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=109.4s)]
*  And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqFRStMv6Y&t=110.4s)]
