# Today's Top Headlines | Wednesday, Nov. 22
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU)
*  We begin this hour with a Fox News alert right now smoke rising over Gaza just hours after the Israeli cabinet [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=0.0s)]
*  Approved a limited four-day ceasefire with Hamas the pause and fighting will take effect sometime in the next 24 hours [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=7.2s)]
*  So this is what we know under the deal [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=14.4s)]
*  150 Palestinian prisoners will be handed over in exchange for 50 hostages taken by the terrorist group Brian [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=17.36s)]
*  All right, here we go. That includes a three-year-old American girl whose parents were killed on October 7th [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=24.16s)]
*  We think her name is Abigail Jeff Paul joins us right now from Tel Aviv. Hey Jeff [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=29.72s)]
*  You have weeks of tense negotiations finally with some results here in Tel Aviv this meeting with Israeli government officials where they debated [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=37.76s)]
*  Whether or not to approve this deal. It took more than six hours [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=46.08s)]
*  They ended around 3 3 30 in the morning here local time [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=49.32s)]
*  But under this agreement you're gonna have not only a pause in the fighting but this release of hostages [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=52.739999999999995s)]
*  Which you got to think about for all the families of the hostages [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=58.42s)]
*  It gives them a bit of hope that there is some good news on the horizon now under this broker deal that involve the US [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=61.7s)]
*  Qatar's and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=69.34s)]
*  Egyptians [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=70.98s)]
*  Israel will get 50 hostages released to them from Hamas [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=71.98s)]
*  These will be women and children in exchange Israel will release [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=75.44s)]
*  150 Palestinian prisoners the hostages as we understand will be released in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=79.38s)]
*  Groups of about 10 to 12 over a span of four to five days each of those days when hostages are released [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=84.34s)]
*  There'll be a pause in the fighting now Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been under increasing pressure [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  From the families of the hostages. He said this was a tough decision, but he believes it was the right decision [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=95.7s)]
*  But he also added their campaign to crack Hamas will continue [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  And I grew the milk on up we are at war and we will continue this war until we achieve all our goals [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=107.3s)]
*  To eliminate Hamas to bring back all of our hostages and missing people and to ensure that in Gaza [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=113.98s)]
*  There will be no factor that threatens Israel [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=120.94s)]
*  Hamas released a statement regarding the agreement saying in part we affirm that our fingers remain on the trigger and our victorious [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=126.66s)]
*  Finders will remain on the lookout to defend our people and defeat the occupation [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=134.32s)]
*  Now again, we could see that first batch of hostages released as soon as tomorrow [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=139.34s)]
*  We're hearing the ceasefire could start at 10 a.m. Local time [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=144.46s)]
*  So that that is good news and in past hostage releases [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=149.02s)]
*  We've seen the hostages taken to the rapid crossing they get into Egypt and then they're chopper back here to somewhere in Israel [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=153.62s)]
*  They're gonna go to the hospital get checked out and eventually they'll be talking to Israeli security about the things they saw and the things they [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=160.34s)]
*  Experienced send it back to you all. Yeah to get the rest of them out. Let's hope Jeff. Thanks so much [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=167.24s)]
*  That would be a rescue rather than a release. Let's bring in beside veteran Odette Ilam. He's live from Tel Aviv [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=172.08s)]
*  Odette thanks for joining us. Is this a deal you would do? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=178.08s)]
*  Thanks for having me first of all and I wouldn't call it a deal but it's more of sort of a blackmail [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  but under the circumstances [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  Morality overrides the objections of the war [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=195.0s)]
*  Which is to eradicate the Hamas [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=201.44s)]
*  so this is more or less the same deal that was on the table in the beginning of the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=205.04s)]
*  invasion into Gaza with a few changes and a little bit flexibility of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=213.92s)]
*  both sides, but it's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  Basically, it's more or less the same deal [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=222.0s)]
*  It's just worth pointing out that there's an explosion on the right. It looks like so [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=225.6s)]
*  Which goes to my next point of dead? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=230.24s)]
*  Sinwar is on the ropes right now. We know Israeli special forces that been hitting him hard [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=233.32s)]
*  Plus you got your infantrymen the the ground game as well as the air support [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=239.88s)]
*  So the question is that they come to the negotiation table because they're fractured and they need some time to regroup [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=244.84s)]
*  Absolutely [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=251.96s)]
*  This is this is exactly [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=254.6s)]
*  The point right now the Hamas right now is as you said is is on the rope, but it's not [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=257.04s)]
*  It does not feel that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=264.8s)]
*  It's going to be [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  Eradicated not now. We need to use much more force in order to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=270.32s)]
*  To [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  Convince him that this is its last chance and then maybe in the future the near future [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=278.44s)]
*  We can get a better deal. Oh [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=285.72s)]
*  Dead in the original reporting before the Israeli government and then Hamas agreed to this [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=288.56s)]
*  Hostage negotiation you called it blackmail and I understand why you say that the original [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=295.04s)]
*  Reporting was that Iran would have to agree not to use drone surveillance over Gaza [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=299.72s)]
*  Do you know if that is included in the final deal? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  It's difficult to say what is included in the final deal or not, but I think eventually the next few hours [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=309.44s)]
*  We will all know what is included in the final deals right now [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=316.44s)]
*  It seems that this is included in the final deal, which actually [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  It's hinders [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=326.48s)]
*  Israeli efforts to gather intelligence on the ground you must understand that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  The [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=333.76s)]
*  most fundamental [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=335.32s)]
*  Intelligence that being gathered is is on the ground is by troops. It's by drones. It's by [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=337.16s)]
*  documents and whatever you have [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=345.68s)]
*  access to so this [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=349.32s)]
*  Hinders in a way our ability to see how the Hamas is going to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=353.36s)]
*  regain its force and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=360.04s)]
*  Change its position and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  Even a reach a more hostages Oh dead. So right now they've been in there for about three weeks inside [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  They're able to go into a lot. I understand one of the big stories yesterday [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=371.8s)]
*  They went into a mosque and saw a whole weapons depot and weapons plant inside a mosque [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=374.8s)]
*  So they have information on the ground to see I evidently our special forces also on the ground [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  How much information and intelligence can we get if there is a drone which they're all undetectable by the eye? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=384.64000000000004s)]
*  Above to see where these hostages emerge. How valuable is that? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=391.48s)]
*  Enormous [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  Because the right now the Hamas will use the pose and I call it the pose for few purposes [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=400.68s)]
*  first of all [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=407.04s)]
*  to regain supply [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=408.56s)]
*  second to move [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=411.12s)]
*  hostages where they are in a place that the Hamas things are not safe enough for their purposes and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=413.0s)]
*  The most important thing is to have an overall view of the Israeli [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=420.48s)]
*  Forces on the ground because you have to take into consideration [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=426.44s)]
*  The Hamas does not have the full [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=429.6s)]
*  Picture where we are and what we are doing because they are partially blinded [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=433.08000000000004s)]
*  By the fact that they have to hide in the tunnel [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=438.72s)]
*  Yeah [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=442.12s)]
*  this will enable them to see the overall picture and [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=442.32s)]
*  This can be a major risk to the Israeli forces that are right now on the ground [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=446.79999999999995s)]
*  So did I guess the next question would be okay? We know part of the negotiation with Hamas [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  But what does this mean for the Houthi rebels? What does this mean for Hezbollah? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=458.52s)]
*  Do they pause as well or are they gonna be assisting Hamas? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=463.28s)]
*  Trying to get some of their major commanders out of town [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=468.12s)]
*  Because I think that's part of the calculus here they can always [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=472.32s)]
*  Reorganize and get more [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=476.59999999999997s)]
*  Folks on the ground, but they need their leaders to stay in place for the ideology purposes, right? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=478.64s)]
*  Absolutely, I think the Hamas I think the Hamas is trying desperately [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=486.91999999999996s)]
*  to gain support from the Houthi from Hezbollah from Iraq and from other places and [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=492.08s)]
*  Especially from the West Bank [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=500.92s)]
*  Right now that failed on all fronts. I mean as a Hezbollah is joining the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  War but on a very very medium scale [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=510.12s)]
*  So, of course the Houthi and the Hezbollah will try to let's say increase [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=515.16s)]
*  their effort for support, but I'm not sure how much it is [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=522.4s)]
*  Working and how much it's actually supporting the Hamas leaders [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=527.9599999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of people who feel as though Hezbollah has got to be neutralized at the end of this conflict because you [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=533.16s)]
*  There's a lot of people in Israel do not feel safe. Even if Hamas is virtually defeated and destroyed [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=538.0s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. So dad appreciate it. Absolutely [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=544.64s)]
*  Thank you for having me [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=548.4399999999999s)]
*  You got it. Happy Thanksgiving [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=550.48s)]
*  Turn into Fox weather alert a powerful storm system pounded more than 30 states with snow and plenty of rain here on the East Coast [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  Brian, all right [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=559.88s)]
*  Lawrence the storm is disrupting Thanksgiving travel plans at airports across America on what could be [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=561.4s)]
*  The busiest travel day in American history and we are [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=567.48s)]
*  248 years young right now folks are pouring into airports across the country to get to their holiday destinations dating all the way back to [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=571.9599999999999s)]
*  1776 [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=580.0s)]
*  Day right and this is bad news on the busiest day more than [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=582.72s)]
*  370 flights are delayed this morning with another 40 cancelled [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=587.56s)]
*  Let's check in with senior meteorologist Jancy for our Fox weather forecast in this historic moment [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=591.42s)]
*  History in the making right here. We had 2.5 million people are close to it passing through the to a TSA checkpoint [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=597.44s)]
*  That's up from 180,000 or 180,000 more [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=604.24s)]
*  Than last year. So let's take a look at it. We've got [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=609.16s)]
*  1,400 flights in the air [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=612.2s)]
*  352 delays 40 cancellations the worst delays right now in Atlanta, New York and Los Angeles [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=614.24s)]
*  And we have that coastal storm that is moving offshore. That's part of the problem along the East Coast [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=619.84s)]
*  Temperatures ahead of the front warmer than average [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=626.28s)]
*  Except when you go up to North New England and Canada where we've got snow flying and that's going to disrupt things [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=629.36s)]
*  And even though this storm is gonna move offshore, it's the winds behind it that will cause delays and the cancellation [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=635.84s)]
*  So even though the radar looks good, you know, the winds will definitely cause some issues in the air [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=642.96s)]
*  Here's the snow still to come for parts of New England [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=647.88s)]
*  Certainly Maine will get the bullseye of over a foot in some areas. So that front moves offshore [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=650.68s)]
*  That's the same storm system that brought the severe weather including tornadoes this week [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=656.28s)]
*  And then a new storm system moves into the northwest otherwise a pretty good-looking forecast as we get into Thanksgiving [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=661.24s)]
*  We do have that new storm system moving across the Rockies and that's going to bring some snow a white Thanksgiving [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=667.7199999999999s)]
*  But for the rest of the country pretty good and above average for a lot of folks if there is a silver lining [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=673.3399999999999s)]
*  You are delayed tomorrow is a better day and Friday will be good as well in terms of weather and getting to grandma's house [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=678.88s)]
*  fingers crossed [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=686.56s)]
*  The turtleneck I like that that's my favorite time of year [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=688.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I used to beg my mom not to have to wear why I felt like I was choking to death [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=695.5999999999999s)]
*  I go mock turtle but mock turtle [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=702.3199999999999s)]
*  Please [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=706.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you have pictures somewhere? Yeah, I'll get one of you is the worst picture day. I don't wear a turtleneck [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=708.56s)]
*  No one's wearing turtlenecks. She didn't believe me [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=714.0799999999999s)]
*  But just to get over your head I guess had a big head just get over your head [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=718.64s)]
*  It was I felt for a moment. I could lose breath. They could have extra large [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=722.0999999999999s)]
*  Turtleneck that would be you extra large now. We know we're getting brighter for Christmas [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0jX4L25ONU&t=726.4799999999999s)]
