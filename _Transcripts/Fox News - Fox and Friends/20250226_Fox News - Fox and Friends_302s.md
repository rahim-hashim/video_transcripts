# 'CROSSED A LINE': Homan sends fiery message to anti-ICE activists
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM)
*  with Mexico, we want them to do more. I know Pete's been talking to them, we're going [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=0.0s)]
*  to have meetings with them later this week as well. We'd like to work with Mexico to [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=3.5s)]
*  go after these cartels because they're a threat to the Mexican government, not just to us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=7.26s)]
*  We want them to do more, but they've deployed what, 14,000 of their National Guard to their [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=10.58s)]
*  border. We've provided them information about certain cartel leaders and they've gone after [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=14.66s)]
*  them. But you know, we've got to keep this going. This isn't like a one week or one month [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=19.18s)]
*  thing. We've got to make sure this is enduring. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  So the Trump administration pushed Mexico to take on the cartels and gangs along our [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=26.599999999999998s)]
*  southern border. As President Trump labels eight Latin American cartels as terrorist [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=30.779999999999998s)]
*  organizations. But as our Tom Homan joins us now. Good morning, Tom. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=35.339999999999996s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=41.0s)]
*  So the Secretary of State Marco Rubio making it very clear that Mexico needs to do more. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  What can they be doing to help us secure the border and stop the flow of the drugs? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=49.46s)]
*  Well, look, I think President Trump's already gotten them put in military on the northern [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=55.8s)]
*  border. That's a strong presence against cross border crime by the cartels. So they stepped [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=60.84s)]
*  up in that. I think they need to share more intelligence with us on the criminal cartels [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=64.84s)]
*  and areas of operation in Mexico. And look, President Trump is designated in terrorist [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=68.88s)]
*  organization. We need to treat him exactly like that. Anybody associated with him, anybody [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=73.88s)]
*  funding him, anybody transporting for him are part of a terrorist organization. We need [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=77.92s)]
*  to put the whole weight of the world, the United States government on them and not just [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=82.58s)]
*  in Mexico, the Jalisco cartel, the Santa Lola cartel. There are over 40 countries around [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=85.9s)]
*  the globe. We got to attack this globally. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=91.14s)]
*  You know, Tom, I was a little disturbed the other day when I found out about these Los [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=94.5s)]
*  Angeles protesters, activists. They're posting the photos, the names, the phone numbers of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=99.62s)]
*  ICE agents. You've been in law enforcement for a long time. What can be done to go after [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=106.0s)]
*  these people? Because right now they're aiding and abetting the enemy by all these bull horns, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=113.0s)]
*  but they're also causing great danger to our federal agents. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=118.64s)]
*  Look, I think they crossed the line. They started posting pictures and addresses of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=123.0s)]
*  phone numbers. Look, Lawrence, I got state troopers around my house 24-7 right now because [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=127.64s)]
*  of death threats. Look, I know what it's like to be Doc. These agents don't deserve [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=132.44s)]
*  that. These agents put a gun on their hip and wear a Kevlar vest every day trying to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=136.62s)]
*  make their community safer. We've been really clear. We're focusing on the worst of the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=141.06s)]
*  worst. We're focused on criminal threats and national security threats. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=145.38s)]
*  So I got in a meeting with the Department of Justice today and what we can do about [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=150.06s)]
*  this. I think it crossed the line of impeding a federal law enforcement officer and a performance [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=153.42s)]
*  of their duties. So I'm hoping we find out who these people are and we can criminally [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=158.22s)]
*  prosecute them. But we'll address that first thing this morning as soon as I get to the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=161.54s)]
*  White House. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=164.88s)]
*  Oh, I can't wait to hear about that. Maybe I'll see you around here on the campus. I [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=165.88s)]
*  wanted to get you to respond to some of the demonization of what you're doing here. But [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  when you talk with local residents on the ground, they say something different. This [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=174.44s)]
*  is what a Bronx resident had to say. Watch. And this is the quote. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=178.94s)]
*  This doxing in many times is not just... [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=184.12s)]
*  I have a young woman who comes to me to study. I've never been afraid in the South Bronx. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=189.82000000000002s)]
*  I am now terrified. I'm terrified for me, for my students. I would have to move. You [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=195.18s)]
*  have made a terrible mistake. They're talking about this shelter that they were planning [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=200.98000000000002s)]
*  in the Bronx right here. So when you talk to the media, they say something different. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=207.18s)]
*  But when you talk to the people that actually live in the communities, they want these folks [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=211.66000000000003s)]
*  gone. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=215.42000000000002s)]
*  You're exactly right, Lawrence. Look, I've been around the country doing many operations [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  in the community, whether they see it at the airport, whether they see it at a restaurant, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  or out doing the operation. I can't tell you how many members of the community come up [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=226.0s)]
*  and thank us for being there. You know, President Trump made a promise to American people when [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=230.11999999999998s)]
*  he got elected that he's going to make our community safer, especially from illegal, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=234.64s)]
*  alien, violent crime. That's exactly what we're doing. And we're doing it across the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  nation. As far as the politicians who want to push back and attack the men and women [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=242.0s)]
*  of ICE and myself, I'm not running a popularity contest. I'm out there doing what the President [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=246.04s)]
*  promised the American people were going to do. We're out there enforcing the law without [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=251.14s)]
*  apology. We're going to keep coming. You can put all the roadblocks you want up. We're [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  going to keep coming. For these sanctuary cities who want to push back and impede us, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  we'll double the man force there. We'll double worksite enforcement there. We're not going [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  away. We're going to keep coming at them until every criminal, illegal, alien gang member, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=266.74s)]
*  every illegal, alien criminal is eradicated from this country. That's when I'll be satisfied. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=271.98s)]
*  Yeah. You and the over 60% of Americans that agree with you. The polling is going up for [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=277.0s)]
*  mass deportations because you guys are targeting the criminals. Tom Homan, thanks, brother. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VrQiCnCpgM&t=287.28000000000003s)]
