*  a concern for people in North Carolina now you have what the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=129.82s)]
*  Redneck Air Force is there you have a lot of special forces [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=132.92s)]

*  they're saying we're not seeing FEMA's help so Peter do see I [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=141.56s)]
*  want you to set this up yesterday was talking to KB [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=144.8s)]
*  what happened well just because people are frustrated so you [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=147.4s)]
*  know last week Joe Biden sent a letter to the leaders in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=151.24s)]
*  Congress, the top 4 people and said you're going to have to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=155.44s)]
*  come back and you're going to have to give us more money for [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=158.18s)]
*  FEMA because we don't have as my orcas and we reported this [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=160.38s)]
*  last Thursday. My orcas said we don't have enough money if [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=163.88s)]
*  there's one more hurricane hurricane season runs through [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=167.16s)]
*  November they had no idea there would be a major hurricane [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=170.24s)]
*  bearing down on Florida today. So Peter do see took all this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=174.02s)]
*  information about how Lebanon's getting a 157 million new [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=178.52s)]
*  dollars immediately but the people of the Carolinas there's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=183.7s)]
*  no money for them that led to this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=187.5s)]
*  And on this issue of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=191.06s)]
*  the administration has money to send to Lebanon [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=194.8s)]
*  without Congress coming back. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=198.28s)]
*  But Congress does have to come back to approve money to send [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=200.38s)]
*  to people in North Carolina. Do I have that right? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=204.12s)]
*  Here's what I'm going to be very clear about the president [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=207.12s)]
*  of vice president has had a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  robust whole of government response to this hundreds of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=212.36s)]
*  millions of dollars I said at the top more than 200 million [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=217.2s)]
*  dollars but instead people want to do disinformation [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=219.6s)]
*  misinformation which is dangerous. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=223.1s)]
*  President Biden is fond of saying show your budget and I [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=226.64s)]
*  will tell you what you value if he's got money for people in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=229.78s)]
*  Lebanon right now without Congress having come back. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=233.85999999999999s)]
*  What does it say about his values. There's not enough [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=236.92s)]
*  money right now for North Carolina is that's not [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  misinformation. Wait no that is your whole your whole premise [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=243.1s)]
*  of the question is misinformation Sir what you [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  don't yes yes it's misinformation the way you're [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=249.5s)]
*  asking me the question is misinformation there's money [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=251.83999999999997s)]
*  that we are allocating to the impacted areas and there's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=254.94s)]
*  money there to help people who truly need it there survivors [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  who need the funding who need the funding and it's there [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=262.04s)]
*  you don't like misinformation. I said that I actually said we [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=265.68s)]
*  have the money available to help survivors of Hurricane [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=268.98s)]
*  Helene and also Hurricane Milton what you're asking me is why [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=273.42s)]
*  Congress needs to come back and do their job. That's what [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=277.56s)]
*  you're asking me Congress needs to come back and do their job [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=279.8s)]
*  and provide extra assistance extra funding to disaster [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  relief fund. That's what Congress needs to do and we're [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  going to continue to urge that you may not want that but [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=287.78s)]
*  that's OK that's what this president wants and that's what [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  the vice president wants thanks everybody. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=292.26s)]
*  First. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=299.24s)]
*  His expression is his facial expression is all of us right [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=301.14s)]
*  now trying to figure out what was that and just before we [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  even get to the the substance of the argument. The White House [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=308.14s)]
*  press corps has to push back on every time a reporter asked a [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=311.64s)]
*  question that they don't like that it becomes misinformation [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=316.12s)]
*  they have been wrong on so many things but they call him this [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=319.06s)]
*  some misinformation every single time. Number two I don't think [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=322.16s)]
*  it's too much to answer the question why why Americans being [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=324.76000000000005s)]
*  put last when it comes to this issue. It's not that we don't [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=328.5s)]
*  support other countries and want to help build them up and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=332.54s)]
*  yada yada yada yada but the comparison of a hundred and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=334.98s)]
*  fifty seven million dollars compared to a hundred million [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=337.98s)]
*  dollars in the middle of a crisis and then saying that you [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=340.68s)]
*  got to beg Congress for more money to help the people of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=343.2s)]
*  North Carolina. It takes a lot of people all you know. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=346.4s)]
*  Peter's point you cannot call a question you don't like [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=350.44s)]
*  disinformation but that's what she did. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=354.2s)]
*  I believe it was a couple of weeks ago, I think she referred [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  to one of his questions as being dangerous he was asking [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=359.54s)]
*  a fair question why is it dangerous why would she so why [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=362.02s)]
*  would she say that stuff keep in mind I think was last Friday [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=365.22s)]
*  she was made a senior adviser to Joe Biden because she's done [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=368.62s)]
*  so well as press. And here's what she was doing yesterday. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=372.6s)]
*  She was defending the absolutely atrocious optics of the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=376.1s)]
*  administration sending a hundred and sixty seven million [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=380.44s)]
*  dollars to Lebanon while the people of North Carolina are [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=383.94s)]
*  going to have to wait for Congress to pass more money it [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=387.38s)]
*  is a bad look and she has to defend it and instead she what [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=390.44s)]
*  she's trying to do is confuse people. Wait is Peter asking a [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=394.72s)]
*  question that's not fair. No the question was fair and the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=398.32s)]
*  answer was not right. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=401.88s)]
*  The most still sitting on 4.5 billion dollars in unused of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=404.06s)]
*  funds from Super show. Sandy yeah, they do hold on to in [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=407.96s)]
*  case people file late that's one he's already tapped into [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=411.92s)]

*  I know there was a flood. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=517.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  Where this whole question came from was the comment Harris [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=526.7s)]
*  goes out over the weekend and announces hey [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=529.46s)]
*  we were sending all this money to Lebanon and that's what [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=533.7s)]
*  prompted that meanwhile she's back in the news she sat down [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=537.26s)]
*  with Bill Whitaker from CBS yesterday and Bill Whitaker [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=539.82s)]
*  asked a lot of really good questions. He did not get a lot [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=543.36s)]
*  of good answers. For instance, we all regard the border [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=546.26s)]
*  immigration as one of the top three and her biggest weakness. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=550.16s)]
*  Well, absolutely with this administration when you look at [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=553.54s)]
*  the numbers and you've seen the jaw dropping numbers here he is [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=556.0s)]
*  he has to ask her three times about what this administration [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=559.1s)]
*  is doing and three times. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=562.84s)]
*  She doesn't answer. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=565.44s)]
*  There was and his story flood of undocumented immigrants coming [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=566.42s)]
*  across the border the first three years of your [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=572.36s)]
*  administration's a matter of fact arrivals quadrupled from [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=575.62s)]
*  the last year of President Trump. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=579.7s)]
*  Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=582.76s)]
*  as you did. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=588.9s)]
*  It's a long standing problem. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=589.7s)]
*  And solutions are at hand and from day one literally. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=591.9399999999999s)]
*  We have been offering solutions. What I was asking was was it [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=596.48s)]
*  a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=600.62s)]
*  place. I think the policies that we have been proposing are [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=606.06s)]
*  about fixing a problem not promoting a problem. Okay, but [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=610.92s)]
*  numbers did quadruple and the numbers today because of what we [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=614.66s)]
*  have done. We have cut the flow of illegal immigration by half. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=618.8s)]
*  Should we have done that the flow of fentanyl by half, but [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=626.76s)]
*  we need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=630.9s)]
*  problem. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=636.54s)]
*  From day one we have been offering solutions. These are [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=638.12s)]
*  her solutions stop the border wall and remain in Mexico [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=641.68s)]
*  policy allow Venezuelan illegal immigrants to remain in the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=645.3199999999999s)]
*  United States create controversial migrant parole [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=648.5s)]
*  programs decriminalize illegal immigration offer health care [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=651.02s)]
*  to illegals hotels and food and education. So these solutions [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=654.52s)]
*  seem to benefit the illegals not the Americans who are paying [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=659.28s)]
*  for it. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=662.66s)]
*  And this is the result. The result is Trump in total had [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=663.76s)]
*  2.4 million across the border and she has 8.3 and counting [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=667.32s)]
*  that's up 241.5% and part of the reason why the numbers are [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=672.2s)]
*  down now number one the summit executive orders were affected [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=676.5999999999999s)]
*  and some know some are just because people use the app [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=679.26s)]
*  there in Ecuador El Salvador and they're able to apply for [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=681.9599999999999s)]
*  to the State Department to get in for asylum and there go to a [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=686.8399999999999s)]
*  central location will be flown in so they don't count as a [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=689.98s)]
*  border crossing and they end up in your town by your NGO and [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=692.38s)]
*  soon they can end up in your school they rewrite the rules [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=696.7199999999999s)]
*  and try to claim credit number 2. It's the summertime, it's not [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=699.3199999999999s)]
*  a lot of people crossing border they'll die, especially when [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=703.5799999999999s)]
*  you're coming across Texas border and that's why the [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=705.84s)]
*  numbers were down during that period of time it still doesn't [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=708.78s)]

*  years if they want in any border legislation they could [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=717.76s)]
*  have got it done but they didn't want that they the [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlVA3tjJGVU&t=721.3s)]
