# Biden-Harris admin is trying to ‘deceive’ the American people: Expert
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o)
*  Lieutenant Christopher Oliveras joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=0.0s)]
*  An absolute flip flop on all these issues, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=3.64s)]
*  saying that she, you know, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  previously saying she wanted to get rid of ICE, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  she wanted to close ICE detention centers. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=10.6s)]
*  Now she's saying she wants to secure the border [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=12.8s)]
*  and support those agencies. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=15.08s)]
*  You're in Texas, you hear overwhelmingly from, you know, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=17.28s)]
*  citizens and fellow law enforcement. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=20.52s)]
*  Do they believe this new position, this new change? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=23.16s)]
*  Good morning, Rachel. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=27.88s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=28.72s)]
*  Of course, we look at that and we look at some of that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=29.56s)]
*  message and as you mentioned, we look beyond that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=31.32s)]
*  When they first mentioned, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  when the vice president actually mentioned [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  that they wanted to decriminalize illegal immigration [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  and abolish ICE, you know, that in itself [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  sends a clear message to those that want to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=41.16s)]
*  make the journey to United States [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=43.6s)]
*  that there is not gonna be any consequences [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=45.08s)]
*  if we do cross the border illegally. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=47.379999999999995s)]
*  And we've seen that in the last two and a half years [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=48.72s)]
*  with these disastrous border policies. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=51.0s)]
*  So people that understand the border, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=53.4s)]
*  that have been following the border, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=55.96s)]
*  especially law enforcement officers, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=57.68s)]
*  first responders, military soldiers [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=60.24s)]
*  that have been on the front lines from day one, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=61.64s)]
*  they understand they're not buying the messaging right now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=63.8s)]
*  And what's to say that, you know, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=67.38s)]
*  if they do become, you know, in power again, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=69.48s)]
*  that they're gonna flip-flop or reposition themselves [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=72.56s)]
*  again where we're gonna see another [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=75.16s)]
*  catastrophic situation on our border. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=76.6s)]
*  Right now, the current situation on the border [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=78.64s)]
*  has not been secured. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=80.56s)]
*  I mean, we still have people crossing the border illegally. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=83.08s)]
*  We still have, you know, human smuggling, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=84.88s)]
*  drugs that are coming across the border, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=87.08s)]
*  transnational criminal gangs that are in the country right now [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=88.56s)]
*  that have been able to infiltrate the country [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=91.52s)]
*  and how have been able to facilitate themselves [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=93.64s)]
*  across the country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  So when you look at some of that messaging about being a, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=97.0s)]
*  you know, previous attorney general [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=100.24s)]
*  and prosecuting human traffickers and criminals, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=101.8s)]
*  well, the fact remains that in the last two and a half years, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  we have seen a record number of criminals [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=106.84s)]
*  from other countries in the country right now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=109.28s)]
*  That's why we now, we see migrant crime, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=111.44s)]
*  something that we have never experienced before. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=113.36s)]
*  The cartels have been able to establish themselves [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=115.44s)]
*  and be able to expand their criminal network [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=117.58000000000001s)]
*  throughout the United States. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=119.5s)]
*  And human smuggling continues to be a serious problem [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=120.7s)]
*  on the border as well involving children. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=123.26s)]
*  So it has not been secured. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=124.9s)]
*  If they really wanna do something about the border, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=127.34s)]
*  they're still in power right now, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=129.1s)]
*  they can actually do something today, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=130.3s)]
*  but they still refuse to do so. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=132.54000000000002s)]
*  Do you know what they did do? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=134.02s)]
*  They restarted the CHNV program [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=134.94s)]
*  that is bringing citizens from Cuba [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=137.38s)]
*  and Nicaragua and Venezuela and Honduras [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=140.3s)]
*  over to the United States. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=144.22s)]
*  They're processed in country [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=145.22s)]
*  and then flown over. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=147.9s)]
*  I spoke with Tom Homan earlier this week [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=148.74s)]
*  and he said that program is in place [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=151.78s)]
*  to change the numbers. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=155.06s)]
*  So those people that come over through that program [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=156.66s)]
*  are not counted in the illegal crossings [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=159.5s)]
*  that cross through the land. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=163.1s)]
*  And so that way they can artificially [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=164.66s)]
*  keep their numbers low and pretend [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=166.9s)]
*  that they're actually doing something on the border [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=169.9s)]
*  when in fact they're doing the opposite, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=172.18s)]
*  they're increasing them. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=173.9s)]
*  You know, absolutely right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=176.26s)]
*  Of course, Tom knows better. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=178.1s)]
*  I mean, the fact is that, you know, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=179.14s)]
*  right now the current administration [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=180.98s)]
*  are trying to deceive the American people [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=182.38s)]
*  by keeping the number of illegal border crossings low, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=184.62s)]
*  which in fact they are. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=187.42s)]
*  They've been low since January. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=188.26s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=189.7s)]
*  Well, it's a political year. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=190.54s)]
*  And obviously they want to avoid the negative optics. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  They know that the border situation [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=193.98s)]
*  is a very serious issue across the country. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=195.18s)]
*  So what better way to get the numbers down right now [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=198.1s)]
*  to actually do something like that, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=201.82s)]
*  not only through direct flights, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=203.06s)]
*  but also the CBP One app. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=204.66s)]
*  Those numbers are not counted in the overall number [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=206.1s)]
*  of illegal border crossings. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=208.54s)]
*  So of course it's gonna look like the border [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  is somewhat secured when you have numbers down, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=212.1s)]
*  but it's quite the contrary. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  And that's one thing that American people need to understand [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=216.14000000000001s)]
*  is don't be deceived by those type of optics. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=217.94s)]
*  We do have a very serious situation on our border. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=221.54000000000002s)]
*  The message remains the same here in Texas, Rachel, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=223.9s)]
*  from Governor Abbott, our Lieutenant Governor, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=226.54000000000002s)]
*  our legislators, we all have been the same [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=228.58s)]
*  as far as the messaging. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=230.3s)]
*  We're gonna continue using every resource [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=231.46s)]
*  that are disposed at the state level [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=233.78s)]
*  to help secure the border. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=235.18s)]
*  We have not backed down. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=236.5s)]
*  We're gonna continue moving forward. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=237.82s)]
*  I know you guys are working hard. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=238.66s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=240.58s)]
*  I've been with you on the ground [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=241.58s)]
*  and I see what you guys are doing. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=242.9s)]
*  And it just feels like it's no wonder [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=244.94s)]
*  that people are getting demoralized [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=247.78s)]
*  because you're getting no federal support. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=249.14s)]
*  By the way, that CHNV program was suspended [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=250.34s)]
*  because of corruption. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=253.5s)]
*  You know, you had one sponsor sponsoring 1,800 people, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=255.54s)]
*  you know, illegals. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=259.94s)]
*  I mean, this thing is, it's a joke, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=261.42s)]
*  but we appreciate how you guys keep plugging away [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=263.90000000000003s)]
*  and trying your best and bringing attention to the issue. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=266.26s)]
*  So Lieutenant Oliveras, we really thank you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yAHXuTU9o&t=268.34000000000003s)]
