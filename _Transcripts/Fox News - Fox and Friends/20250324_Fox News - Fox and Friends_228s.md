# Trump: Dems are 'making a mistake' by not talking about this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk)
*  Well, Maine University's agreeing to keep transgender athletes out of women's sports, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=0.0s)]
*  but the state's public schools are still under investigation for alleged Title IX violations [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  with a Thursday deadline, or else the Trump administration has warned that they'll pause [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=10.74s)]
*  the funding. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=15.58s)]
*  President Trump saying it all comes back to common sense. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=17.06s)]
*  I think it's a 90-10 issue, maybe more, but I do notice that it's a 90-10 when the voter [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=20.42s)]
*  booths closed. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  You know, when that curtain's pulled or whatever happened to people, but a lot of people don't [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=29.72s)]
*  talk about it, and I don't know why they make a mistake by not talking about it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=34.44s)]
*  It's such a simple thing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=38.48s)]
*  Well, our next guest is a varsity high school athlete who suffered firsthand from Maine's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=39.96s)]
*  transgender athlete policies. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=45.959999999999994s)]
*  Cassidy Carlisle joins us now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=48.04s)]
*  Cassidy, welcome. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=50.8s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=52.959999999999994s)]
*  I'm going to start by saying you're quite an accomplished athlete. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=54.64s)]
*  Soccer, Nordic skiing, track and field, really impressive. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=57.96s)]
*  Now since you started junior high, you've had to change in front of trans athletes, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=61.92s)]
*  you've had to, or students, you've had to compete against them. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=68.12s)]
*  I guess my question to you is, how has all of these trans policies affected your childhood? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=71.0s)]
*  You know, I think it's one of those things when it happens, like, you don't know what [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=78.88s)]
*  to do, but you definitely know something is wrong. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=85.36s)]
*  You know, I was 13 years old and I knew something was wrong, but I didn't know what to do. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  I didn't have the platform to speak, and I think that makes it really hard because you [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  feel like you don't have a voice, but that's not true, and I hope by me speaking up that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=95.48s)]
*  a lot of younger people know that it's okay to speak up. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=99.92s)]
*  Yeah, seventh grade, having to change in front of a man, child abuse. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=102.92s)]
*  You said you weren't able to speak, you didn't feel like you felt like there could be a backlash [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=107.92s)]
*  if you spoke up. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  Is that why? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=113.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=114.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=115.04s)]
*  But you did speak eventually, and you gave a really important and big speech in front [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=116.44000000000001s)]
*  of your state Capitol to your message was to Governor Janet Mills, who's continued these [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=121.2s)]
*  policies despite being told by the Trump administration that they need to end. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=126.72s)]
*  So what was your message to the governor? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=130.96s)]
*  My message to the governor was just to think about all of us women in her state. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=134.32s)]
*  You know, if she can genuinely look at us and say, I'm not going to fight for you, then, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=138.76s)]
*  that's really heartbreaking because we had to fight a long time for her to have the position [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  that she has, and a lot of women fought hard for her. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=147.72s)]
*  So for her to look at all of us and say, I'm not going to fight for you is heartbreaking. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=150.12s)]
*  Yeah, hypocritical at that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=153.88s)]
*  You spoke there, you've also gone to the White House. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  I think you just think back about five or six years, a lot of parents were afraid to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  stand up for their girls because they would be socially shamed in their communities or [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=165.84s)]
*  accused of being a bigot. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  You see that tide turning, right? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=172.12s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=174.52s)]
*  I mean, A.G. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  Bondi was absolutely amazing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=176.36s)]
*  She she acted and treated us like she just wanted to hear our stories and and that she [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  told us, you know, you are not going to fight this alone anymore. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=184.28s)]
*  How did it feel to tell your story? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=187.84s)]
*  You know, it's sad that it's a story that I have, but I'm glad that I have the space [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=191.36s)]
*  to share it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=197.4s)]
*  Hmm, beautiful. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=198.84s)]
*  Well, Cassidy, you are a very courageous young woman. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=199.88s)]
*  You're an incredible athlete. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=203.36s)]
*  But more importantly, what you got inside shows right through. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=205.08s)]
*  So God bless you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=208.52s)]
*  And thanks for standing up for so many other young women, something your own governor [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=210.28s)]
*  sadly can't do. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=214.76s)]
*  Cassidy, thank you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naf9b14gArk&t=216.04s)]
