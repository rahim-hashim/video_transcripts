# Jon Stewart tears into CNN anchor for Biden cover-up
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ)
*  The Daily Show host Jon Stewart is calling out Jake Tapper over his new book about former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=0.0s)]
*  president Joe Biden. The comedian is questioning why Tapper didn't report on Biden's mental decline [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=5.68s)]
*  sooner after Tapper told his audience quote, you will not believe what we found out. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=12.64s)]
*  Don't news people have to tell you what they know when they find it out? Isn't that the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=18.4s)]
*  difference between news and a secret? Breaking news in a week. Tapper has been accused by some [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=31.0s)]
*  of being part of a broader media cover-up over President Biden's mental fitness while in office [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=40.72s)]
*  and those are your headlines. It's a killer. It's so true. Because all they're doing is trying to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=47.28s)]
*  sell this guy's book when he could have had those same contacts got those same answers four years [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=54.68s)]
*  ago and the New York Post in their editorial today said there's got to be a bipartisan look [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=60.08s)]
*  on why the 25th Amendment wasn't used. 100%. Because their cabinet secretaries that said that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=64.88s)]
*  his meetings were incomprehensible and they needed to give the questions to their own president [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=70.52s)]
*  ahead of time so we can get the answers on a card. I asked Pete Buttigieg at the DNC and these people [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=78.16s)]
*  lie so much and he pretended like it never even happened and now they're saying we need a ceasefire [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=84.8s)]
*  because now and we're all praying for the president trust me we believe in prayer but the idea just [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=90.32s)]
*  that we're just gonna let this be sweep under the rug is not happening. He says the cover-up doesn't [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=96.96s)]
*  work when everyone knows they're lying. He said it's weird that the news is selling you a book [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=102.44s)]
*  about the news they should have told you was news a year ago. Right and by the way Zeke Emanuel who [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=106.24s)]
*  worked for Biden's transition team and was his COVID advisor said he did not develop cancer in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  the last 100 200 days. He had it while he was president. He probably had at the start of his [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=117.63999999999999s)]
*  presidency. I don't think there's any disagreement on that and that Dr. Kevin O'Connor should hand in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=121.96s)]
*  his lab code between saying the president was thinking clearly and was a hundred percent healthy [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  all a lie a big lie or the worst doctor ever. Well Biden even said a few years ago I have cancer [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=132.44s)]
*  and then they said he misspoke. 2022. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQ4mON3QcQ&t=138.72s)]
