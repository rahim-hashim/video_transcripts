# Outraged Chicago mother whose son was murdered sends message to Dems
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c)
*  So the DNC plans to highlight Vice President Kamala Harris' fight for everyday Americans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=0.0s)]
*  today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=4.84s)]
*  But she previously supported a bail fund that put criminals back on the street, including [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=5.84s)]
*  someone who committed murder after he was freed. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=10.24s)]
*  Our next guest lost her son Jeremy to senseless violence in Chicago last year and still doesn't [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=13.44s)]
*  know what happened. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=19.2s)]
*  Moni Jacobs, join me now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=20.48s)]
*  Moni, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=22.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=24.72s)]
*  This is supposed to be a happy time for you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=25.72s)]
*  You're supposed to be dropping off one of your babies to college. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=28.48s)]
*  But you can't do that with all that passion because you still don't know what happened [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=32.56s)]
*  to your son. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=38.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=39.2s)]
*  Every day is hard. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=40.6s)]
*  And it's hard when you can't be weak and hurt because you have to be strong for your other [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=41.6s)]
*  children. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=47.72s)]
*  Especially my daughter because she's in college and she's trying to do something with her [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=49.28s)]
*  life. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=53.68s)]
*  And it's hard for her. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=54.68s)]
*  So she calls a lot, Mom, I need you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=55.68s)]
*  How am I supposed to go on without my big brother? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=58.44s)]
*  Even though she has another one, they're more like twins. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=60.92s)]
*  So it's hard for her. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=63.84s)]
*  But I have to understand where she's coming from and put my feelings to the side to make [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=65.6s)]
*  her feel better so she won't lose focus while she's in college. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=71.28s)]
*  You told me that they don't call you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=76.52s)]
*  They don't. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=79.32s)]
*  They don't provide updates. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=80.32s)]
*  You have to call them. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=81.32s)]
*  How does that make you feel? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=82.32s)]
*  I'm angry. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=83.72s)]
*  But when I call, I try to be humble. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=85.36s)]
*  You know, don't go in hostile to an environment. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=88.28s)]
*  Even though you're mad and you're hurt, you have to still talk to them with respect. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=93.08s)]
*  But they don't give that to me. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=97.12s)]
*  You don't even call me to update me about anything. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  And I think that's unfair. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=102.2s)]
*  The story you give me is not the right story because I know my son. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=106.16s)]
*  We know him. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=112.72s)]
*  And you can't tell me what you told me and think that I'm just going to let that go [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=113.72s)]
*  because that's not what happened. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=118.96s)]
*  And I know you know more. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=121.12s)]
*  But you don't call me and update me about anything. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=122.64s)]
*  And I think it's unfair that I have to keep calling you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=125.64s)]
*  But he's the top case, you told me. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=129.16s)]
*  He's your priority. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=131.04s)]
*  But how could you not reach out to me and keep me updated about what you're finding [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=132.7s)]
*  out? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=137.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=138.56s)]
*  You know? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=139.56s)]
*  It's hard to unsee the things that me and my kids had to see. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=140.56s)]
*  It's just hard. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=144.8s)]
*  You're not a political person. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=147.4s)]
*  You just want justice for your baby. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=148.4s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=150.72s)]
*  But when you hear all of these politicians saying, just let the criminals back on the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=151.72s)]
*  street, it's the same revolving five people in Chicago were killed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  That's not even the people that were shot over the weekend. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=159.12s)]
*  Every single weekend, it seems like I'm getting some type of alert or I have had to talk to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  some mom that said their baby shot in the front yard. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=166.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  What do you think our leaders need to do to secure safety for people? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  You need to buckle down a lot more. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=176.04s)]
*  You worried about the wrong, wrong situations. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=178.6s)]
*  You're worried about like politics. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=183.0s)]
*  I'm not into that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=184.56s)]
*  Never been. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=186.2s)]
*  But even if I decided to this year, how can I? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=187.2s)]
*  Who can I trust? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=191.32s)]
*  So I don't know who to vote for. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=192.6s)]
*  I'm not even getting help with my own city, you know, trying to figure out what happened [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=194.76s)]
*  to my son. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=198.4s)]
*  It's not fair. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=200.16s)]
*  It's just not. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=202.2s)]
*  So a lot of the politicians today say the reason why they are more soft on crime and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=203.2s)]
*  have bill laws where the same criminals get back on the street is because they feel like [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  it's a justice issue. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=214.12s)]
*  What would you tell them? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=216.24s)]
*  Focus more on helping. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=220.16s)]
*  We're losing babies. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=222.16s)]
*  You know, we're not losing the elderly as fast as we're losing our young people. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=223.88000000000002s)]
*  They're not even getting a chance to grow up. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  I'll never know what it feels like to have a grandchild from him. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  Like we're losing our future, you know? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=235.52s)]
*  I don't know what else to say to them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=239.8s)]
*  Like, what is it going to take for you to step in and do what you're supposed to do [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=243.36s)]
*  to protect the community? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=247.44s)]
*  You're not doing that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  Because if you were, we would have answers about everything. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=250.52s)]
*  Babies getting shot in the front yard, as you said. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=254.84s)]
*  Like I don't even watch the news anymore. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=257.44s)]
*  I seen him on the news and it's like it was flashbacks. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=259.76s)]
*  So no, I'm not into what's going on. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=264.44s)]
*  You go on Facebook, Instagram, whatever, the social media, you always see somebody's up [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=266.8s)]
*  there shot women, kids, young men, you know? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=272.0s)]
*  Do you think they'll see it now that they're having a major convention here? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=278.16s)]
*  Like what is your message for the Democratic Party? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  A lot of people that look like me and you, give our votes to them. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=285.48s)]
*  What is your message to them as we hold the biggest convention? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  We're going to have the most powerful men in the nation, in the world today. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  Give a speech today. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=298.20000000000005s)]
*  What do you want to hear from all these leaders? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=299.44000000000005s)]
*  I want to know what they're going to do to protect our communities. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=301.32000000000005s)]
*  I'm not going to focus everywhere, but my focus is here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=305.72s)]
*  This is my home. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=308.04s)]
*  I've been here all my life. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=309.04s)]
*  I want to know what they're going to do to bring justice to the parents who are losing [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=310.68s)]
*  their kids. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=314.16s)]
*  Like what are you going to say to them? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=315.16s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry, it's not working. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=317.64s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=320.12s)]
*  Like I call. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=321.12s)]
*  I need answers. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=322.12s)]
*  You're not giving me anything to close. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=323.12s)]
*  Like I can't, my five-year-old granddaughter misses him like crazy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=326.8s)]
*  What am I supposed to say to her? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=333.2s)]
*  Nanny, what happened? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=335.56s)]
*  I don't know, babe. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=337.12s)]
*  You don't have an answer for me. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=338.12s)]
*  I don't have an answer because nobody's giving me an answer. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=339.92s)]
*  So I don't know what to do in those circumstances. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=343.64s)]
*  You understand? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=346.24s)]
*  I understand. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=347.24s)]
*  How can I vote for somebody who I don't feel like has my back? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=348.24s)]
*  Or any parent who lost their child's back. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=353.04s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=355.8s)]
*  Like what are we supposed to do? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=356.8s)]
*  You want me to vote for you? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=358.6s)]
*  What are you going to do for me? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=359.6s)]
*  You say what you're going to do, but when you get in the office, do you really do [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=362.24s)]
*  what you said you're going to do? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=365.2s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=366.56s)]
*  Because this crime has been going on for decades and it's getting sickening to watch parents [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=368.08s)]
*  on TV crying about the loss of their child. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=373.8s)]
*  Like it's hard. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  We have to bury someone that grew inside of you. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  I never thought the hurt would be this bad. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=382.28s)]
*  It's like I lost my mom and my dad. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=384.8s)]
*  Oh, that was hard. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=387.84s)]
*  But this was just way over. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  It's too much hurt. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=393.0s)]
*  Mr. Jacobs, I promise we're not going to let his memory go in vain and all the rest of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=394.2s)]
*  the victims out there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=399.12s)]
*  Thank you so much for getting up this morning with me. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=400.6s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCvrHVdL0c&t=402.36s)]
