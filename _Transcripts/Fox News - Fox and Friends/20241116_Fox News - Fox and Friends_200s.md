# 'PRETTY CLASSLESS': Ex-ESPN host scolds Dems, media over attacks on Trump picks
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI)
*  Democrats and their media are on the attack going after president-elect Trump's cabinet and top staff picks including outrageous claims [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=0.0s)]
*  Against our very own Pete Hicks. Seth. It was up for defense secretary as Trump's administration continues to take shape [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  So let's get reaction from sage deal the host of the stage seals show and she joins us now. I say hello [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=14.24s)]
*  I am so glad to see you guys in person [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Glad to do it. So happy you're here. So it's almost it's almost hard to tailor a question [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=23.16s)]
*  It's almost hard to narrow it in because the attacks have been so broad so vile [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=28.6s)]
*  Whether or not they're at Pete or Tulsi or RFK [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=32.64s)]
*  So maybe the question is and you and I and Rachel that matter we've all worked in media [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=36.0s)]
*  And maybe even some of these institutions who are lobbying some of these attacks [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=39.92s)]
*  What do you take from their reaction to Trump's nominations to his cabinet? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=44.28s)]
*  Disappointment, but not surprised. Yeah, you know [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=49.16s)]
*  Pretty classless. It's one thing to say I disagree and give valid reasons why maybe [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=52.72s)]
*  Examples, but to me it's just completely personal [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  But again, I'm not surprised. I think at the end of the day [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=60.28s)]
*  They have to understand what has led us to this point and it's been what 11 days since the election [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=63.68s)]
*  Because the only reason we're in this position is because of what they did and did not do over the last three and a half [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=69.4s)]
*  Four years and so you knew that if Trump won and then of course he did [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=75.44s)]
*  By a margin that I don't think any of us did any of us expect that I did not expect it to be nearly as dominating [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=79.8s)]
*  As it was we know Donald Trump and he's going to get his people in there mainly because he has to fix [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=85.18s)]
*  What they did and did not do over the last four years and I actually love this because he's been very candid [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=91.02000000000001s)]
*  I when he was on Rogan that was one of my favorite things [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=96.54s)]
*  When asked what could I have done differently my first term unlike Kamala Harris's answer? He said you know what? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=98.9s)]
*  I really don't think I did a good job [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=104.5s)]
*  Maybe vetting everybody and bringing the right people in and waiting too long to fire people as well and this time he's vetting [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=106.26s)]
*  He's at a lot of time several years to think about who he would put in there, and I love the picks [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  I say let's go yeah like a rip out the roots rip out the corruption get and you're so right. It's such a reaction [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=117.94s)]
*  This mandate that he got as you said I expect him to win [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=126.26s)]
*  I didn't know he'd win by that much, but it is a reaction to COVID [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=129.46s)]
*  Corruption to all the things that we've seen that the the censorship the the big tech censorship all of this stuff is part of it [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=134.06s)]
*  And you know I didn't know all these this these years that I've been with Pete Hexeth on the couch [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=141.5s)]
*  And he was a white supremacist [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=146.02s)]
*  I know and but again just so narrow-minded and an idiotic for them to say that because actually [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=149.66s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why they lost the election [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=156.58s)]
*  Yeah, because of the hate because the name-calling because you say everybody's right [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=158.74s)]
*  I've been called a racist by these people guys which I think is fascinating and a misogynist again [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  It's just that me too and they told they were actually said they wanted that I should be deported [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  I cannot yeah, but that's one of the reasons why they lost the election because because it's nothing to do with I mean [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=171.45999999999998s)]
*  They didn't even know what policy she stood for right, but they sat there and they called everybody names names that were it was lies [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I know a lot of these people I've been around a lot of these people there are no racist [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=185.42s)]
*  You can have a difference of opinion and not resort to that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  And I think that there's their idiots at this point for continuing to do exactly what lost them this election [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgY2VkQJRYI&t=193.38s)]
