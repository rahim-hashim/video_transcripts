# COMPLY OR ELSE: AG Bondi sends warning to liberal sanctuary cities
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI)
*  In Illinois the governor has vowed to resist Trump and the DOJ in the Trump's administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=0.0s)]
*  They're suing them over their sanctuary city policies. Yeah, so the DOJ and Pam Bondi [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=6.08s)]
*  They're they're saying not only not only the state but the local government too [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=11.36s)]
*  You have the city of Chicago and Cook County. So it's the governor that's involved Pritzker and it's also the mayor [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=16.76s)]
*  Brandon Johnson is that his full name and so they're suing over their sanctuary city laws because they're prohibiting them the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=24.08s)]
*  Federal government from going in and arresting and detaining someone based on their immigration status [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=30.88s)]
*  They say that the local laws are designed to and in fact interfere with and discriminate against the federal government's enforcement of federal immigration laws [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=35.68s)]
*  All right, Hughes Pam Bondi [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=44.0s)]
*  They are choosing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=46.56s)]
*  Illegal aliens over the safety and security of their own citizens and the men and women of law enforcement [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=48.28s)]
*  Who are out there trying to protect their citizens? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=55.04s)]
*  Not only did we sue today the city of Chicago we sued the state of Illinois [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  We sued the mayor we sued the governor and we sued others and let me be very clear [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=62.900000000000006s)]
*  If you don't comply with federal law, you're gonna be next right? So it makes it more dangerous [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=68.68s)]
*  And I also like to add something else. It's really important for [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=73.84s)]
*  Media and other locals not to tip off ice raids because you don't like President Trump's foreign policy [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=78.32s)]
*  These ice raids are for legal aliens [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=85.68s)]
*  Most of which have committed crimes and if you find yourself tipping them off, you're gonna end up in jail [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=88.56s)]
*  Tom Homan is pretty much said it's gonna be a media blackout now [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=93.98s)]
*  So we're not gonna get to see a lot of these raids and what's happening from a transparency a moment [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=96.68s)]
*  But I think it's important is the point that you just made [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=101.88s)]
*  The federal government is not asking the locals or the states to help them with all deportations [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  That's not what they're saying. They're saying when you have a criminal migrant in custody if they committed rape [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=110.66000000000001s)]
*  Violent offenses murder or anything like that to just hold them in prison so they can go and pick them up and take them in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=116.04s)]
*  They're cuz they're not asking them to go on raids or anything like that or hold people that are for nonviolent offenses [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=122.4s)]
*  Violent offenses keep them in custody. That's it, right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=129.16s)]
*  And also some TDA guys yes, the TDA guys are going to Gitmo the Venezuelan gang also [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  They did admit they were letting go some illegal aliens [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=138.62s)]
*  They said they had some of that old mindset [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=141.32s)]
*  So Tom Homan was arresting them and some people at Border Patrol were letting them go and now we've gotten past that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, one thing that they're dealing with right now is there there's some holdovers from the last administration [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=149.92s)]
*  That is still in key positions and they're obstructed [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=154.04s)]
*  We saw this in the Pentagon with six here defense Pete Hagseth as well. And so they're having a clean house [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  It's gonna take some time as I continue to say it's gonna be some bumps in the roads [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=161.92s)]
*  But I think the outlook has been productive. Yeah. Well, we're sitting in a sanctuary city. That's right, right [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=165.39999999999998s)]
*  But we have a mayor that doesn't want to be that's important [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9PjhjS85EI&t=171.64s)]
