*  The terrorism that exists and people in the evil out there that that they want to afflict [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=152.46s)]
*  America and so again we [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=158.5s)]
*  Continue to have an outpouring of prayer and support for those families again as you walk through that list [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=161.18s)]
*  A lot of those are Louisiana [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=167.78s)]
*  I'm gonna be going over to the crime scene [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=170.34s)]
*  again this morning [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=173.7s)]
*  and walking through it [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  Hoping to maybe reach out and talk to some of those parents as well and to make sure [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=178.5s)]
*  That they're getting the support that they need so that they can start to work on some closure and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=182.82000000000002s)]
*  But again, you know, it's prayers and support and the only thing that'll get them through is our faith, you know, governor [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=189.9s)]
*  We're praying for your state. I'm from the state of Texas and so we're neighbors [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=195.68s)]
*  No, Bourbon Street all too. Well, it's known as a happy place and you can have a good time there [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=200.02s)]
*  I want to get your thoughts on the investigation [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=205.10000000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of back and forth about the state of emergency but still having the game as well [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=208.9s)]
*  We were told that there are co-conspirators that are out there based on the information that you're getting [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=215.78s)]
*  Is there still still a threat of people that help this guy do this out there in Louisiana? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=221.26s)]
*  Look, I think one of the most important things is to make sure that each one of those victims [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=229.3s)]
*  Did not die in vain [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=234.54s)]
*  All of them had come to the city in order to enjoy the city in order to enjoy [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=237.5s)]
*  Some entertainment and ring in the New Year [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=243.22s)]
*  Y'all had a guest earlier who was an eyewitness who said the same thing is that we can't live in fear [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=245.78s)]
*  We need to be able to live our lives and what we plan to do is ensure that as we [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  Remember those folks that we put New Orleans back in a position where people can come and have a good time [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=256.74s)]
*  We believe that the city I'm convinced that the city is safe. Look this can happen in any city [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  But we you know, I've issued an executive [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=271.5s)]
*  Ordering emergency declaration. We've got a hundred military police officers that are on the ground [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=275.42s)]
*  Our sheriffs from around the state have sent additional resources [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=280.34s)]
*  The FBI has been pouring resources into the city since yesterday. We're getting some more today as well [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=284.7s)]
*  I'm hoping to give the media an update on that. Hopefully mid-morning [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=291.78s)]
*  We're hoping to have more information to be able to give to the media. We want transparency. We want the answers [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=295.9s)]
*  I know that there are a lot of people out there that want the answers [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=302.35999999999996s)]
*  Why what what happened and we're gonna get to those but we want to make sure that we don't impede the investigation [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=305.78s)]
*  As we move forward [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=312.38s)]
*  Governor Sandra here. Thank you so much for your time this morning [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=314.41999999999996s)]
*  We know there's obviously a lot happening right at this hour as far as the federal investigation on the ground there [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=317.42s)]
*  But to your point in your words [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=323.34s)]
*  You're hunting the bad people down. There was a suggestion that there are [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=326.34s)]
*  More people involved that this was some somehow a coordinated effort. What can you tell us about that right now? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=330.18s)]
*  Yeah, you know Sandra as much as I'd like to be able to report that the one thing we don't want to do is put out [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=337.42s)]
*  speculation or [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=343.52s)]
*  Information that we we have not been able to confirm and that is what I think is important because if we put something out [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=345.7s)]
*  And then it comes out to be not true or not completely accurate [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=351.94s)]
*  Then we're back inside of a pretty bad news cycle, right and we're giving people and especially those those families out there [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  Mixed emotions and mixed information [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=363.94s)]
*  So what we want to do is make sure that the information we put out to y'all is completely accurate [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=366.09999999999997s)]
*  So that we can get to some closure [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=370.98s)]
*  I can tell you this we're going to ensure that everyone who is involved in this [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=372.82s)]
*  horrific [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=379.86s)]
*  Act of terrorism is going to be held accountable [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=381.86s)]
*  Governor, I'm sorry real quick governor. I hate to jump on you, but there's conflicting information [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=385.38s)]
*  On one hand you're telling the people that it is safe [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=392.14s)]
*  But then you have coke and spiders that are out there and then to layer on that of getting all the information [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=395.42s)]
*  We just had your attorney general your chief law enforcement officer [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=400.78s)]
*  It says she hasn't even been briefed about those people that they brought into custody [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=403.73999999999995s)]
*  So if your chief law enforcement officer is not being briefed about the people that are out there [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=408.5s)]
*  How can the people have confidence? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=414.5s)]
*  Well, look I can tell you this I am in the city right now. I'm going to attend the sugar bowl this afternoon [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=417.94s)]
*  I will be around we are going to be briefing the media [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=425.46s)]
*  Hopefully about mid-morning. I don't know about the comments that the attorney general made [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=429.78000000000003s)]
*  Again, that's part of why we try not to engage in speculation [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=435.74s)]
*  I think that every one of the elected officials should use the information that they're getting [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=439.7s)]
*  directly from law enforcement directly from the Louisiana State Police and the FBI and not continue to feed on innuendos [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=445.1s)]
*  I've been trying to be couched in information that I report back to the media [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=452.86s)]
*  Specifically because of that what I can tell you is that we believe that based upon the information that we're getting from the federal government [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=458.54s)]
*  And my Louisiana State Police that this city is as safe as it's been [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=466.58s)]
*  Look, this can happen in any city every look we had an incident in Las Vegas [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=472.74s)]
*  On on yesterday, but I can tell you this there are a lot more [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=478.06s)]
*  Resources and law enforcement offices in the city of New Orleans right now than they were 24 hours ago [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=482.02s)]
*  Again, you know at the end of the day we need we need not let fear [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=489.82s)]
*  Paralyze us. That's the problem in this country, right when we do that the terrorists win [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=494.9s)]
*  Understand that point and there is governor two sides of that argument the safety and security and of course the resilience [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=500.58s)]
*  In not letting the terrorists win but you know you mentioned Las Vegas just hours apart a couple of time zones apart [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=506.92s)]
*  The country started the year with terror attacks and it frightened them [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=514.12s)]
*  And so I'm asking you is are you getting real-time? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=519.76s)]
*  Information in briefings from the federal investigators about whether or not there may be any connection [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=524.88s)]
*  Between Las Vegas and what happened in your city? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=532.32s)]
*  Look we're getting [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=535.8s)]
*  Briefings I'm getting briefings from the FBI almost on an hourly basis [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=537.8s)]
*  and again [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=542.04s)]
*  I'll tell you this the only way to protect people from evil is to crush it and believe you me [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=542.7199999999999s)]
*  inauguration day cake comes soon enough because the one person that understands that is [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=548.4s)]
*  Donald Trump I can I can and I can tell you this too his Homeland Security pick [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  Governor Kristi Noem who I served with in Congress understands that as well [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=558.88s)]
*  And they're going to work with us to put policies in place that protect the American people and not the criminals that are out there [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=563.28s)]
*  Governor I know you're heading to the Sugar Bowl tonight [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=572.04s)]
*  Any anything you can share with us about your plans and and what security is gonna look like? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=575.36s)]
*  Look security is going to be tight [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wq-cUZbsE&t=581.16s)]
