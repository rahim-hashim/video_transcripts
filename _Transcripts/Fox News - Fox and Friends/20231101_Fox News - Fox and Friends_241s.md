# Democrats don’t care about this: Rand Paul
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA)
*  GOP Senator Rand Paul sits on the Senate Homeland Security and Foreign Relations Committee and joins us now. So Senator, 14 billion [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=0.0s)]
*  Broken up not 110 billion. That's going to come for this going to be voted on on the house [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=7.36s)]
*  The senate's going to bundle it up. Where do you stand? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  You know, I think president biden's bluffing. I don't think he'll veto aid to israel [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=16.16s)]
*  You really think he's going to stand up in front of the world and say oh [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=20.48s)]
*  We're not sending aid to israel just because it's paid for [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=23.04s)]
*  I like what speaker johnson has done. I think it's the conservative thing to do [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=25.919999999999998s)]
*  It's what conservative voters at home tell me friend or foe [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=29.6s)]
*  Whoever we're giving the money to it ought to be paid for because our national debt is threatening our national security [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=33.12s)]
*  Can we give israel some money? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=39.68s)]
*  Yeah, but it ought to be paid for in order to be paid for by taking it away from something that is harmful to our economy [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=41.04s)]
*  And that's more irs agents. So I think this is a win-win if we get it done [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=46.8s)]
*  I also think that those who want the waste basket the kitchen sink everything in it 100 billion dollars [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  And they absolutely don't want to pay for I don't think that's a conservative position [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=56.959999999999994s)]
*  And I think mcconnell biden and schumer are going to lose on this ultimately [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  Or if they force their way they could potentially topple the speaker of the house, which I think is a terrible idea [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=65.6s)]
*  Right. I mean that their own body and I think the republicans might stick together for once [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  But do you think that there'll be a promise to bring back ukraine aid separately bring back taiwan aid separately [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=75.92s)]
*  Bring back border separately [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=80.96s)]
*  Well, i'm not saying that everything will be separate [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=83.28s)]
*  I think this aid is going to be separate because I think it is okay a great deal of agreement [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=85.52s)]
*  We'll see what happens. I think there may be trying to bundle together other parts of aid [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=89.84s)]
*  But i'll insist the same whether it's ukraine or israel that it's paid for and so there's 44 billion in irs money [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=93.92s)]
*  I'm more than happy to rescind all of that if necessary [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Senator senator, I want you to listen to chris ray you lived through it, but here's the fbi director [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=104.88s)]
*  Concerned about what's happening in the middle east coming through our borders. Listen [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  We assess that the actions of hamas and its allies will serve [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=114.88s)]
*  As an inspiration the likes of which we haven't seen since isis launched its so-called caliphate [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=119.52s)]
*  Several years ago. We also cannot [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=125.6s)]
*  And do not discount the possibility that hamas [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=128.72s)]
*  Or another foreign terrorist organization may exploit the current conflict to conduct attacks here [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  Your own soil are we doing enough to stop it being that he's citing it [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=139.2s)]
*  No, and I think it's a real national security [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=144.0s)]
*  Insult or a real national security threat to our country is our southern border [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  But you have to change policy. You can't just throw money at it [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=151.28s)]
*  So one of the things that biden is proposing in this huge foreign aid package [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=154.32s)]
*  Is just throwing money at the border which a lot of people think will go to just give aid in comfort to the migrants and put [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  Them into sanctuary cities. What we need to do is change the law. They need to remain in mexico [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  And there needs to be an orderly process [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=168.88s)]
*  But they can set up camps on the mexican side and the migrants will get tired of being in camps on the mexican side [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=170.56s)]
*  And they'll quit coming [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=176.32s)]
*  But we have to change the law [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=177.44s)]
*  We can't let people set foot in our country and get all kinds of rights the courts have granted them [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=178.72s)]
*  Congress needs to act but the reason congress doesn't act is democrats don't care and democrats truly want an open border [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=184.16s)]
*  And if you don't believe me look at their statements and see what happens every time we try to bring something up [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  They have to be put back i'm all for legal lawful immigration. In fact, i'm for more of it [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=196.88s)]
*  I think immigrants are great people for our country, but we can't have a million undocumented people coming across [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  So they need to remain in mexico [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=208.0s)]
*  We have to change the law and everybody that comes across breaking the law needs to be put right back on the other side [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=209.52s)]
*  Senator which you said is totally logical. You have there's a track record for it. Unfortunately [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=215.6s)]
*  I think you have to wait a year for another administration [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=219.68s)]
*  In order to implement it and you voted for jack lew you just told me just because you want an ambassador over there [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=222.16s)]
*  Not that he was the ideal candidate. Uh, thanks so much senator. I appreciate it. I'm steve ducy [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claibVTK5lA&t=227.04000000000002s)]
