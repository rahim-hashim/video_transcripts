# Byron Donalds: ‘Keep’ TikTok if you can ‘protect the privacy of Americans’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU)
*  Let's bring in congressman from the great state of Florida Byron Donalds and congressman. It's good to have you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks for coming with you guys. How you doing doing? Okay got some questions though before we start talking about some of the news today [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=5.76s)]
*  You had seats [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=11.68s)]
*  Back there. Oh, yeah great ones, too [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=13.68s)]
*  Okay, so now are you even gonna be invited inside? I think how it's going as members of Congress. I believe we're gonna be inside [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=16.72s)]
*  And then I think what I should know was saying is correct [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=24.64s)]
*  Everything else for people to get in is gonna be super tight. I know everybody's scrambling trying to figure it out [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=27.96s)]
*  It's a tough transition. But listen the weather here has been really cold yesterday was actually nice [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=33.88s)]
*  Yeah, so I think people like well, it's nice now. It's 40 degrees [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=39.68s)]
*  Don't take that for what's gonna happen on Monday. The temperatures are gonna drop pretty fast. It's gonna change [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=43.32s)]
*  Let's get your thoughts on tick-tock because Trump just says as the president-elect [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=47.72s)]
*  He said we're gonna save tick-tock. I talked to him yesterday morning. He said he's gonna person negotiate the deal [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=51.68s)]
*  Has a framework in mind. What is your viewpoint on this? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=56.92s)]
*  Should it be open back up or should it continue to be shut down as long as you can protect the privacy of Americans? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=61.0s)]
*  Then yeah, get the app as long as you could do that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=69.6s)]
*  That was always the key issue and I think that President Trump's gonna find a way to get that done [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=72.48s)]
*  Listen a funny thing happens when you go over the deadline [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  All of a sudden all of the the people of the things that bite dance was saying they would not do now become credible [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=80.0s)]
*  Will do but see what happens. Here's what kills me [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  They have two other but once a bite dance two other Chinese apps [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=88.48s)]
*  Yeah, they're gonna do the same thing that they're getting millions of followers. They're the tick-tock users are going there [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  They're gonna have the same problem [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=97.34s)]
*  Why don't they just stick to the rules if you're a foreign entity or an enemy nation? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=98.68s)]
*  You cannot have a social media presence in our country [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=102.4s)]
*  I mean look the reason why I think the Chinese don't want to stick to the rules when it comes to operating in our markets [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  Is because typically we don't have leadership that actually upholds our rules [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=111.76s)]
*  That's what happens with trade policy all the time [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  So you have a president in Donald Trump who's going to make sure that not just China [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=117.84s)]
*  But every other nation abides by the rules of the United States when you don't have consistent leadership you get stuff like this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=121.98s)]
*  That's why Donald is one of the reasons Donald Trump is back [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=128.28s)]
*  You got to continue that up and have that not a hard stance, but a firm stance [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  Right, so whether China or anybody else you agree it's gotta be sold though [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  Because yeah, I do because the Chinese Communist Party has control over that their editor-in-chief is the general secretary of the Communist Party [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=138.96s)]
*  It would come on. I voted I voted to shut down the app. Yes [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=146.96s)]
*  It needs to be sold and look I get it Americans love tick-tock [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=150.8s)]
*  But we're not gonna let their information be at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=154.84s)]
*  The newsfeed being China's newsfeed. That's right [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=160.76s)]
*  Well, if you think about it though if Donald Trump in his first week or two [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=162.88s)]
*  We're able to save tick-tock for the hundred and seventy million Americans who use it [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  They'd be going like you know what I like that guy. He's smart. He sees the numbers. He'll figure a way to do it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=172.16s)]
*  It's not just gonna be that I mean when Americans see [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=179.44s)]
*  Deportations or repatriations happen. They're gonna be like, thank you when I see the border closed [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=182.64s)]
*  This is what I voted for when they see peace starting to like break out again around the world [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=188.28s)]
*  They're gonna be like this is the stability that we were asking for daddy's back [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=193.12s)]
*  So that's what you're gonna see. So you just touched on it is tomorrow the deportations are gonna start or the repatriations are gonna start [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=197.36s)]
*  Repatriations are gonna start. Is that what we're gonna call it? That's what they are people have to be able to go back home [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=205.28s)]
*  I would add some people in my office who were Democrats from my district [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=209.84s)]
*  Concerned about how this is gonna work and I asked them I said if you allow [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  The neighborhood children to come to your home and start breaking stuff. Do you let them stay? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=218.56s)]
*  And they said no, they got to go home [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  I said exactly our nation cannot allow for all of the illegal immigration that Joe Biden allowed on his watch to continue [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  The most cost-effective thing the safest thing and the best thing for the American people is we're gonna have to repatriate people to their home [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=232.52s)]
*  Countries. Yeah, there's an article that I was reading this morning top Trump ally Byron Donalds turns up volume on likely [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=239.24s)]
*  2026 run for Florida governor. Do you want to break some news this morning? No, that's a great headline. I like it [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=248.12s)]
*  Are you thinking about it? I know last year you were interviewed and you said I I don't want to rule anything out [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=254.52s)]
*  I never rule anything out. I mean you can't in politics [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=259.32s)]
*  The number one thing you have to do is your job [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=262.36s)]
*  So we have an agenda to get through for the American people the first hundred days is gonna be critical [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  Once we get through that then we'll see where things are [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=268.68s)]
*  But right now the job is in that building behind you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=271.34000000000003s)]
*  We have a responsibility the president has a mandate and we're gonna deliver if you did decide to run for governor [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=274.0s)]
*  How would that work? Because there's a little territory right there [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=280.96s)]
*  you had the primary and most of the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=285.38s)]
*  Republican delegation went with Donald Trump where you have Ron DeSantis who's the governor now in Florida [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=288.4s)]
*  He was running against have y'all put that behind you and he's not gonna get involved in the governor race [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=294.29999999999995s)]
*  Or will that be problematic? I don't know. I mean look I think whether it's President Trump or Governor DeSantis [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=300.16s)]
*  They'll probably have conversations around that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=306.44s)]
*  The first thing is you actually have to see people get into the race and you don't really know what those dynamics are until the field [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=308.68s)]
*  Is set its politics is like boxing styles make fights. That's just the way it is [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=314.52000000000004s)]
*  And so once that gets said then I think all the other pieces start falling [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=318.92s)]
*  When will you announce a decision if you plan on seeking office? I don't know that man. I can't give you that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=322.16s)]
*  You need about two years right don't you think you need about a year and a half to get to ramp up [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  Everybody's everybody's campaign strategy is different. You know, it's can you build name ID? Do you have name ID? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=333.12s)]
*  Do you have the ability to raise the resources? Where are voters on the ground? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=338.36s)]
*  Do you have support networks around the state all those different dynamics really dictate how much time you need to ramp up a campaign? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=342.12s)]
*  Well, if you decide [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  The desk is always open. Actually, we've got a couch in New York City Byron. Thank you very much [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=350.24s)]
*  God [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=355.02s)]
*  Congratulations. Thank you. So it's easier on your family to as a governor one state travel. That's what congressman, but he'd have to move to Tallahassee [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=356.21999999999997s)]
*  This is beautiful this time of year. Yeah, his wife is a fighter too though. So she we're working out the entire family [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9pfCSQczeU&t=363.34s)]
