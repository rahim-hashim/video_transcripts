# Trump's fault? Harris raises eyebrows with answer to Bret Baier
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA)
*  It's a must-see Fox News interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=0.0s)]
*  Brett Baer pressing Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=4.32s)]
*  on everything from the border to the economy [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=7.12s)]
*  during her first formal sit-down interview with Fox News. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=9.6s)]
*  So, in less than three weeks to election day, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=12.48s)]
*  the Democratic nominee was asked about her steady defense [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=14.88s)]
*  of President Biden's mental fitness. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=18.12s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=20.92s)]
*  You told many interviewers that Joe Biden was on his game, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=22.96s)]
*  that ran around circles on his staff. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=26.84s)]
*  When did you first notice that President Biden's mental faculties [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=29.24s)]
*  appeared diminished? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=32.48s)]
*  Joe Biden, I have watched from the Oval Office [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=35.92s)]
*  to the Situation Room, and he has the judgment [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=40.64s)]
*  and the experience to do exactly what he has done [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=44.8s)]
*  in making very important decisions [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  on behalf of the American people. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=51.16s)]
*  There were no concerns raised? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=52.68s)]
*  Joe Biden is not on the ballot. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=54.36s)]
*  So, it was a tense interview at times [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=56.44s)]
*  as the Vice President tried to die some questions [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=58.48s)]
*  and point the blame toward Donald Trump. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  And Brett says he had to quickly wrap up the interview [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  after her team signaled him to stop. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=66.0s)]
*  There are critics who look at what the administration did [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=69.52s)]
*  and say and think differently. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=72.4s)]
*  Madam Vice President, they're wrapping me very hard here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=74.24s)]
*  I hope you got to say what you wanted to say about Donald Trump. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=77.64s)]
*  There are a lot of things that... [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=81.0s)]
*  There's more to say. I have much more to say. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=82.16s)]
*  Madam Vice President, they're giving me a hard wrap here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=84.08s)]
*  Well, I thank you for the time. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=86.4s)]
*  They were giving him a big wrap. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=88.56s)]
*  So, that is how the interview ended after 26 minutes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=91.8s)]
*  Now, let's show you how it started [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=96.32s)]
*  with tough, direct questions on the border, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=98.44s)]
*  the kind she has not faced before. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=101.72s)]
*  How many illegal immigrants would you estimate [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=106.4s)]
*  your administration has released into the country [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=110.24s)]
*  over the last three and a half years? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=113.44s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you raised the issue of immigration [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  because I agree with you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=117.52s)]
*  It is a topic of discussion that people want to rightly have. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=118.4s)]
*  And you know what I'm going to talk about right now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=123.72s)]
*  Yeah, but do you... Just a number. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=126.0s)]
*  Do you think it's one million, three million? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=127.2s)]
*  Brett, let's just get to the point, okay? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=129.52s)]
*  The point is that we have a broken immigration system [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  that needs to be repaired. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=136.12s)]
*  So, your Homeland Security Secretary [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=137.6s)]
*  said that 85% of apprehensions... [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=139.16s)]
*  I'm not finished. We have an immigration system... [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=141.16s)]
*  It's a rough estimate of six million people [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=143.08s)]
*  that needs to be... have been released into the country. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=145.12s)]
*  And let me just finish. I'll get to the question, I promise you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=147.56s)]
*  I was beginning to answer. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=149.6s)]
*  And when you came into office, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=150.88s)]
*  your administration immediately reversed [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=152.84s)]
*  a number of Trump border policies. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=154.4s)]
*  So, looking back, do you regret the decision [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=156.88s)]
*  to terminate Remain in Mexico [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=160.6s)]
*  at the beginning of your administration? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=162.4s)]
*  The first bill, practically within hours of taking the oath, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=165.28s)]
*  was a bill to fix our immigration system. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=170.16s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. It was called the US Citizenship Act of 2021. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  It was essentially a pathway to citizenship for the... [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. May I finish responding, please? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=180.6s)]
*  But you have to let me finish, please. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=183.28s)]
*  You had the White House and the House and the Senate, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=184.6s)]
*  and they didn't bring up that bill. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=187.04s)]
*  I'm in the middle of responding to the point you're raising, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=188.4s)]
*  and I'd like to finish. Yes, ma'am. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  We recognized from day one [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  that to the point of this being your first question, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=197.56s)]
*  it is a priority for us as a nation [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=200.48s)]
*  and for the American people. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=203.76s)]
*  And our focus has been on fixing a problem. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  So, here's the hard part. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=209.76s)]
*  Brett only has, I think, 25 to 26 minutes for an interview. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=211.76s)]
*  If you allow the person that you're interviewing to monologue, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=217.92s)]
*  you won't get to the substance. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=220.44s)]
*  And so, I think he had the balance, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  asking a tough question and letting her repeat the talking points [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=224.48s)]
*  instead of just getting to the point of the substance of the question. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=228.48s)]
*  A lot of times, she talked in circles, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=232.56s)]
*  and she wasn't really answering the question. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=234.56s)]
*  So, he had to inject the facts, bring her back to her record, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=236.8s)]
*  and then give her a chance to respond, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=240.88s)]
*  but she never really answered any of the questions. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=242.6s)]
*  Most of the time, it was deflecting to Donald Trump. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, she continuously talks about that US Citizenship Act, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=248.56s)]
*  acting like we were trying to do something for the border. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=252.64s)]
*  But then, Brett last night said, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=255.16s)]
*  that would have given 11 million illegals amnesty, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=256.44s)]
*  a pathway to citizenship. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=259.12s)]
*  It's called the US Citizenship Act. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=260.32s)]
*  And so, that didn't pass. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=262.68s)]
*  Congress did not pass that, even though Congress, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=264.44s)]
*  he said Democrats had the control of the House and the Senate. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=267.84s)]
*  But that's not what people wanted. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=270.48s)]
*  People wanted the situation at the border fixed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=271.92s)]
*  They didn't want to give a pathway of citizenship to 11 million people. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=275.84s)]
*  So, he asked a bunch of questions that she did not answer, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=279.32s)]
*  and usually, she would just deflect to Donald Trump. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  There was one thing that we did hear last night that was new. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=287.68s)]
*  In 2019, when she was running for president, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=291.92s)]
*  she said that she would decriminalize southern border crossers. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=295.68s)]
*  Last night, she said, essentially, she would follow the law, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=301.0s)]
*  and she would not decriminalize border crossers. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  So, that was new. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=307.76000000000005s)]
*  Unfortunately, it comes too late for a number of American families. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=309.56s)]
*  At one point, Brett asked whether or not the administration, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=314.0s)]
*  and Kamala Harris, owes an apology to the families of victims [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  who were murdered by people who came into this country illegally. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  We have told you the story of Rachel Moran. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=328.24s)]
*  Patty Moran, her mother, was on with this about 45 minutes ago, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=330.88s)]
*  and she was very clear. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  She blames this administration for the death of that woman, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=338.68s)]
*  her daughter, Rachel, who was 37. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=343.44s)]
*  Here's Patty, the mother, with us. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=346.88s)]
*  And I've talked to people that have lost children, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=350.4s)]
*  and they said the pain never goes away, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=352.52s)]
*  that I'm going to walk with it the rest of my life. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=354.76s)]
*  That's an unbearable thing. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=358.28s)]
*  I want to feel happy again, and I don't know how to do that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=359.76s)]
*  It's like, this should not be. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=364.44s)]
*  And if they had secured the borders, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=366.96s)]
*  and just American people should come first. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  That's why we elect these officials, to protect our country, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=372.79999999999995s)]
*  not to open the border. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=377.35999999999996s)]
*  One thing that Kamala Harris expressed [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  in the interview with Brett Baer [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=383.08s)]
*  is how she felt bad for the families that were impacted, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=384.76s)]
*  but she hasn't reached out to the families. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  In fact, when Kareen Jean-Pierre was asked, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=391.0s)]
*  is the president of the United States [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=392.96s)]
*  going to reach out to these families, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=395.0s)]
*  he continued to say, Kareen Jean-Pierre, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=397.0s)]
*  she continued to say that it was an ongoing investigation. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=399.52s)]
*  Also, during the interview with Brett Baer, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=402.84s)]
*  when he pressed her on these positions that she had [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=404.68s)]
*  when it comes to the border and decriminalizing [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  and the gender-affirming care that the government pays for, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=410.76s)]
*  she said that was a position that was held five years ago. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=414.24s)]
*  So is it now the position of the administration, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=417.28s)]
*  the positions that Donald Trump, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=419.52s)]
*  or things that y'all bring up in his past [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=421.44s)]
*  from five years ago? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=423.2s)]
*  Anything past five years [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=424.4s)]
*  should not be brought up in the conversation? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=426.28s)]
*  It's just ridiculous. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=428.44s)]
*  Well, that's why, I mean, elections have consequences, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=429.56s)]
*  and when you know that Rachel's death was preventable, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=432.02s)]
*  that people here illegally are murdering, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=435.2s)]
*  they murdered Laken Reilly, Jocelyn Nungery, Rachel Moran, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=438.59999999999997s)]
*  those were mentioned last night with Brett Baer. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=442.32s)]
*  You hear the pleas of a mother, I mean, to lose your child, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=444.86s)]
*  it would be so heartbreaking, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=449.68s)]
*  and she said, I wanna be happy again, and I can't be, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=451.34s)]
*  but this was preventable, and that's what's so sad. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=455.14s)]
*  Her daughter would be here, and those little ones, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=457.9s)]
*  she had how many children? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=460.26s)]
*  Five children, is that right? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=461.41999999999996s)]
*  Five children, and those little ones are growing up [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=462.97999999999996s)]
*  without their mom because someone was here illegally. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=466.02s)]
*  That's not right. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=468.9s)]
*  So going in, Kamala Harris knew that there were gonna be [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=469.73999999999995s)]
*  a lot of questions about the border and migration, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=472.34s)]
*  and she had some prepared answers. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=474.52s)]
*  She knew, okay, whatever it is, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=476.9s)]
*  I'm going to turn it around a couple of ways. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=478.66s)]
*  One, I'm gonna say what we were talking about [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=481.42s)]
*  a little while ago, and that is, well, on day one, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=483.82000000000005s)]
*  we introduced this bill that would have fixed it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=486.18s)]
*  Of course, it was to give essentially a pathway [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=488.22s)]
*  to citizenship for 11 million people [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=490.72s)]
*  who were in the country illegally. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=492.62s)]
*  The other thing is getting a lot of play [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=494.08000000000004s)]
*  by the administrator, rather, by Kamala Harris [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=496.26000000000005s)]
*  while she's out and about, talking about the border. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=499.18s)]
*  Whenever it comes to the border, she says, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=501.94000000000005s)]
*  look, Donald Trump is the one who torpedoed the chance [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=504.1s)]
*  to come up with this bipartisan Senate bill. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=507.3s)]
*  Here's the unfortunate truth for her regarding that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=509.94s)]
*  Rachel Moran was murdered over a year and a half ago. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=513.52s)]
*  Before the bill even proposed. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=516.74s)]
*  And that's exactly right, because the bill was not killed [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=518.0600000000001s)]
*  until May of 2024, of this year. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=520.74s)]
*  So had the bill passed, she would still be dead [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=524.34s)]
*  is the problem. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=528.5s)]
*  And as soon as they took office, Biden and Harris, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=529.34s)]
*  they immediately signed all these executive orders [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=532.82s)]
*  to undo, to rescind all of the things [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=534.8199999999999s)]
*  that Donald Trump did at the border, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=536.98s)]
*  including not continue the wall. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=538.22s)]
*  They also got rid of remain in Mexico. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=540.8199999999999s)]
*  And in remain in Mexico, if you're an asylum seeker [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=543.38s)]
*  and you wanna come into our country, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=545.8s)]
*  you have to remain in Mexico. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=546.98s)]
*  And that's why they call it that. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=548.86s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=549.86s)]
*  And you have to stay there until your case. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=550.6999999999999s)]
*  And sometimes that could take years, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=552.98s)]
*  but that way you're vetted, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=555.3s)]
*  that way we know who's in the country. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=556.78s)]
*  It's a huge issue for voters. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=560.3s)]
*  And the administration has yet to have a response to that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=562.4599999999999s)]
*  Another issue is the fitness of the president. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=565.9799999999999s)]
*  And they concealed them. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=568.8199999999999s)]
*  And we saw it all, the whole world saw it [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=570.2199999999999s)]
*  on the debate stage of what happened. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=572.74s)]
*  Now the reports started to leak [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=574.2199999999999s)]
*  about the fitness of the president [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=575.9799999999999s)]
*  and what's been happening behind closed doors. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=577.62s)]
*  They took him off the ticket, replaced him with her. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=579.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, she was asked about the fitness of the president. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=583.14s)]
*  And when does she know it? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=585.62s)]
*  When does she see it? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=586.9s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=588.0999999999999s)]
*  You told many interviewers that Joe Biden was on his game, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=589.58s)]
*  that ran around circles on his staff. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=593.38s)]
*  When did you first notice [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=595.82s)]
*  that President Biden's mental faculties [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=597.1800000000001s)]
*  appeared diminished? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=599.1s)]
*  Joe Biden, I have watched from the Oval Office [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=602.46s)]
*  to the Situation Room. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=607.22s)]
*  And he has the judgment and the experience [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=609.26s)]
*  to do exactly what he has done [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=613.7800000000001s)]
*  in making very important decisions [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=615.5400000000001s)]
*  on behalf of the American people. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=617.74s)]
*  There were no concerns raised? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=619.3399999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden is not on the ballot. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=620.9399999999999s)]
*  I understand. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=622.5799999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=623.9s)]
*  But you talked about it. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=625.02s)]
*  And Donald Trump is. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=625.8599999999999s)]
*  After George Clooney said within a few minutes [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=626.6999999999999s)]
*  of talking to President Biden at a fundraiser [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=628.5799999999999s)]
*  that he thought this was not the same Joe Biden [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=630.54s)]
*  that we saw on the debate stage. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=633.5799999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is on the ballot. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=634.74s)]
*  I understand. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=636.3s)]
*  You met with him at least once a week [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=637.66s)]
*  for three and a half years. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=639.14s)]
*  You didn't have any concerns? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=640.6999999999999s)]
*  I think the American people have a concern [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=643.9799999999999s)]
*  about Donald Trump, which is why the people [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=645.78s)]
*  who know him best, including leaders [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=647.74s)]
*  of our national security community, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=651.0600000000001s)]
*  have all spoken out, even people who worked for him [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=654.42s)]
*  in the Oval Office, worked with him in the Situation Room, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=657.86s)]
*  and have said he is unfit and dangerous [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=661.86s)]
*  and should never be President of the United States again, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=666.1800000000001s)]
*  including his former Vice President, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=669.74s)]
*  which is why the job was open for him [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=672.22s)]
*  to choose another running mate. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=675.9s)]
*  So that is a fact. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=678.66s)]
*  That is a fact. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=681.9399999999999s)]
*  I know she wants to deflect this to Donald Trump, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=683.9399999999999s)]
*  but does Donald Trump have some nuclear codes right now? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=686.22s)]
*  It's Joe Biden, and it's the big lie. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=690.02s)]
*  And she struggled to answer the question. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=692.9s)]
*  First of all, it took her a while before she got to Joe Biden. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=694.86s)]
*  She was not prepared for this moment. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=700.14s)]
*  And I know they just wanna push this aside, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=702.06s)]
*  but it's a real issue. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=704.5s)]
*  She's lying still about the fitness [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=706.18s)]
*  of the current President of the United States. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=708.98s)]
*  She was trying to figure this segue [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=710.78s)]
*  to go from the question to what she wanted to say. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=712.9s)]
*  You know, I don't know the timing regarding [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=716.18s)]
*  when she decided she was gonna sit down with Brett. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=719.02s)]
*  I know we all heard about it on Monday morning. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=721.82s)]
*  I think a lot of what we heard last night, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=724.54s)]
*  she had to sit down for 26 minutes [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=728.38s)]
*  to essentially say one thing. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=730.02s)]
*  And she had to say something that would clean up the mess [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=732.5400000000001s)]
*  that she made on The View last week. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=736.94s)]
*  Because The View, which, you know, super friendly venue, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=738.9000000000001s)]
*  they said, can you think of anything [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=744.1s)]
*  that you would do differently if you were president? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=746.7s)]
*  And she said, I can't think of anything. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=749.7800000000001s)]
*  Nothing comes to mind. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=751.22s)]
*  That was the mistake, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=752.0600000000001s)]
*  because people don't like Joe Biden's administration. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=753.6600000000001s)]
*  Then she doubled down on Stephen Colbert [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=756.98s)]
*  a few hours later. That's right. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=758.98s)]
*  And so I think she went out there yesterday, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=760.14s)]
*  faced the music, Brett asked her a lot of questions, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=763.66s)]
*  just to clean that up. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=766.7s)]
*  Ultimately, she declared her independence from Joe last night, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=768.1s)]
*  which we had not really seen. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=771.4200000000001s)]
*  And she said her administration [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=773.4200000000001s)]
*  would not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=775.7s)]
*  And that's the sound bite, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=779.0600000000001s)]
*  the campaign for Kamala Harris wanted out there. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=781.1s)]
*  So it's out there now. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=784.5400000000001s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=786.1s)]
*  It comes less than three weeks before the election. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=787.18s)]
*  Does it make a difference? Is it too late? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=790.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm glad Brett pressed her on, well, you're in office [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=792.3399999999999s)]
*  and you've been in office for three and a half years. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=795.66s)]
*  He said, you keep talking about turning the page. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=797.66s)]
*  What do you mean turning the page? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=800.54s)]
*  You were in office. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=801.5s)]
*  And her response was, well, Donald Trump's been running. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=802.3399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=805.3s)]
*  And she said, you know what I mean. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=806.14s)]
*  And he said, no, I really don't know much what you mean. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=809.18s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZMvKwLYyA&t=812.2199999999999s)]
