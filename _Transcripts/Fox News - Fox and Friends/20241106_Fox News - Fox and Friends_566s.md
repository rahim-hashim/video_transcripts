*  What do you make of how big the victory appears to be? I knew it wasn't even going to be close. I knew [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  he was going to win from the beginning and I want to say a shout out to all my friends in North [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=54.48s)]
*  Carolina. We took North Carolina and Pennsylvania. You just gave a shout out to North Carolina. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=58.72s)]

*  guys. That's right. Welcome to Joey's Pancake House in Maggie Valley, North Carolina. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=90.64s)]
*  The swing state of North Carolina has decided and as you can see people have turned out in droves [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=100.0s)]
*  to talk about this election so I want to talk to some of the diners and see how the people are [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=110.8s)]
*  feeling. This is my friend Terry. Terry how are you feeling about Donald Trump's second victory? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=115.76s)]
*  I love it. I love it. I love it. And this is Becky. Everybody here knows Becky right? I've heard a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  lot about my friend Becky. I heard that she has a lot of thoughts about the election so what are [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=125.84s)]
*  you thinking? I'm just tickled to death because I'm telling you we can't have four more years of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=131.04s)]
*  what we've had. There's absolutely no way. The gas prices, the groceries, I mean it's been terrible [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=135.2s)]
*  so now Trump's gonna make it great again. So Becky thinks Donald Trump's gonna make it great again. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=142.0s)]
*  That's a little bit about what people are saying in Maggie Valley at Joey's Pancake House in [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=149.28s)]
*  North Carolina. I'll send it back to you guys in New York City. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=153.76s)]
*  We are live in Tyrone, Pennsylvania. Obviously all eyes on Pennsylvania sir. When they called [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=167.04s)]
*  Pennsylvania for Trump what's going through your mind? Relief, joy and maybe things will [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  get back to normal. Maybe we can afford whatever we want to buy again instead of $50 a bag for [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=183.44s)]
*  groceries. There you go. Ma'am what was your reaction when they called the race overall for, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  I'll go over here. She turned her back to me. She's mad at me. What was your reaction when [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=194.0s)]
*  they called the race for Trump overall? Oh without a doubt a sense of relief. My grandkids finally [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=198.16s)]
*  have a future. We've heard that phrase grandkids a lot. You said grandkids before. Why did you [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=203.04s)]
*  think immediately my grandkids are going to be better off because Trump won? All everyone's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=208.96s)]
*  grandchildren all over our country will be better because the economy, the parents can afford healthy [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=214.72s)]
*  good food instead of what the government wants to put into our children's food and call it healthy. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  When they called the race for Trump in Pennsylvania were you like it's over he's got this? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  Static, totally ecstatic. I started cheering in my living room. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=232.64s)]
*  Who else cheered in their living room when the results came down? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=237.68s)]
*  When this young lady walked in originally I said clearly you voted for Kamala and that was a joke. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=245.2s)]
*  That's a Todd Pyro witty humor. What was your reaction when you heard Trump won? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  Again relief because there's nobody in my opinion that can get things back the way they were four [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=255.36s)]
*  years ago as quickly as he can and do it properly. That's the vibe I love using that word of the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=263.28s)]
*  people here in Tyrone, Pennsylvania. We got to go now to Carly Shipkus, my esteemed colleague [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=271.52s)]
*  in North Carolina, but I'm very competitive. I want to beat Carly in the cheers department. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=276.72s)]
*  So Pennsylvania can we send a message to North Carolina? Let's go! [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=281.04s)]
*  Let's go! Let's go! It's good to see you from afar my friend Toddy. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=286.24s)]
*  We're gonna get a USA chant? You want to get a USA chant? You know it's interesting I've been [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=295.12s)]
*  talking to some of the diners and I'm noticing a trend. A lot of people saying that they didn't [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=300.0s)]
*  wake up to come here today. A lot of people just haven't gone to bed yet because they've been [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=303.68s)]
*  watching the returns come in. Who among you has not yet slept yet? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=307.76s)]
*  So there are some tired people but also very happy and energized by all the coffee. I want to talk [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=313.84s)]
*  to some of these diners here. This is Rick. He is the GOP chair of Haywood County, the county that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  we're in right now. Rick how are you feeling about a second Trump victory? Elated. And tell us why? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=322.96s)]
*  Why do you think he won? Why was he able to get across the finish line and so soon too? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=328.88s)]
*  A great organization and a mandate from God and a lot of hard work on the part of people like our [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=334.64s)]
*  volunteers here in Haywood County. So you think it's God's will and a lot of hard work. This is [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=341.92s)]
*  Mary Jane. Mary Jane what are some of your thoughts this morning on his victory? I'm thrilled. I'm so [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=348.64s)]
*  happy and it's amazing and I feel the same way Rick does. You know we're thankful to God for [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=354.0s)]
*  allowing this to happen. And North Carolina also voted for Donald Trump. Let's sit on over [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=360.72s)]
*  at this table with these lovely ladies. What was the most important issue to you? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=366.24s)]
*  The border crime, the economy and I think we need to help our military. Strength through, I mean [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=370.88000000000005s)]
*  defense through strength. Most of the military can't even meet their recruiting goals except [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=380.48s)]
*  the Marine Corps. And you think that those issues are the ones that want it for Donald Trump? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=387.36s)]
*  What about you? Pretty much the same thing. Stronger military is important to me. The border, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  unborn children's rights. Just sometimes we vote for things we're against more than we do things [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=400.24s)]
*  we're for. So a whole host of issues. That's so interesting. And aren't you surprised? Are you [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=409.36s)]
*  surprised that it was already called? We already know who the next president is going to be and we [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=415.28s)]
*  didn't think that was going to happen. Absolutely we didn't think so but we love it. We love everything [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=418.79999999999995s)]
*  he stands for and we're so anxious to have great leadership again. All right so that's a little bit [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=424.32s)]
*  of reaction from the fine folks of North Carolina. We're going to be covering the election results [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=429.84s)]
*  all morning long speaking to these wonderful people and getting reaction when Fox and Friends [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=435.2s)]
*  continues. Show to North Carolina now Carly is getting a free breakfast at Joey's Pancake House. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=440.48s)]
*  Hey yeah, welcome to Western North Carolina guys, USA. You know it was right around midnight when it [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=448.88s)]
*  was called that North Carolina went for Donald Trump awarding Donald Trump a big victory and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=459.92s)]
*  And Kamala Harris, a big blow by giving Donald Trump those 16 electoral votes that North [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=465.76s)]
*  Carolina has. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=469.76s)]
*  I'm going to have a great, great conversation with this table. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=470.76s)]
*  This is Jim, Ken and Laura. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=473.28s)]
*  We've been talking politics and actually you guys met, Ken and Laura are married and you [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=476.08s)]
*  met Jim by talking politics at diners just like this. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=481.0s)]
*  So we're going to get into these conversations that you've been having for years now. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=483.68s)]
*  So let's start with you, Jim. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=488.74s)]
*  What do you think about Donald Trump's second victory? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  How are you feeling about it this morning? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=494.66s)]
*  I was hoping. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=496.3s)]
*  I was, you know, praying and hoping he would get back in the White House and straighten [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=497.3s)]
*  this country out. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=500.86s)]
*  It's the first time I ever voted for somebody three times. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=501.86s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=504.26s)]
*  I think it's the first time if you voted for Trump in 2016, 2020 and 2024, that would be [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=505.26s)]
*  it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=510.42s)]
*  So what do you think are the issues, Laura, that want it for him? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=511.42s)]
*  Policy, definitely policy. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=513.82s)]
*  And I also voted for him all three times and it's always been based on policy for me. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=516.18s)]
*  And really quickly, we've been talking about policy versus personality, the authenticity [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=522.6999999999999s)]
*  that a lot of people feel Donald Trump has. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=527.1s)]
*  What do you think was the deciding factor for many people on the campaign trail seeing [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=529.4599999999999s)]
*  him campaign and what decided it for them for their vote to be to Donald Trump? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=532.6999999999999s)]
*  I think it was policy and authenticity. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=536.38s)]
*  It came through very clearly that she was not authentic and for whatever he is, he's [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=539.5799999999999s)]
*  authentic. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=544.14s)]
*  So there you have it guys. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=545.14s)]
*  So a little taste of what people are saying in Maggie Valley, North Carolina at Joey's [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=546.26s)]
*  Pancake House. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=552.02s)]
*  I'll send it back over to you guys at the desk. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmE8VM--tE&t=553.02s)]
