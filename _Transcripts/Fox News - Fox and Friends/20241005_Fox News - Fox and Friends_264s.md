# 'TRAVESTY': Helene recovery volunteer says situation 'way worse' than reported
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU)
*  Helene's death toll now hitting 232 people, making it the deadliest storm to hit the United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=0.0s)]
*  States since Hurricane Katrina. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=8.0s)]
*  And survivors say they've been forgotten by the government. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=10.32s)]
*  That's why our next guest has stepped up. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=13.68s)]
*  He's a veteran using his own helicopters to distribute supplies and help with search and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=15.08s)]
*  rescue. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=19.2s)]
*  Founder and CEO of Operator Solutions, Brandon Doherty joins us now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=20.2s)]
*  Brandon, great to have you on the program this morning. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=25.12s)]
*  We're hearing this story. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=28.48s)]
*  We're hearing the story over and over of private veteran groups, citizens stepping into this [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=29.72s)]
*  void, stepping into the chaos right now that is Western North Carolina and filling needs. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=35.24s)]
*  Tell us what you're experiencing, what you're doing there in North Carolina. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, well, what I can tell you is that it's a group of privately funded individuals. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=43.92s)]
*  You see a picture here of myself and Corey Mills, who is a congressman out of Florida. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=51.96s)]
*  He took it upon himself to fund our initial push into the area. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=57.68s)]
*  In fact, all the gas from our helicopter is put on his personal cart and he is backed [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=63.4s)]
*  up by Mercury One and several other organizations. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=68.36s)]
*  But this is completely privately funded. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=72.34s)]
*  These are private citizens that are helping out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=75.6s)]
*  And it's a shock to me, Will, because I spent my whole life rescuing American citizens overseas [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=78.88s)]
*  in combat. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=85.76s)]
*  And if we had somebody behind enemy lines, we would spare nothing, no expense to go and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=86.84s)]
*  get them. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=91.12s)]
*  And it is a travesty that there is not more folks helping out. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=92.12s)]
*  It's way worse than the media is reporting. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=96.12s)]
*  In fact, we have the ability because we have helicopters and hoists that we can get way [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  in behind where anybody else can fly into and we can hoist in and rescue people. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=102.36s)]
*  And there are a lot of affected people that nobody even knows about. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=108.2s)]
*  I would not be surprised if this death toll actually doubles. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=111.84s)]
*  I keep hearing that, Brandon, I keep hearing that even the images we get, it's not communicating [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=115.08s)]
*  the full extent to which this damage, this devastation has taken over Western North Carolina. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=120.28s)]
*  I have two specific things I want to ask you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=125.44s)]
*  From what I've been able to gather, a real problem is that last mile problem. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=127.92s)]
*  Some supplies can get close to maybe Asheville, but so many people live buried in the mountains [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=131.8s)]
*  on rural roads. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=136.88s)]
*  They're cut off from civilization and civilization is cut off from them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=138.04s)]
*  That's where your helicopters come in. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=142.36s)]
*  Have you guys been able to kind of breach some of that last mile getting these isolated people? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=144.04s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=150.2s)]
*  We flew in over 15,000 pounds of goods. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=151.2s)]
*  The folks up there, we've been getting them water, of course, but they don't really need [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  water. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=161.28s)]
*  They need generators. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=162.28s)]
*  They need Starlink. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=163.28s)]
*  They need space heaters. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=164.28s)]
*  It's going to be 30 degrees in the mountains next week. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=165.28s)]
*  These folks are sleeping under tarps. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=168.8s)]
*  They're extremely isolated. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=172.12s)]
*  Here's the deal. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=175.0s)]
*  Why are there not truckloads of the Army Corps of Engineers in there building roads, building [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=176.0s)]
*  bridges? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=182.72000000000003s)]
*  We are doing this, again, privately funded. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  Americans helping Americans, which is incredibly inspiring, but it's also incredibly disappointing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  because we're letting our American brothers and sisters down. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  Brandon, I have to ask you this really quickly. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=197.12s)]
*  I've seen some amazing reports, but I've had it confirmed to me and I've seen Elon Musk [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  tweet through this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  Did airspace get shut down by the Fed so all these private helicopters couldn't, could [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  no longer run these missions? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  And is it now back up? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=212.0s)]
*  Is that something you've experienced? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  Was it shut down? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  Is it up now? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  So, Will, I heard that as well. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  The only time it was shut down for us was on Wednesday. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=221.08s)]
*  I believe the president flew in and we all, rescue operations had to stop for two hours. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=225.12s)]
*  But then when the airspace opened back up, we were back in the game. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=231.88000000000002s)]
*  But as of like 7 p.m. last night when we flew our last mission, the airspace was still open. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=235.12s)]
*  I'm not sure how it is currently. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=240.52s)]
*  That's really glad to hear that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=242.84s)]
*  Appreciate what you're doing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=245.4s)]
*  I can speak to this personally. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=246.4s)]
*  Mercury One, which you're wearing on your chest, JP Decker, Glenn Beck, Corey Mills, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=247.68s)]
*  of course. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=252.32000000000002s)]
*  You guys are doing incredible work. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=253.32000000000002s)]
*  I want to know about it personally. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=254.56s)]
*  I want everyone to know watching. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=255.56s)]
*  There's incredible stuff going on. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=256.56s)]
*  And Brandon, you're a part of that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=258.52s)]
*  Thank you so much for what you're doing for fellow Americans. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=259.88s)]
*  Yeah, thank you and God bless. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJny8Si3RU&t=262.15999999999997s)]
