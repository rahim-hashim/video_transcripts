# Why this could be Abrego Garcia's 'worst nightmare'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI)
*  Alright, well we're going to move some news because anti-ice riots are breaking out across the country, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=0.0s)]
*  mostly from Los Angeles to New York where we're seeing the worst stuff. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=5.64s)]
*  Yesterday as protesters demonstrated against the ongoing operations. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=9.76s)]
*  The violence escalating as you can see in California as cars were set on fire, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=14.96s)]
*  officials dressed in riot gear used rubber bullets to disperse those crowds. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=19.76s)]
*  President Donald Trump is deploying 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles to combat the issue, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=24.88s)]
*  slamming Democratic leadership saying quote, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  we have an incompetent governor and mayor who were as usual unable to handle the task. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=32.44s)]
*  These radical left protests by instigators and often paid troublemakers will not be tolerated. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Meanwhile in New York nearly 150 protesters clashed with police there as well, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=45.96s)]
*  trying to block federal authorities from conducting immigration operations in lower Manhattan. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=51.64s)]
*  More than 20 people were arrested on that scene. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=68.64s)]
*  So let's bring in Fox News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=73.76s)]
*  Shannon it's great to see you this morning. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=77.56s)]
*  I'm glad to have your legal mind for some of these topics. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=79.44s)]
*  Let's start with what's going on in California. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=82.72s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom criticizing the activation of National Guard there after those ice protests turned violent. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  And of course, A.G. Pam Bondi says we will prosecute you writing on X. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=93.6s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you're a judge, a member of Congress or a protester in Los Angeles. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  If you obstruct or assault a law enforcement officer, this Department of Justice will prosecute you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=104.16s)]
*  Shannon, through your legal lens, what do you think of that? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=111.64s)]
*  So listen, the president has authority in a lot of situations to do what he's doing, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=114.36s)]
*  which is to mobilize the National Guard. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=118.88s)]
*  Now, usually that's done in conjunction with the governor of that particular state. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=120.6s)]
*  Clearly these two see this very differently. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=125.32s)]
*  We're told that they had about a 40 minute phone call, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=127.28s)]
*  Governor Newsom and the president to be a fly on the wall for that conversation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=130.12s)]
*  But what the governor has said publicly is we don't need this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=134.48s)]
*  This is inflammatory. We had this under control. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=137.32s)]
*  But what DHS said in an official statement yesterday on Saturday, they referred to what happened on Friday in L.A. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=139.68s)]
*  They said there were more than a thousand rioters there and they said there was all kinds of dangerous stuff happening. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=145.88s)]
*  There were attacks on their officers. There was damage. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=152.8s)]
*  They said it took two hours, this is according to DHS, for the LAPD to show up and help them. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=155.96s)]
*  So if Governor Newsom is going to say it's under control, our local and state officials and authorities are helping. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=160.72s)]
*  And DHS is saying, oh, no, we were kind of under siege for two hours before you guys showed up. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=166.56s)]
*  That's going to give President Trump what he feels like is the necessary authority to move forward. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=171.16s)]
*  So we spoke to Paul Morrow in a previous hour and he made a very interesting point. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=176.0s)]
*  You know, if these protesters get charged with local crimes, then the local DAs are just going to drop the charges. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=181.72s)]
*  How hard is it for them to figure out how to make charges, probably, I guess, federal charges that will definitely be prosecuted if they're levied? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=191.36s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that's where the warning from the attorney general comes in. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=204.56s)]
*  If you come after our officers, if you come after federal law enforcement officers, those are going to be federal charges. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=207.32s)]
*  And Paul makes such a great point, like he always makes great points, that if you have local authorities who don't want to be participating in this at all [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=213.12s)]
*  and they don't like what the feds are showing up and doing, you can count on almost zero prosecutions in a place like L.A. County. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  So it is important that the federal warning is there. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=226.24s)]
*  These are federal officers and that there's follow through from the feds, because if you're going after these officers [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=230.84s)]
*  who are trying to practice a legal authority that they have, and you guys have seen it, DHS has been putting out, ICE has been putting out, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=237.0s)]
*  telling us who these people are they're trying to go after. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=245.28s)]
*  And there are a lot of really bad people that are involved in these sweeps. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=248.52s)]
*  And I can't imagine any people in these communities, including the ones that are protesting, want those specific individuals, rapists, murders, child predators. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=251.64s)]
*  They don't want them in their community. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=259.6s)]
*  So give ICE some room to get to those people, because those are the real targets in these raids. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=261.20000000000005s)]
*  You know, Shannon, the poster boy for the bad hombres that Donald Trump wants to kick out of our country, who are here illegally, is Obrego Garcia. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=267.6s)]
*  And so this is what NBC spoke to Donald Trump about the criminal charges for Obrego, Kilmar Obrego Garcia. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=278.32000000000005s)]
*  And here is what President Trump told NBC. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=286.72s)]
*  He said that it wasn't his decision to bring Obrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=289.88s)]
*  Was this NBC saying this? I'm sorry. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=298.96s)]
*  President Trump on Saturday said that it wasn't his decision to bring Kilmar Obrego Garcia, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=301.56s)]
*  a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, back to the U.S. to face federal charges, saying that, you know, he thinks that this man is clearly guilty. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=306.36s)]
*  He says it's he decided to do it that way. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=316.64s)]
*  And that's fine. If the if the judges want to do it that way, it should be a very easy case for federal prosecutors, he says. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=319.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the indictment is out there. People can read it for themselves. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=326.84s)]
*  And what was so interesting to me is, gosh, there was a lot more than we knew that was going on under the surface with this investigation and what DOJ was putting together. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=330.2s)]
*  We had all seen that video of the traffic stop in Tennessee from a couple of years ago. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=338.52s)]
*  But to see what they've put together, this indictment came down May 21st. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=343.88s)]
*  And apparently, once his story got out there, they were able to connect to a lot of other people because this indictment alleges all kinds of co-conspirators that he made more than a hundred of these trips trafficking. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=348.04s)]
*  They allege not only humans, women, children, gang members, guns, narcotics. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=358.2s)]
*  I mean, if there is testimony to back all of that up, this is this guy's worst nightmare, because not only did you get deported to a country that you didn't want to go to, you are from there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=363.36s)]
*  But now you're back and you may spend, if you're convicted, a lot of time in a U.S. prison and then get deported again. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=372.48s)]
*  So the allegations are very broad. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=379.56s)]
*  This is not a one time we got you on that stop in Tennessee. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=382.48s)]
*  That's it. The allegations go far, far beyond that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZYy6UqAuI&t=385.48s)]
