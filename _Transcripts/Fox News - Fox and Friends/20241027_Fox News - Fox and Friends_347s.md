# HE 'BUILT THAT CITY': Eric Trump on New York's enthusiasm ahead of father's MSG rally
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI)
*  Well, joining us now to preview his dad's historic rally [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=0.0s)]
*  and speech here in his hometown of New York City [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=3.56s)]
*  is Eric Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Eric, good morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=6.44s)]
*  Morning. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=7.36s)]
*  Hey guys, good morning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=9.08s)]
*  Great to be on. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=10.32s)]
*  So, obviously Eric, a new venue, New York City, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=11.16s)]
*  Madison Square Garden, big roster on guest list of speakers. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=14.8s)]
*  What do you, what should we expect will be different [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=19.92s)]
*  about what your dad has to say or the message [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=23.38s)]
*  or even just the symbolism of the rally today [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=25.96s)]
*  in New York City versus perhaps one [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=28.78s)]
*  that someone might see somewhere else in America? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=30.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=33.980000000000004s)]
*  Well, I think there's tremendous symbolism, right? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=35.08s)]
*  I mean, this is a guy who built [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=36.54s)]
*  the entire New York City skyline. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=37.5s)]
*  He spent his entire career doing that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=39.24s)]
*  The entire city is littered with buildings [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=41.22s)]
*  that have Trump on it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=43.82s)]
*  And he's a man that deeply loves New York. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=44.7s)]
*  I'm a person who deeply loves New York City. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=47.22s)]
*  And guys, I grew up in that building. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=49.5s)]
*  I grew up in Madison Square Garden. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=51.38s)]
*  I went to every ranger game with my father, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=52.82s)]
*  all the Knicks games. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=54.5s)]
*  I made countless concerts. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=55.34s)]
*  And to see him on stage in really, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=56.66s)]
*  maybe the darkest blue area of the country, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=60.22s)]
*  but with that kind of enthusiasm [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=63.26s)]
*  that you're seeing right there is, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=64.82s)]
*  I don't think there's anything [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=66.82s)]
*  that could be more meaningful to us. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=67.94s)]
*  I mean, this country's got a lot of problems. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=69.46s)]
*  You guys talk about them all the time. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=71.25999999999999s)]
*  And New York, a city that we love, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=72.74s)]
*  has a lot of problems as well. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=74.19999999999999s)]
*  And there's no family in the world. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=75.78s)]
*  As much as they've come after us, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=77.94s)]
*  as much as they've tried to attack us, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=79.19999999999999s)]
*  as much as they've weaponized lawfare in that city [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=80.86s)]
*  against us, frankly, forcing us to leave, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=83.22s)]
*  there's no family in the world [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=85.78s)]
*  that wants better for New York than us. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=87.18s)]
*  We adore that city. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=90.5s)]
*  We love that city. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=91.52s)]
*  We grew up in that city. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=92.52s)]
*  My father and our family afterward built that city, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=93.7s)]
*  and so much of that city, so many great icons. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=97.86s)]
*  You guys know them all because you're there all the time. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=100.42s)]
*  But to me, it's gonna be a really sentimental night [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=103.7s)]
*  going and watching my father on that stage. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=105.34s)]
*  I'll speak right before him. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=107.42s)]
*  And we really look forward to this as a family, guys. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=109.18s)]
*  This is definitely a meaningful one for us. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=112.9s)]
*  We built this city. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=115.3s)]
*  I'm just taking back to the 80s, Erica. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=116.94s)]
*  I can't help it from that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=119.02s)]
*  You know, we were just talking, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=122.17999999999999s)]
*  as Carly was speaking to so many of those people [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=123.46s)]
*  and saying, there's just no way Kamala Harris [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=125.58s)]
*  could get this kind of enthusiasm 10, 12 hours before. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=128.7s)]
*  And then you talk about all the negative things [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=132.7s)]
*  that are being said. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=135.01999999999998s)]
*  You see the left ramping up attacks, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=135.85999999999999s)]
*  Hitler and fascism and everything else. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=138.9s)]
*  It's gonna be incredible to come back to New York City [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=142.06s)]
*  after everything that Donald Trump [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=144.6s)]
*  and your family has been through, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=146.28s)]
*  the president and your family has been through, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  and then have that kind of a reception. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=150.1s)]
*  I mean, just kind of talk to me about what that means. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=152.32s)]
*  Yeah, guys, I mean, the love in New York is incredible. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=156.84s)]

*  who were just speaking and the love [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=161.88s)]
*  and kind of the toughness, right? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK2xtfZRgQI&t=163.51999999999998s)]
