# ‘SAVE THE SYSTEM’: Treasury secretary contender on how to reinstate ‘fair’ trade
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ)
*  President-elect Trump is rolling out his cabinet and top staff positions at a rapid pace, but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=0.0s)]
*  there's still a spot open for Treasury Secretary. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=6.0s)]
*  Our next guest is emerging as a possible pick, leading the list of those up for the job. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=9.64s)]
*  He wrote a recent op-ed echoing Trump's love of tariffs. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=16.2s)]
*  He points out that it was a favorite tool of America's first Treasury Secretary, Alexander [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=20.46s)]
*  Hamilton. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=25.32s)]
*  Scott Besant is CEO and founder of Key Square Capital Management, and he joins us now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=26.52s)]
*  Scott, welcome. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=32.48s)]
*  So Donald Trump obviously- [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=34.12s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=35.6s)]
*  Great to see you too. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=36.96s)]
*  So obviously Donald Trump, a fan of tariffs, you are too. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=37.96s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=41.68s)]
*  Explain that to us. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=42.68s)]
*  Well, Rachel, I've been in the investment business 35 years, and Donald Trump is the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=44.32s)]
*  sophisticated leader on economics that I've met, and he's also the most open-minded. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=52.08s)]
*  So the idea of bringing back tariffs, Alexander Hamilton was the original tariff man, and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=59.08s)]
*  why did he like tariffs? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=64.84s)]
*  Two reasons. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  One, to fund the Treasury. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  Two, to protect nascent U.S. industries. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=69.6s)]
*  And Donald Trump has added a third leg to the stool, and it's for negotiating leverage. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=72.78s)]
*  Why did we put away this great policy tool for so many years? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=79.62s)]
*  President Trump has such an open mind. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  Imagine he's endorsing crypto, that he's pushing this agenda. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=89.66s)]
*  The Iranians were putting maximum pressure on the Iranians. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=101.02s)]
*  I say, let's make America great again, let's make Iran broke again. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=105.58s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=110.14s)]
*  Well, also, it appears that tariffs is a tool to get eventually to free trade, which is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=111.14s)]
*  what we really want, but really, honestly free trade. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=116.02s)]
*  By the way, here's the- [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=119.66s)]
*  Yeah, but Rachel, what we really want is fair trade. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=120.66s)]
*  Fair trade, exactly. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=124.98s)]
*  Xi Jinping, Xi Jinping yesterday gave a speech talking about the international trading system [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=125.98s)]
*  and talking about how great it is, and free trade is great. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=132.89999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's worked great for the Chinese, so of course he's done that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=135.94s)]
*  China is the most imbalanced economy in the world, so he's extolling the values of it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=139.94s)]
*  So we've got to save the system. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  We have got to get back to fair trade. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=148.2s)]
*  We'll have our producers put up what Donald Trump's tariff plan looks like right now on [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=151.26s)]
*  the screen. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=156.89999999999998s)]
*  After this race for the, you know, or this competition for the Treasury Secretary, you [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=157.9s)]
*  have been, several Wall Street legends have called on your behalf, heavy hitters in Silicon [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=164.06s)]
*  Valley, Coach Tommy Tuberville, Larry Kudlow, Art Laffer, Steve Moore, so some really serious [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=169.46s)]
*  financial people and who understand our economy and know that we need someone at the helm [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=177.22s)]
*  when things go bad, who really knows what they're doing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=182.06s)]
*  Why are they supporting you? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=185.06s)]
*  Well, it's not about supporting me. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=188.02s)]
*  It's about the cabinet that President Trump's going to create. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=191.38s)]
*  And Donald Trump has been so correct on his policies. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=195.26s)]
*  And the past few months, I have had the chance to travel with President Trump. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  We were at a barbershop in the Bronx, and then I recently sat in a meeting with he and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=205.66s)]
*  Elon Musk on this new, the Efficiency Commission. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=211.68s)]
*  Like, who else could do that? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=216.36s)]
*  You know, from both sides loving, the people loving the richest man in the world. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=219.28s)]
*  It's very exciting that we are going to bring the Silicon Valley solutions into government. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=225.12s)]
*  Yes or no, really quick. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  And make things work. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=234.72s)]
*  Yes or no, really quick. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  The main competition for this job between you and this other person, did they give a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  million dollars to Hillary Clinton? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=241.28s)]
*  I'm taking the high road. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=246.48s)]
*  And, you know, I've been a big supporter of President Trump. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=248.68s)]
*  I've known the Trump family for 30 years. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=251.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=254.08s)]
*  And we'll go from there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=255.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=257.08s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=258.08s)]
*  Scott Besson, up for Treasury Secretary. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=259.08s)]
*  Best of luck to him. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=261.08s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LKd8FH3MQ&t=271.28s)]
