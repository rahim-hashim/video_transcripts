# Kamala Harris is ‘woke writ-large’: Charles Gasparino
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg)
*  Well, on this program, we've been telling you about America's major corporations fully [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=0.0s)]
*  embracing a woke DEI agenda. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=6.68s)]
*  Here's another one. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=9.64s)]
*  Delta Airlines pushing its vision back in 2021 suggesting ladies and gentlemen saying [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=10.64s)]
*  making that announcement at the gate may not be inclusive enough. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=17.04s)]
*  So we're beginning to take a hard look at things like our gatehouse announcements. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=22.32s)]
*  You know, we welcome ladies and gentlemen and we've asked ourselves is that as gender [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=26.4s)]
*  inclusive as we want to be? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=29.88s)]
*  You know, we're looking at some legacy language that exists in some of our employee manuals [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=31.84s)]
*  and getting to the root of the way some things are described and saying, does that actually [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  send a message of inclusivity? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=40.56s)]
*  Fox Business correspondent Charlie Gasparino is the author of a new book, Go Woke, Go [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=44.68s)]
*  Broke, and he joins us now to react. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=51.56s)]
*  Hey, ladies and gentlemen, how are you today? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=52.56s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=54.4s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=55.4s)]
*  You use ladies plural and gentlemen singular. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=56.4s)]
*  I don't know what you're doing over here, Charlie. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  By the way, now I know why they say hey you to me when I fly Delta. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  I never knew it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=65.24s)]
*  I thought they were just being jerks. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=66.24s)]
*  But they say hey you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=67.24s)]
*  You know, I feel like anything I say about this topic is going to get me in trouble. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=69.12s)]
*  But as you know, I've just wrote a new book. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=73.08s)]
*  It's called Go Woke, Go Broke, and we should show the book just while I speak, please. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=75.6s)]
*  We'll dial a button here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=82.4s)]
*  But you know, it is infuriating. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=85.68s)]
*  It is stupid. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=88.84s)]
*  I mean, my book essentially is one dopey tale after another of corporate idiocy involving [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=89.84s)]
*  woke- there it is, of corporate wokeness. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=97.12s)]
*  But aside from the idiocy of not saying ladies and gentlemen and some of the stupid stuff [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=100.44000000000001s)]
*  that goes on with wokeness in the workplace, this does seep into serious stuff. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=104.54s)]
*  I mean, let's be real clear. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  If you're going to apply- DEI is diversity, equity, inclusion is a central part of corporate [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=112.8s)]
*  wokeness. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=117.64s)]
*  If you're going to apply that strictly across all jobs at Delta, well then you're going [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=118.64s)]
*  to get airline pilots that are picked not necessarily for their skill, but based on [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=124.44s)]
*  their racial or their gender classification. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=129.8s)]
*  And it's a scary thing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=134.36s)]
*  And I go through this in great detail in the book. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  There is a rebellion against this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=140.16s)]
*  You know, if you notice, she said this thing back in 2021. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't think she'd make a stupid statement like that now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=145.44s)]
*  Although I noticed in the Fox News article, they didn't deny it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=148.72s)]
*  They kind of like kind of tried to spin it a certain way. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  But the American people hate this stuff. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=157.16s)]
*  And you know, that's the last third of my book is essentially the rebellion against [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=158.88s)]
*  it, whether it's at Budweiser after the Dylan Mulvaney flap, whether it's Disney gratuitously [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=163.11999999999998s)]
*  putting same sex kissing scenes into cartoons, whether it's BlackRock demanding ESG out of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=168.44s)]
*  its portfolio companies. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=174.72s)]
*  People are running away from this. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=176.36s)]
*  And I guess if we're going to go meta here, Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  candidate, has said we need more wokeness. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  She said it's a quote. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=185.68s)]
*  I'm paraphrasing, but she basically touted wokeness as a big part of her political appeal. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=187.08s)]
*  The American consumer has rejected wokeness. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=194.12s)]
*  I wonder if the American voter will reject wokeness because she is woke writ large and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=196.8s)]
*  she's by the way, she's the tip of the spear of wokeness. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=203.08s)]
*  If you if you listen to her rhetoric. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=205.68s)]
*  Well, Delta gave a statement to us on this and it said Delta encourages our people to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=207.36s)]
*  use language that is inclusive of everyone as our global customer base includes a broad [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  range of diversity in cultural backgrounds, identity and experiences. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  So they're not backing away from it, Charlie. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=222.44s)]
*  And the other person running for president, Donald Trump, he says everything woke goes [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=225.56s)]
*  to and you can just fill in the blank. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=231.4s)]
*  So we've got quite a contrast going into the election. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=233.16s)]
*  I can't imagine what he said. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=236.72s)]
*  But. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=237.72s)]
*  Well, I mean, listen, it is stupid and he's absolutely right. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=240.0s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump, you know, shoots from the hip. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=243.32s)]
*  He can be crass sometimes and turn some people off. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=245.72s)]
*  I find it refreshing that someone actually speaks his mind in politics once in a while. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=248.2s)]
*  That that being said, you know, the numbers on wokeness are not good. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=253.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, is Kamala Harris really going to run on it? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=257.88s)]
*  I mean, again, Dylan Mulvaney appeared as a trans woman activist, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=261.04s)]
*  in a in a in a Budweiser commercial, a media spot in twenty twenty three, early twenty [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=267.08s)]
*  twenty three. It's part of their DEI movement to DEI, their their influencers. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=272.44s)]
*  And when that when people saw that and the and were repulsed by it, I mean, this is a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=278.4s)]
*  trans woman in a bubble bath in a, you know, in a very off brand for Budweiser. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=282.96s)]
*  The company, but in my life became was number one beer went to number three and it's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=288.23999999999995s)]
*  still losing ground. So you tell me you want to run on that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't know why companies go there. It's stupid. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=296.76s)]
*  But I'm glad they do because they gave me stuff to write about. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  They are. Well, we've got to leave it right there. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=300.96s)]
*  The book is Go Woke, Go Broke. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=303.52s)]
*  Check it out. Makes the definitive case. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=305.2s)]
*  We appreciate your time this morning, Charlie. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjPD8ujJ-Fg&t=306.92s)]
