# City council cuts mic off Alabama resident while voicing concerns over migrants
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo)
*  An Alabama City Council meeting was shut down after residents voiced their concerns over a recent influx of Haitian migrants [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=0.0s)]
*  Here to react David Phillips who was at that meeting and an Alabama Republican mayoral candidate for that town Brian Taunton [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=21.72s)]
*  Welcome to you both fellas Philip. Let me start with you. You're the guy who was at that podium [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=28.28s)]
*  You were asking questions about what's going on in town to your City Council who should be responsive to you [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=32.96s)]
*  Why'd they cut your mic? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=38.96s)]
*  That's what I was wondering at the time [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=42.84s)]
*  You know, that was the section of the meeting that's open to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=45.42s)]
*  public comment [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=49.24s)]
*  So when I stepped to the mic I had a few questions for them and they basically shut it down [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  Excuse me before I could even voice really any of the questions that I had [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=56.32s)]
*  I think it was more of the fact that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=60.92s)]
*  They really didn't want to give the answers more than they didn't have the answers. Okay [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=64.04s)]
*  You know as I mentioned [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=71.04s)]
*  In other statements, that's the whole point that the podium and the mic are theirs. So the public can you know? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=74.16s)]
*  Ask the questions they have it's why the City Council has a job to answer questions [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=81.12s)]
*  The city have Brian tell us about what's going on. You've got a small town there and you've got a potential problem [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=86.04s)]
*  It sounds like with migrants coming in what's going on? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=93.0s)]
*  Well, we do have a problem. But first I'd like to say thank you for having us here this morning to discuss this but [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=96.44s)]
*  The problem is much bigger than we are. We're a small town of 12,000 people and I [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=103.2s)]
*  While I appreciate Dave's Dave's comment. The bottom line is this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=109.64s)]
*  We're not equipped to deal with this our City Council and all in small town governments across the the US are not [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  Equipped to deal with this problem. We shouldn't Dave shouldn't have even had to be at that meeting to have this discussion [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=122.72s)]
*  Our City Council is not prepared to have this kind of discussion. We've all been called [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=129.96s)]
*  flat-footed on this and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=136.16s)]
*  Bottom line is this falls back on a failed immigration policy of the Biden-Harris administration and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  the failure failures of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=144.92s)]
*  Alejandro Mayorkas [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=147.6s)]
*  and Homeland Security [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=149.6s)]
*  We should not be dealing with these issues [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=151.44s)]
*  But we're being forced to and we simply do not have the infrastructure to support them [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=153.92s)]
*  And this is what Dave and others in our city are afraid of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=159.24s)]
*  These people have not been properly vetted and they very well [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=163.68s)]
*  I believe they are [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=167.04s)]
*  Wonderful people. Yeah, but they have many have been simply recruited into the United States by [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  outside sources and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=174.64s)]
*  That comes with some some major major issues [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=177.16s)]
*  But like I said, we look at what's happening in America and we don't have the resources [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=180.04s)]
*  We're already stretched out as a small community [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=185.72s)]
*  Yeah, and you're asking questions that anyone would ask in their town things have changed. Why have they changed? Are we safe? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=188.32s)]
*  What are you doing about it City Council? Do you think you're right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=195.04s)]
*  It's probably much more of a national issue than it is that particular City Council in your town, Alabama [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  We got to leave it there Brian and David. Thanks for being with us. Good to see you [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=203.45999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you and we reached out to that City Council for comment. We have not heard back. I'm Steve Ducey [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwUxtT3jfo&t=207.72s)]
