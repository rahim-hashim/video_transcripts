# Doocy: This could be a real headache for House Speaker Johnson
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk)
*  Okay, so this hour's lead story on Capitol Hill today, the House Doge Caucus Department [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=0.0s)]
*  of Government Efficiency is holding its first ever meeting with lawmakers. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=5.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump met with TikTok CEO ahead of the impending US [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=10.08s)]
*  ban on the Chinese owned app. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  If it fails to find a new parent company, I think they have a month to do this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=17.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=21.2s)]
*  I know there's some there's some suitors. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=22.2s)]
*  Peter Deuce, he joins us from Washington. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=23.76s)]
*  Peter. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=25.6s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=26.6s)]
*  The only CEO with the most to gain from a Mar-a-Lago meeting is Xiao Chu. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=27.6s)]
*  He runs TikTok and unless it's Chinese owners sell it, TikTok is banned here in the US, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  January 19th. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  But on January 20th, Donald Trump can extend the deadline for that sale. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=38.36s)]
*  And it sounds like he's open to it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=43.8s)]
*  We'll take a look at TikTok. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  You know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won Youth by 34 points. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  And there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=55.48s)]
*  TikTok had an impact. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=60.16s)]
*  And so we're taking a look at it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=61.36s)]
*  But you know, we won Youth. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=63.67999999999999s)]
*  Republicans are always 30 points down in Youth. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=65.44s)]
*  Remember, the TikTok ban has to do with bipartisan concerns that the Chinese owners are mining [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=68.36s)]
*  data from US users to use for reasons unknown. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=74.56s)]
*  Another very interesting dynamic to consider here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=78.84s)]
*  TikTok is a main competitor to X owned by Trump's new pal, Elon Musk. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=81.88s)]
*  Trump really seems to value Musk's opinion on things. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=87.28s)]
*  We don't know what kind of influence Musk has here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  Musk's Doge is the talk of the next Congress and Congresswoman Victoria Sparks, Republican [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=93.44s)]
*  from Indiana, is so moved by the idea of reforming the federal government that she's going to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=99.08s)]
*  do just that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=104.72s)]
*  Just Doge. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=106.6s)]
*  She told Speaker Johnson she does not want to be on any committees anymore. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=107.6s)]
*  She's not going to participate in anything with the caucus. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=111.48s)]
*  Just Doge Sparks says that she is still going to be a registered Republican, but it could [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=115.0s)]
*  still be a real headache for a House Speaker, Mike Johnson, who just has a one seat majority [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=119.68s)]
*  as is. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, only because the other seats have to be filled with special elections, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  So what do we have? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=132.28s)]
*  Waltz, we have Lee Stefanik, and so Gates. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=133.28s)]
*  So you have those three seats. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=137.84s)]
*  So that's that's far that that they'll expand a little bit. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  And it sounds like there are some ways that Trump can manipulate the math a little bit [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=143.36s)]
*  more. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=147.08s)]
*  There is talk that he could pull somebody like Jared Moskovitz, the Democrat from Florida, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=148.08s)]
*  to run one of the federal agencies here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  FEMA. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  That would be smart. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  So Peter, going back to your other topic today on TikTok, you know, over the last couple [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  of years, we've heard about security concerns and stuff like that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  But so many lawmakers and a lot of Republicans and Donald Trump himself use TikTok. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  And he was talking about it yesterday at Mar-a-Lago about how TikTok helped him, he presumes, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  with young people. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=178.92s)]
*  Is there a possibility they could actually say, we know we've been against it for a long [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=180.56s)]
*  time, but now you know what? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  Maybe it's not so bad. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=186.6s)]
*  It just depends on who they're listening to. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=188.16s)]
*  Senator that he wants to be his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was one of the most [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=190.8s)]
*  anti-TikTok voices in Congress over the last couple of years. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=194.08s)]
*  And the concerns that just kind of shuffling the chairs in the boardroom with a Beijing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=199.32s)]
*  owned parent company is not going to do anything to change the fact that they might be mining [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=206.2s)]
*  data from U.S. users who have this app downloaded on their phone. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  What we were led to believe over the last couple of months when they passed this bill [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=217.96s)]
*  with a bipartisan majority is that as soon as you download it, they can see anything [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=220.84s)]
*  in your phone if they want to. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=226.56s)]
*  That has not changed and it will not change. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  It's not going to allay the concerns of the people who voted on this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=231.32s)]
*  Peter, here's the thing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=234.0s)]
*  You have that stealing our data. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=235.72s)]
*  The other thing is the news. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=238.0s)]
*  Most young people are getting the news from TikTok. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=240.0s)]
*  They have a great algorithm. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  They have a great business plan. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  But try to find some pro-Israel stories on the timeline on the news feed for TikTok. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=244.24s)]
*  Now if the tariffs go against China, you watch slowly but surely a lot of the pro-tariff [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  talk will take a lower profile to the anti-tariff talk because it goes to China. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=256.0s)]
*  Do you want China controlling the number one news feed for the next generation of Americans? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=262.72s)]
*  And Brian, I heard something so interesting over the last couple of weeks. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  Everybody that I know who works in the Intel realm discounted the possibility right away [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=271.82s)]
*  that the drones could be controlled by China. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=278.08s)]
*  And the argument was, why would the Chinese need to surveil the U.S. with drones when [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=281.36s)]
*  they have TikTok and they can see everything? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=286.65999999999997s)]
*  They're watching from our pocket. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=289.06s)]
*  You know, Peter, when your dad was interviewing the drone guy out on Fox Square a few days [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=291.5s)]
*  ago at the end of last week, he was in the green room and he was talking to me and he [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=296.42s)]
*  said, they can see everything. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=299.38s)]
*  Everything we buy on Amazon, that's from China, they can put devices in it, chips in it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=301.5s)]
*  They can put anything in it, just buy on us. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=307.48s)]
*  And he said they know everything that we're doing, including the drones we buy on Amazon. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=309.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=314.02s)]
*  And yes to all of that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=315.02s)]
*  And all of that to say it would be a, it would not sit well with a lot of elected Republicans [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=318.14s)]
*  if Trump reverses on the TikTok, forcing TikTok to be sold. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=325.3s)]
*  What are they going to say about it publicly? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=330.94s)]
*  Because everything else they've said over the last couple months, or since the election, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  is that he was just elected with a mandate. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=338.42s)]
*  We need to at least give him a chance to do things the way that he wants to do. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=341.22s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=344.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=345.94s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=346.94s)]
*  You know, and we've been talking over the last couple of weeks and months now about [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=347.94s)]
*  the mandate, but also we're realizing that Donald Trump is in the midst of a honeymoon [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=352.5s)]
*  period like we haven't seen before. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=358.98s)]
*  His I was looking at morning consult. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump just hit the highest net favorability rating since April of 2017. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=365.18s)]
*  That's right after he took office. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=370.22s)]
*  A majority of people approve of how he's handling the transition and surveys show the people [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=371.66s)]
*  feel broadly warmer about Trump than they did over the last two elections. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=376.82s)]
*  And it's not just the rank and file people, average Americans, it's people with the biggest [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=381.26s)]
*  wallets in the world because they realize, you know, that old expression, if you can't [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=387.46000000000004s)]
*  beat him, join him. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=392.18s)]
*  Well, they might not have voted for him in the past, but now they're voting for him [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=393.34000000000003s)]
*  by supporting his transition and trying to make it effective because whatever he does [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=398.14000000000004s)]
*  impacts them. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=404.08000000000004s)]
*  Yesterday I was I filled in on outnumbered and we were watching this presser of Donald [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=405.58000000000004s)]
*  Trump. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=411.38s)]
*  It was more than an hour. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=412.38s)]
*  It was so good. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=413.38s)]
*  It was his first. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=414.38s)]
*  He was charming. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=415.38s)]
*  He really was. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=416.38s)]
*  He was the first president of the United States to have a conference since being elected [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=418.38s)]
*  the second time. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=423.38s)]
*  And he covered so many different topics from the drones to the CEOs that want to meet with [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=424.38s)]
*  him. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=430.9s)]
*  He talked about how all these CEOs and individuals, which I think is smart on the CEO's parts, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=431.9s)]
*  want to come to Mar-a-Lago and be his friend. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=436.38s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  How was your meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook and did you talk about tariffs in that meeting? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  I had dinner with Tim Cook. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=447.41999999999996s)]
*  I had dinner with sort of almost all of them and the rest are coming. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=449.5s)]
*  And this is one of the big differences, I think, between we were talking about it before. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=454.97999999999996s)]
*  One of the big differences between the first term and the first term everybody was fighting [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=460.21999999999997s)]
*  me. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=464.46s)]
*  In this term everybody wants to be my friend. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=465.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=467.38s)]
*  My personality changed or something. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=468.38s)]
*  I had, as you know, Sundar from Google, but I also had Sergey. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=470.86s)]
*  And we do have Jeff Bezos, Amazon coming in sometime during the week. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=476.78s)]
*  And yet, of course, Elon Musk, another business titan. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=483.1s)]
*  And then you have people like David Sachs, who's going to be head of crypto and he's [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=486.94s)]
*  going to be head of AI. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=492.46s)]
*  And he worked with them the whole time. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=494.1s)]
*  So they definitely want to influence, they want to say in it, but they have a peer that [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=495.98s)]
*  understands their business, started a series of companies, turned into billion dollar success [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=499.78s)]
*  stories beginning, but not ending with PayPal. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=503.97999999999996s)]
*  And then you have people that just want to be a part of it. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=507.09999999999997s)]
*  They don't want to be left out. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=509.85999999999996s)]
*  And I also think that they want to, and I might be naive, but I also think they want [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=511.14s)]
*  to help the country. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=517.22s)]
*  And I think they see this as an opportunity to help the country without being put into [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=518.22s)]
*  an ideological box. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=522.1s)]
*  Because this president is so different than a typical Republican or Democrat. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=524.14s)]
*  He splits the differences on a lot of issues and the party follows him. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=529.66s)]
*  And the other thing is, I think on some level in 2016, a lot of these titans thought that [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=533.74s)]
*  they could have done the same thing. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=538.26s)]
*  They're almost kicking themselves. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=539.42s)]
*  If Trump could have won, I could have won. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=540.5799999999999s)]
*  And then now they're seeing what he went through, what he's done, the crowds that he got, the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=542.5799999999999s)]
*  popularity that he has, getting the popular vote, and then what he was able to do through [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=548.6999999999999s)]
*  being assassinated twice and thought, you know what, they couldn't have done that. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=552.98s)]
*  And maybe I should just dive in. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=556.78s)]
*  And Elon Musk, I think, made it cool. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=558.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, to the point about the honeymoon not only with the Americans, but also with Silicon [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=561.06s)]
*  Valley, for the most part, none of the tech companies supported Trump in 2016. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=565.86s)]
*  None of them. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=571.98s)]
*  And so his point when he says everybody wants to be my friend is they're realizing the importance [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=572.98s)]
*  of being close to the president of the United States. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=577.0799999999999s)]
*  And that is why, one of the reasons why, all these tech companies are now each donating [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=578.9s)]
*  a million dollars to Donald Trump's inauguration. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=583.74s)]
*  You've got a million from Amazon, a million from Metta, OpenAI's Sam Altman gave a million, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=586.9s)]
*  and so did Perplexity. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=592.42s)]
*  Donating to an inaugural fund doesn't really ultimately get you noticed much, but if you [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=594.9399999999999s)]
*  don't donate, that gets you noticed. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=599.5799999999999s)]
*  It's like, hey, why didn't we get any money from these people? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=602.1s)]
*  I looked into it, and you know, so they're all given a million dollars this time. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=605.78s)]
*  For Biden, you know how much Google gave? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=610.54s)]
*  300,000. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=613.42s)]
*  Microsoft, half a million. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=614.74s)]
*  Amazon, about a quarter of a million. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=616.34s)]
*  So in other words, they're giving so much more money to Donald Trump, maybe it's little [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=618.14s)]
*  penance, maybe they want to have a really big party. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=622.86s)]
*  It's called the inaugural fund. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=625.74s)]
*  What does that money go to? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=627.14s)]
*  What does it pay for? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=628.46s)]
*  To pay for everything. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=629.46s)]
*  For the organization, for the organization. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=630.46s)]
*  So for the parties, it's not for the administration, it's not for just for that night. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=631.46s)]
*  But you remember this. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=637.62s)]
*  This is, and you talk about the amount of investigations. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=638.62s)]
*  They started investigating the inaugural fund, remember? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=641.4200000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=644.74s)]
*  Tom Perot? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=646.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=647.14s)]
*  They said, what happened with this? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=648.14s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=649.14s)]
*  I'm thinking to myself, two and a half years later, the Democrats were doing an investigation [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=650.14s)]
*  on where that money's coming from and how it was used. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=652.46s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5wURbEcZk&t=654.78s)]
