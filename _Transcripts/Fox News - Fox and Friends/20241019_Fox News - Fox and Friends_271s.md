# 'NO PATH FOR HARRIS': Losing key voting bloc could spell doom for Dems, Michigan Republican warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8)
*  Today, early voting begins in Detroit and both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are making [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=0.0s)]
*  their pitch to voters in the all-important battleground state of Michigan. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=5.4s)]
*  In this election, everything we have fought for, for years in this movement, in this movement [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=11.36s)]
*  for unions and for labor is on the line. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=20.56s)]
*  Donald Trump's track record is a disaster for working people. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=23.68s)]
*  And he is, I believe, an existential threat to America's labor movement. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=27.58s)]
*  I am proclaiming to the people of this state that by the end of my term, the entire world [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=32.339999999999996s)]
*  will be talking about the Michigan miracle and the stunning rebirth of Detroit. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=38.22s)]
*  Joining us now is former Michigan GOP gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=45.099999999999994s)]
*  Tudor, great to see you this morning. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=48.54s)]
*  Thanks for getting up early with us. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=50.18s)]
*  Tell us what you think the state of play is right now in Michigan. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=52.94s)]
*  Well, you guys have been talking about it all morning. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=57.06s)]
*  Not only is it your freedom of religion, but you also have the EV mandates. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=59.339999999999996s)]
*  And we just had Crane's business report last week that Stellantis is talking to Whitmer [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=64.56s)]
*  because they are looking at moving their headquarters out of the state of Michigan. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=69.66s)]
*  Can you imagine Ford, Dodge, Ram and Chrysler moving out of the state of Michigan? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=73.9s)]
*  That would just be devastating to the auto workers. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=81.02s)]
*  This is a ridiculous situation that we're in under the Biden, Harris and Whitmer regime. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=83.58s)]
*  And that's all because of EV mandates. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=90.06s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=92.38s)]
*  Well, you said something really interesting about how they're telling you, you can drive [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=93.38s)]
*  whatever you want, but the mandates tell you something different. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=96.98s)]
*  And that's Alyssa Slotkin is also doing that here in the state of Michigan. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=100.1s)]
*  You noted that she had Trump in her ads. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=103.98s)]
*  She's running for Senate. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=106.7s)]
*  And now she's saying, I live on a dirt road. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=108.02s)]
*  I can't have an EV. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=110.14s)]
*  So I'll let you get whatever car you want. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=111.92s)]
*  But she voted for those EV mandates. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=113.9s)]
*  You know, Tudor, we were discussing even off camera and on the couch about this endorsement [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=116.64s)]
*  by this mayor, this Arab American mayor in Michigan. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=121.6s)]
*  Tell us what that means. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=125.12s)]
*  Is that an isolated case? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=126.12s)]
*  Are you seeing what are you seeing in the Arab American community? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=127.12s)]
*  Is that important? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=130.06s)]
*  And could it could it swing things for Donald Trump? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=131.34s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=134.4s)]
*  Because what we're seeing right now is that there's kind of two factions in the Arab American [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=135.4s)]
*  community, one of which is saying they want to stay home. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=140.2s)]
*  They don't want to vote for either. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=143.64s)]
*  And the other is this group from Yemen who is saying we want to support Donald Trump. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=145.12s)]
*  If we have the Arab American community come out and support Donald Trump in that way, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=150.12s)]
*  that is a huge change for the state of Michigan. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=155.4s)]
*  And it's definitely a huge change for Democrats in the state of Michigan. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=157.84s)]
*  Also, you have to remember, these folks are listening when they they mock religion as [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  well. This is all about religious freedom. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  And when we talk about the Catholics, the Catholics have not only this week been offended [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  by Kamala Harris, but also by Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  And so these folks of other religions are watching this and saying, if you feel this [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=176.28s)]
*  way about faith, you're going to feel this way about all faiths. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  And we do not want to take the chance of you ratcheting back our religious liberties. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=183.56s)]
*  So has there been a kind of a blowback for Gretchen Whitmer over that really bizarre [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=188.28s)]
*  thing she did on the social media with the giving the communion with the Dorito? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=193.04s)]
*  Did people notice that at home? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=199.92s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. There were protests outside of her home the next day. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=201.92s)]
*  Catholic bishops went to her house with a bunch of parishioners. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=205.56s)]
*  They went outside of her home and protested her. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=209.48s)]
*  So you add that. Think about that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=213.4s)]
*  You add that to then a few days later, Harris not going to the dinner in D.C. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=214.96s)]
*  and then mocking Catholicism with the Molly Shannon skit. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=220.72s)]
*  The whole when you put that all together and then and then, as you noted, Rachel, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  she went to Wisconsin and was talking about pro lifers not being a part of their party [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=229.68s)]
*  anymore. Where do pro life or religious, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=234.44s)]
*  faithful people fit in the Democrat Party? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=239.16s)]
*  And I think that's a question certainly in Michigan today, which is coming from both [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  Harris and Whitmer. And when you have that happen in Michigan, if you lose the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=246.28s)]
*  Catholics, if you lose half of the Arab American community, there's no path for [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=250.32s)]
*  Harris. That's fascinating. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=254.88s)]
*  It really is fascinating. OK, Tudor, thank you so much for being with us this morning. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0G_CbeHIB8&t=257.08s)]
