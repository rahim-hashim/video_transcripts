# DeSantis warns Kamala Harris not doing well 'at all' with key group
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU)
*  President Trump promising Latino voters in Florida a secure border and an end to migrant crime. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=0.0s)]
*  While Kamala Harris uses a Telemundo interview to make her pitch to Hispanic voters. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=5.44s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis joins us now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=10.56s)]
*  Governor DeSantis, great to have you this morning. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=13.64s)]
*  I want to start with this poll of USA Today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=16.4s)]
*  And what you see here is Trump with an 11-point lead among Latino voters. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=19.64s)]
*  You did extraordinarily well with Latino voters in your race for governor. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=24.32s)]
*  Are you seeing a trend of Latinos going toward the Republican Party? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=28.48s)]
*  Well, certainly in Florida. I think Donald Trump will do very well. He'll win Hispanics. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=34.32s)]
*  I think we won 62 or 63 percent two years ago in 2022. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=39.28s)]
*  And I don't think Kamala Harris is going to play well at all. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=44.0s)]
*  I think one of the things in Florida that's been exciting is, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=46.8s)]
*  you go back when I got elected governor, there were 300,000 more registered Democrats. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=50.0s)]
*  Now we're into this election. We have a million more registered Republicans now in Florida. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=54.64s)]
*  And I think you're seeing Hispanic voters play a big part of that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=60.4s)]
*  So this is the first presidential election, certainly in modern history, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=64.0s)]
*  where Florida is not a swing state. Florida is going to go clear red across the board. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=68.88s)]
*  Governor, I want to talk to you about some of these amendments because they're very [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=74.4s)]
*  important in the state of Florida. I want to start with amendment four. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=77.12s)]
*  This is the abortion initiative in Florida. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=79.92s)]
*  And we've seen the Republican Party lose every single abortion ballot initiative across the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=82.8s)]
*  country. And what people don't realize is the language is vague in these. It often leads to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=87.92s)]
*  taxpayer funded abortion, no parental consent, abortion until birth being legalized. It's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=92.16s)]
*  rather radical. But in Florida, there's going to be language on the ballot explaining much of that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=98.48s)]
*  There's also a 60 percent threshold. Do you think you can win on amendment four? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=103.44s)]
*  No, absolutely. I think once people figure out the things you just said, and this was written very [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=107.44s)]
*  vaguely and deceptively, it should not even be on the ballot because they're trying to fool people. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=114.08s)]
*  Their ad campaign talks nothing about their ads. They're just lying about Florida law. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  One of the things in amendment four, you're exactly right. Abortion until birth will likely [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=124.8s)]
*  lead to taxpayer funding. It eliminates parental consent for minors, which is absolutely extreme [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=129.84s)]
*  and radical. But it does something that I don't even think California or Colorado, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=135.44s)]
*  some of these states did. It allows non-physicians to green light abortions up until the moment of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=139.68s)]
*  birth. And they had always talked about the importance of the physician. So we've got a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=145.44s)]
*  lot of physicians in Florida who are speaking out against it. So if you're pro-life, obviously, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=148.96s)]
*  this is an easy no. But even if you're not, I don't know very many people who want to see abortion [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=153.92s)]
*  until birth or think that physicians should be displaced in favor of healthcare provider, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=159.36s)]
*  which you and I know can be a whole host of different things short of a licensed physician. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=165.36s)]
*  Sure. Another amendment that's very important is amendment three. And we're going to put up what [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=170.24s)]
*  amendment three would mean. And this is about legal weed. And Governor DeSantis, one thing, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=173.68s)]
*  a case that your team is making is that this would not limit it in public places. So is Florida going [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=178.4s)]
*  to start smelling like New York, God forbid, if this passes? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=184.0s)]
*  That will happen. Yes. And here's the thing, this amendment, how did this get here? That's one big [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=189.44s)]
*  weed company has spent $100 million. And they wrote the amendment to benefit them, not to benefit the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=194.4s)]
*  people of Florida. So this is not about freedom because they don't let you grow your own weed. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=202.4s)]
*  If you want to do that in your backyard, you got to buy it from them. They create a big weed cartel. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=207.84s)]
*  But on the other hand, they don't limit use in public. So you will see rampant use. So to me, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=212.88s)]
*  this is anti-freedom. They don't let you grow your own. But on the other hand, people that don't want [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=217.84s)]
*  to be involved in marijuana will have their freedoms infringed upon when this is in our parks, on our [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=222.88s)]
*  beaches, just like it is in Colorado, in California, and places like that. And I would say this is a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=227.92s)]
*  horribly written amendment. If you don't like weed, obviously you vote no. But even if you do, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=233.68s)]
*  you have to read the actual text. This amendment actually gives the big weed companies [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=238.48s)]
*  total immunity from any civil liability. So if they sell you bad weed, you can't sue them. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  This is not something that should be in a constitution in the state of Florida. We have [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  medical marijuana that's legal in Florida. People can get cards and do it. But we have not let it [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=255.11999999999998s)]
*  run rampant around our state and infringe on people's quality of life. If this amendment passes, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  it will reduce the quality of life in the state of Florida. There's no question. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=266.4s)]
*  Well, the text does matter. And I actually saw on that amendment four about abortion, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=270.08s)]
*  a pro-choice voter saying in an ad why she was voting against it. So very interesting, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=273.44s)]
*  very important. Governor DeSantis, thank you as always. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU&t=278.0s)]
