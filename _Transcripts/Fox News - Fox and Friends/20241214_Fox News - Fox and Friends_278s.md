# 'Profits over patriotism,’ says lawmaker on NCAA’s decision to put other games on Army-Navy game day
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck)
*  All right, welcome back to Fox and Friends, the Syrian rebel group that overthrew the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=0.0s)]
*  Assad regime, setting up an interim government and putting an acting leader in place. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=9.1s)]
*  Trump warning on True Social that the U.S. should not get involved in Syria. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=14.32s)]
*  But with that group currently designated as a terrorist organization in the U.S., could [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=19.48s)]
*  Trump's pledge against forever wars be tested? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=23.52s)]
*  Joey Jones is with Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan, head of the Army-Navy game. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=26.76s)]
*  With more on that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  Hey guys. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=32.88s)]
*  Morning, Joey. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=33.88s)]
*  Hey guys, thanks. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=34.88s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=36.44s)]
*  Listen, you know, not just a senator from Alaska, but also a Marine Colonel, recently [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=37.44s)]
*  retired Marine Colonel, and probably important for this topic, you serve on the Senate Armed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Services Committee. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  And so when we look at what's developed in Syria this week and really the entire landscape [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  with Israel, President Trump-elect is going to office on a promise to keep us out of forever [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=52.96s)]
*  wars, out of wars that we don't see a strategic advantage or that will last longer than we [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  can afford. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  Do you think we're going to have the opportunity to do that, to stay out of these wars? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, well, Joey, first, good morning and thanks for your great service, Staff Sergeant, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=67.68s)]
*  right? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=73.4s)]
*  You know, there's a lot going on in the Middle East. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=74.4s)]
*  A lot of it's actually positive in terms of the developments, like in Syria. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=76.76s)]
*  A lot of it, in my view, is because of Israel's strong military response. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=82.12s)]
*  And Presidents Trump and Republicans, we're going to be focused on peace through strength [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=86.84s)]
*  and returning our military to lethality. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  Biden has not done that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=94.0s)]
*  And I think that's going to be important and good for operations if we have them in the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  Middle East or anywhere around the world. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think the element of being able to back up your promise goes a long way. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  We saw that with President Trump the first time and I hope it does keep us out of war [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=106.28s)]
*  because behind us, we've got some warriors that are going to take the football field. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=109.16s)]
*  We've got the Army, Navy game and we want those young men to have the opportunity to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=112.8s)]
*  serve in peace. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=117.08s)]
*  I mean, that's what we want. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=118.08s)]
*  So we've got this game today. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=119.32s)]
*  It's just such an amazing experience to be here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=121.0s)]
*  But normally this game is the only game played today. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=123.86s)]
*  It's very special. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=127.8s)]
*  All of college football respects that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  Today is not the case. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=131.0s)]
*  There are two other bowl games. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=132.0s)]
*  So what are you doing to bring that back? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=133.0s)]
*  Well, first, I totally agree with you. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=135.12s)]
*  This is a time honored tradition and it's more than just a game. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=136.92s)]
*  This game unites Americans through patriotism. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  It honors service and sacrifice. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  And it very importantly inspires the next generation of Americans to serve their country. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=148.28s)]
*  So I led a letter with almost 60 members of Congress, one third are U.S. senators. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  And we wrote the top executives in the NCAA and the College Bowl program. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=159.84s)]
*  And we said, hey, keep that tradition of making this the only game today. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=164.6s)]
*  Do not put profits over patriotism. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=171.96s)]
*  You need to make sure that for one day you honor American service members and you honor [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=176.0s)]
*  our country. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=182.12s)]
*  Just one day. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=183.12s)]
*  That's all we need. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=184.12s)]
*  So we wrote them and hopefully they'll listen to us. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=185.12s)]
*  I hope they do listen to you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=187.56s)]
*  Like you were telling me, I didn't understand this when it comes to just the revenue that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  these schools can bring in from their football program. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=192.6s)]
*  The recruiting because it's hard to recruit to a service academy, especially in this landscape [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=194.96s)]
*  where players can jump around teams. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=199.2s)]
*  And not only is it hard to recruit and it's hard to get in. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=201.32s)]
*  And today's a special day. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=204.6s)]
*  Both of these teams are very good this year. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=206.26s)]
*  Very good this year. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=208.48s)]
*  And you're exactly right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=209.48s)]
*  Almost one third of the revenues for West Point and the Naval Academy for their athletic [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=210.48s)]
*  departments come from this game this day. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=215.88s)]
*  This is a huge recruiting tool to get young Americans to watch this game, to listen and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  learn about the patriotism. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=225.17999999999998s)]
*  Guys like Roger Staubach who won the Heisman and served in Vietnam. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=227.28s)]
*  This is such a storied tradition here and it really inspires young Americans to serve. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=231.72s)]
*  And that's why we're telling the NCAA senior executives, hey, let them have this day. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  And for the country, for our service members, one day a year you can afford it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  So hopefully they'll listen to us. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  I think they will. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=247.83999999999997s)]
*  I think we've made a strong case here today. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=249.0s)]
*  Listen, most people would say that Senator is your top title. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=250.96s)]
*  I personally think it's Marine Colonel. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=254.36s)]
*  Thank you for your service, sir. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDk5U1J-Uck&t=256.88s)]
