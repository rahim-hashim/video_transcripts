# NYC Democrat urges officials to end 'sanctuary' policies
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E)
*  So a New York City Democrat councilman is calling on city and state leaders to ditch sanctuary policy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=0.0s)]
*  Yep, a Democrat. He writes in a letter the policies quote, not only violate federal law, but also put New Yorkers in harm's way. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=6.0s)]
*  Democratic New York City Councilman, Councilmember Robert Holden joins us now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=14.0s)]
*  Robert, thanks on behalf of New Yorker for speaking up. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=18.0s)]
*  And you've said this before, do you feel as though people are going to listen after this election? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=22.0s)]
*  Well, they better because I love Tom Holman, the new border czar, who came last week on Fox and said, you know, we're going to hold these mayors and governors accountable. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=29.0s)]
*  Certainly, he said don't cross that line because they are violating with the sanctuary city laws by shielding. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=42.0s)]
*  They are violating. It's a felony to shield these criminals, these illegal immigrants. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=49.0s)]
*  So we need we need to start really doing that. We need to actually get rid of and deport these illegal aliens who are committing crime. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=56.0s)]
*  Can you imagine a scenario where there's a criminal being held in New York City? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=65.0s)]
*  It happens every day and he's an illegal alien, maybe what links to gangs. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=69.0s)]
*  I shows up and there's no cooperation from the NYPD under the laws from the city council. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=73.0s)]
*  It's just mind boggling. How is that in anyone's interest? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=80.0s)]
*  It's in nobody's interest. And we have to remember, especially in New York City, 9-11, what happened? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=84.0s)]
*  We didn't communicate. NYPD didn't communicate with obviously federal agents. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=90.0s)]
*  So that's how the terrorists got in. So we need some communications. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=97.0s)]
*  What we're doing here is we're like shielding them. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=102.0s)]
*  The governors, Democratic governors and the mayors of these sanctuary cities are shielding criminals and terrorists, Brian. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=105.0s)]
*  So this is why it's so very important to start cooperating. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=113.0s)]
*  And you say the problems to the city council, correct? These they are left wingers, ultra left wingers. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=116.0s)]
*  Yeah. And over the years, they're shielding these illegal aliens who have committing crimes, which is unbelievable. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=123.0s)]
*  Why would you want to keep them in our country to to really attack citizens? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=131.0s)]
*  But not only that, but conspire possibly. And we have terrorists that have gotten across the borders. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=136.0s)]
*  We know it and we don't know where they are. And of course, some of them are in New York City. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=142.0s)]
*  And that's very, very dangerous. So you have a mayor that could do something about it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=147.0s)]
*  The governor will ultimately make the decision. What could Mayor Adams do? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=153.0s)]
*  Because he has expressed frustration like you have expressed. Yeah, but he can also petition the governor. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=157.0s)]
*  He could possibly do, you know, some call on the city council. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=164.0s)]
*  So let's let's negotiate this. Let's try to amend some of the sanctuary city laws. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=169.0s)]
*  There's four of them over the years that the council has passed to have less cooperation with the feds. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=174.0s)]
*  We need to cooperate with ICE, especially on the illegal aliens that are committing crime. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=180.0s)]
*  And that's what I'm really focusing on. And also the possible terrorists that are are in New York City. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=185.0s)]
*  The mayor, Adams got a problem. If Governor Hall, if the governor wants him out with the indictments that are already been served him, he could be kicked out. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=193.0s)]
*  So if he takes on the governor, it's not going to work for him personally. Is that an issue? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=202.0s)]
*  Well, again, I'm looking to President Trump because I think President Trump could say, you know what, if you're not going to, if you're going to violate the laws, federal laws, the statutes that we have on the books, it's a felony to shield. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=208.0s)]
*  And harbor illegal aliens who have committed crimes. And you can't do that. You can't shield them from ICE. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=221.0s)]
*  So the president actually could say to the governor and to the mayor, cooperate with us or we're going to charge you with felonies. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=227.0s)]
*  How's that one, Brian? How's that? That's the reverse now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=234.0s)]
*  Now we can have the governor and the mayor charged with a felony for shielding and harboring illegal aliens, which Tom Holman said on Fox last week to Lawrence, by the way. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=237.0s)]
*  He said, you know, don't cross that line because it is a felony and we will hold you accountable. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=249.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Thanks for watching Fox. You're part of the Common Sense Caucus. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=255.0s)]
*  Three Democrats, six Republicans who care more about the country than the party. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=258.0s)]
*  And we appreciate it, Robert Holden. Thanks so much. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZDc9VnN9E&t=263.0s)]
