*  He's also expected to take part in campaign events in Texas and Michigan. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=12.8s)]
*  The Harris campaign is saying the Vice President will not be doing Rogan's podcast because [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=17.0s)]
*  of scheduling conflicts. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=21.12s)]
*  On Sunday, the former president is holding a massive rally in deep blue New York City [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=22.92s)]

*  right thing when it comes to the border. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=39.74s)]
*  She said, quote, I think we did the right thing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=40.74s)]
*  Wait a minute, that she's handling correctly? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=43.14s)]
*  Correct. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=45.74s)]
*  She said that? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=46.74s)]
*  She said that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=48.3s)]
*  She said, quote, I think we did the right thing. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=49.3s)]
*  We allowed 21 million people in. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=50.74s)]
*  We allowed 13,099 murderers. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=52.46s)]
*  We allowed mental institutions from all over the world. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=55.78s)]
*  If she said that, look, she's a grossly incompetent person. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=58.74s)]
*  And if she said that, they had the worst border in history. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=63.5s)]
*  I spoke exclusively with Trump campaign senior adviser Tim Murtaugh, who shared the Trump [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=67.3s)]
*  campaign's closing message to voters, saying, quote, Kamala Harris for the last four years [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  has wrecked the economy and the border. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump will fix both of them. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  Murtaugh telling me that the beauty of this election cycle is that everybody who is going [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  has lived through the Trump years and the Harris years. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=85.7s)]
*  Quote, they have experienced both administrations when Trump was president. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=88.5s)]
*  The economy was fantastic. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=92.26s)]
*  Inflation was nonexistent. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=94.18s)]
*  The border was secure and the world was at peace. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=95.46000000000001s)]

*  performed and also called out Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=108.62s)]
*  Donald Trump is running to be an American tyrant. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=112.02s)]
*  He does not understand this country, its history or what it means to be deeply American. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=118.1s)]
*  Harris was also joined by former president Barack Obama at the rally, slamming Trump [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  and doubling down on her economic policies. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=129.54s)]
*  Over the last years and in particular the last eight years, Donald Trump has become [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=133.06s)]

*  She's going to go after corporations that unfairly jack up prices. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=152.3s)]
*  She's going to make it easier to build and buy a home. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=156.3s)]
*  Harris will head back to Michigan on Saturday for a campaign event with Michelle Obama. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yja0MwhMCPg&t=160.57999999999998s)]
