# Campus protester had contact with Hamas: DOJ
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA)
*  So you look at the protests in college campuses and they say the same thing that these protesters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=0.0s)]
*  said that mutant that shot the two, the couple in D.C. that shed, you know, a free Palestine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=4.22s)]
*  Then you find out about the protesters and you say, were these all students at Columbia [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=13.1s)]
*  last year and a few months ago? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=16.98s)]
*  And the answer is no. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=19.14s)]
*  For example, the cover of the New York Post, you can see it now, if not I'll hold it up, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=20.52s)]
*  has a 20-year-old and this 20-year-old was on campus creating havoc, saying anti-Semitic [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=24.18s)]
*  phrases, punching Jewish kids in the face and he is directly contacted and supported [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=28.9s)]
*  by Hamas overseas. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=35.62s)]
*  He has the flag over him. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=37.94s)]
*  He's been arrested, I assume going to be deported if not jailed here, and he was part of the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  unrest, college age, but not a college kid up in Columbia. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=45.26s)]
*  Jew hater contemplating setting a student on fire, direct links to Hamas. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=50.7s)]
*  He was chatting with this Hamas group on social media, a weights trial indicted on three federal [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=54.78s)]
*  hate crimes against Jewish people and wore a green headband worn by Hamas. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  Send a mask. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=64.1s)]
*  So after October 7th, the show sent me to all these college campuses and I'm asking [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=65.1s)]
*  all these students who are protesters, they say they're protesters, you know, about October [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=70.26s)]
*  7th. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=75.14s)]
*  What about what they did to babies? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=76.14s)]
*  What about the hostages? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=77.14s)]
*  And they're all denying it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=78.14s)]
*  We're like, man, they sound like little Hamas, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=79.14s)]
*  Well come to find out they are. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=81.9s)]
*  A lot of the leaders are. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=83.06s)]
*  Now there are some naive kids, but I think we've got to be smarter than the country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=84.18s)]
*  Either we're going to be little Gaza or we're going to be America. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=87.54s)]
*  But we can't have people going down midtown Manhattan or going downtown where they attack [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=90.3s)]
*  the towers with kofi'as, with the flags of Hamas calling for a caliphate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=96.34s)]
*  It just doesn't make any sense. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=101.66s)]
*  And we keep saying, First Amendment, First Amendment, First Amendment, where do we draw [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=103.18s)]
*  the line? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=107.06s)]
*  If the people sound like terrorists are saying that they want to destroy the country, shouldn't [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=108.06s)]
*  we be able to arrest them? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=113.06s)]
*  I think yes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=114.62s)]
*  Former Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, who teaches at Stanford and is running the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=116.18s)]
*  Hoover Institute, said this about what she's seeing at elite institutions. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=121.02000000000001s)]
*  Let me say universities have made a lot of mistakes, including in the way that reacting [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=126.9s)]
*  to October 7th. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  You know, our kids chant from the river to the sea. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=132.14000000000001s)]
*  Some of them don't know from what river to what sea. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=136.45999999999998s)]
*  And so we have failed in terms of educating them about the Middle East, educating them [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=139.38s)]
*  about history, where we still talk about oppressors and oppressed colonizers and colonized. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=144.66s)]
*  The scientific research base of the United States of America is the research university. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  We made that decision 80 years ago. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=155.5s)]
*  We don't have a plan B. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=157.61999999999998s)]
*  And so I am a major believer in making sure that we are able to continue the kind of research [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=159.42s)]
*  that produced the stem cell revolution, that produced actually at Stanford, the double [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=168.06s)]
*  helix that produced the heart transplant. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=174.42s)]
*  We just have to make sure, especially at a time when we are being challenged by China [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=178.98s)]
*  along the technological front. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=183.42s)]
*  Dr. Rice is totally right, Brian, and she makes a strong case. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=185.42s)]
*  But universities have to decide. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=189.82s)]
*  Either they're going to commit themselves to the research and saving lives, or they're [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=192.06s)]
*  going to commit themselves to the anti-American Hamas rhetoric going after Jews on college [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=195.62s)]
*  campuses. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=200.7s)]
*  But either you want to be activists or you want to be scientists. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=201.7s)]
*  But you can't do both and get our money. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=203.7s)]
*  Yeah, they're all complaining. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=205.66s)]
*  You're taking away our research money, cancer research. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=206.66s)]
*  Then don't be silent about this. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=209.22s)]
*  Silence leads to violence. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=211.14s)]
*  If you want that money, you've got to follow the law. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=212.14s)]
*  You can't allow terrorism to happen on your campus. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=214.5s)]
*  And don't sue the president. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=216.74s)]
*  You sued the president, doubling, tripling down. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=218.14s)]
*  Now you're going through the courts. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=219.74s)]
*  Now it's a brawl. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=221.18s)]
*  So that's what the former Secretary of State said. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=222.46s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=225.62s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIVEk0kOKXA&t=226.62s)]
