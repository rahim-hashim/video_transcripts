# 'Fox & Friends': She had no good answer for this
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc)
*  All right, we've been waiting for it in her first official interview since becoming the Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=0.0s)]
*  Promising a new way forward despite her role as vice president for the last three and a half years. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=8.0s)]
*  And Harris is facing some criticism over having running mate Tim Walz by her side. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=14.0s)]
*  But her campaign insists she will do a solo interview. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=20.0s)]
*  So the vice president defending her policy flip flops on issues like the climate and the border while struggling to lay out her day one agenda. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=24.0s)]
*  First and foremost, one of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=34.0s)]
*  When I look at the aspirations, the goals, the ambitions of the American people, I think that people are ready for a new way forward. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=44.0s)]
*  Day one, it's going to be about one implementing my plan for what I call an opportunity economy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=56.0s)]
*  I've already laid out a number of proposals in that regard, which include what we're going to do to bring down the cost of everyday goods, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=61.0s)]
*  what we're going to do to invest in America's small businesses, what we're going to do to invest in families. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=68.0s)]
*  I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020 that I would not ban fracking as vice president. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=74.0s)]
*  I did not ban fracking as president. I will not ban fracking. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=80.0s)]
*  I believe it is very important that we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=84.0s)]
*  I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=94.0s)]
*  My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=103.0s)]
*  I spent two terms as the attorney general of California prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=108.0s)]
*  violations of American laws regarding the passage, illegal passage of guns, drugs, and human beings across our border. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=114.0s)]
*  My values have not changed. So that is the reality of it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=122.0s)]
*  I mean, this is the question every politician gets. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=126.0s)]
*  What are you going to do on day one? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=130.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm not just talking about the presidency. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=132.0s)]
*  They have Senate candidates, Congressional. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=134.0s)]
*  What do you do on day one? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=136.0s)]
*  What she gave us was a dream. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=138.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=141.0s)]
*  Like, as if she had control of Congress, they had a bill ready for her on day one, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=142.0s)]
*  not what she plans on doing from a ceremonial standpoint. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=146.0s)]
*  Those bills, they're going to sign once she's sworn in. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=150.0s)]
*  And it just shows you when it comes to preparation, she's not prepared for even what she's going to do on day one. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=153.0s)]
*  How can we trust a four-year administration? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=159.0s)]
*  Yeah, Donald Trump was asked that question and he had very clear answers of the executive orders that he would sign. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=162.0s)]
*  He did that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=168.0s)]
*  And she also did not do a good job when Dana Bash went back and asked her and said, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=169.0s)]
*  well, a lot of people will say, why haven't you done this already? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=173.0s)]
*  You are the vice president. She didn't have a lot to say there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=176.0s)]
*  She also flip-flopped, you guys, on a very important topic for a very important state called Pennsylvania. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=179.0s)]
*  So here she is talking about fracking. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=185.0s)]
*  What she said, these are some of the things that we would refer to as flip-flops. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=189.0s)]
*  But last night she referred to them as, you know what? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=194.0s)]
*  I still have the same values. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=198.0s)]
*  For instance, in 2019, and we played a moment ago, that soundbite when she was running in the primary, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=199.0s)]
*  she endorsed a nationwide ban on oil and gas fracking. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=206.0s)]
*  We know that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=209.0s)]
*  Now the campaign has come out and said she does not support a total ban on fracking. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=210.0s)]
*  And then when it comes to the border, in 2019, when asked which candidates believe crossing the border without documentation should be a civil offense, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=215.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris raised her hand. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=222.0s)]
*  However, today Kamala Harris's campaign, now that she's running for president, says quite simply, unauthorized border crossings are illegal. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=224.0s)]
*  Essentially, with those two topics right there, I think we saw a preview of the presidential debate when it comes to fracking and when it comes to the border. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=234.0s)]
*  Because she was unequivocal last night. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=244.0s)]
*  She said, as president, I will not ban fracking. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=246.0s)]
*  And she talked a little bit about the Inflation Reduction Act, which she broke the tie in the Senate, actually expanded fracking leases. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=249.0s)]
*  And then when it comes to the topic of the border, we've heard this a million times. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=258.0s)]
*  She talked about how she, as president, would sign the bipartisan border bill once it got through the House and Senate. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=263.0s)]
*  And she told the story about how the former president saw that it would probably help Joe Biden and said, hey, guys, on the Republican side, let's not pass that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=270.0s)]
*  If you dig into that bill, that bill is really about more money going to NGOs to make the processing of more illegals over the border quicker so the press isn't seeing everything that's happening. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=280.0s)]
*  And the cap with the crossings is a fake cap. It's still catching release as well. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=293.0s)]
*  But back to the fracking thing, she doesn't explain the change of position. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=297.0s)]
*  So, Madam Vice President, you cast that vote. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=302.0s)]
*  Why did you do that? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=305.0s)]
*  Is it just because you were vice president and you were carrying out what the Commander in Chief Joe Biden says? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=306.0s)]
*  But Madam President, Vice President, you're going to be in the chair, or at least you hope to be in the chair. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=311.0s)]
*  So do you go back to your original position in 2019? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=317.0s)]
*  That follow up is critical because it's a difference when you're the vice president and you have to work or a cabinet member and you work within the system. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=322.0s)]
*  Your job is to serve at the pleasure of the president. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=331.0s)]
*  And it looks like that her positions, her gut instinct is to be much more progressive. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=334.0s)]
*  Yeah, no question. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=341.0s)]
*  Well, you had Larry Trump on earlier in the show and you got her reaction. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=342.0s)]
*  So here that is. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=346.0s)]
*  It feels like Kamala Harris is running for junior class president versus president of the United States. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=351.0s)]
*  You got no specifics whatsoever. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=357.0s)]
*  And there was not a moment that I watched that interview and I, as an American citizen, felt confident that this is a person who understands the job of president of the United States, has a true plan of action to do anything for America, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=359.0s)]
*  could negotiate with the world leaders on behalf of me as a citizen in this country. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=371.0s)]
*  And I think it's kind of what we've come to expect from Kamala Harris. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=377.0s)]
*  Junior class president. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=381.0s)]
*  Maybe that's why she was talking to the band class the other day at the high school. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=382.0s)]
*  Talking down to them, you mean? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=387.0s)]
*  Yeah, like they were kindergartners. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=388.0s)]
*  You got to figure they went to a school because he was a teacher and he was a coach and all that stuff. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=390.0s)]
*  I will say this about Tim Waltz. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=394.0s)]
*  He's really good at smiling and nodding because we thought, you know, if she got into a word salad problem, he would jump in. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=396.0s)]
*  As it turns out, last night he was only at when Kamala Harris was asked that that and Lawrence, I think you referred to it as a layup question. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=404.0s)]
*  What do you get to do on day one? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=413.0s)]
*  Dana Bash asked that question. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=414.0s)]
*  We've asked that question. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=416.0s)]
*  She asked it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=417.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris did not answer it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=418.0s)]
*  And so, Dana asked her again. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=420.0s)]
*  You didn't answer my question. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=422.0s)]
*  What would you say? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=423.0s)]
*  Listen, you only got like 20 minutes. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=424.0s)]
*  You're not going to waste a lot of time. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=426.0s)]
*  So she turned to Tim Waltz and asked him what are you going to do on the first day? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=428.0s)]
*  She should have stayed. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=432.0s)]
*  He didn't really answer. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=433.0s)]
*  She should have stayed with Kamala. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=434.0s)]
*  And you know what you see here too, you guys have seen those hearings in Congress where the witness just needs to like. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=435.0s)]
*  Fill up the time for the five minutes. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=443.0s)]
*  It's just monologue. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=445.0s)]
*  That's what I felt like was happening. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=446.0s)]
*  She was talking slowly. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=448.0s)]
*  She was making, you know, using as many words as possible. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=449.0s)]
*  But it was intentional to fill up the time because she knew this was only going to be a 20-something minute interview. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=452.0s)]
*  And also to that point, Rachel, Waltz, the governor, he couldn't save himself. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=458.0s)]
*  I mean, there was a moment there where he had to explain while he went out publicly and talked about his military service and the IVF and all that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=462.0s)]
*  And to just say his grammatical errors. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=471.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=474.0s)]
*  Well, he was able to work in the fact that his wife's an English teacher. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=475.0s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=479.0s)]
*  I didn't find it cute. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=480.0s)]
*  I really did not. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=482.0s)]
*  It was the you had how many days to come up with an explanation to why you lied to the American people and you let down a lot of troops. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=483.0s)]
*  People will accept an apology, but he didn't provide that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=491.0s)]
*  No. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=495.0s)]
*  Well, the campaign is they were very risk averse. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=496.0s)]
*  And what Danabash asked the questions we wanted answers to. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=499.0s)]
*  But they just gave as innocuous an answer as they possibly could. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=503.0s)]
*  But as I said earlier, I think it is if I'm the Trump campaign, I just got a little view of how they're going to answer fracking and how they are going to answer the border. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=507.0s)]
*  And we're going to talk to Senator J.D. Vance, who's running for vice president. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=518.0s)]
*  Let's see about 49 minutes from right now, right here on the Fox News Channel. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJYNovEzYgc&t=522.0s)]
