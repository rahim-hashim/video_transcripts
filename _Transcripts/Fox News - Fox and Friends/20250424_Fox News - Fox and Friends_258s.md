# Democrats' poll numbers crater among key group
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA)
*  Democrats making due process their new rallying cry using social media to advocate for the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=0.0s)]
*  release of suspected MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia and accused terrorist sympathizer [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=12.64s)]
*  Also here to put Donald Trump and his administration on notice with their abuse of power that it [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=15.36s)]
*  is not going unchecked. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=21.72s)]
*  Khalil deserves due process from a system that respects his constitutional rights, not [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=23.76s)]
*  one that isolates him. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=28.84s)]
*  He must demand justice. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=30.24s)]
*  More importantly, we're here to raise awareness that Kilmar needs to come home. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=31.64s)]
*  We have to draw the line here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=36.16s)]
*  We have to make a big deal about this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=38.24s)]
*  Members of Congress have to come here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=40.56s)]
*  Host of the Brett Cooper show, we have Brett Cooper here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=43.24s)]
*  Hey, Brett, thanks for coming on. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=46.36s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=49.2s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=50.2s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=51.2s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=52.2s)]
*  I know you have a lot of young listeners and viewers. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=53.2s)]
*  We wanted to get you on to react to this. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=54.2s)]
*  They're focused on these illegals. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=55.88s)]
*  Many of them are in gangs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Many of them are criminals. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=60.580000000000005s)]
*  They're going to these to their facilities. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  And then they're focused on these individuals that are sympathizers with Hamas, which is [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  a terrorist organization. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=69.12s)]
*  Why are the Democrats so focused on this issue? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=71.04s)]
*  Well, I think they're focused on this issue because it is obviously an emotional issue. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=73.84s)]
*  And they know that in order to reach Gen Z, I mean, historically in the past, it has been [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=79.28s)]
*  emotion, which is why you're seeing these selfie videos, these rallying cries, which [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=84.64s)]
*  in my opinion is basically just like a glorified AOC at the border photo op. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=88.92s)]
*  That's really what they're trying to convey through these videos. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=93.44s)]
*  But they know that that has been the way to reach Gen Z and they're trying all they can [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=97.26s)]
*  to do that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=101.0s)]
*  And they're trying through social media. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=102.0s)]
*  Does it work? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  Do these messages work for that generation on social media? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  I think it depends on the person. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=108.76s)]
*  It has in the past. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=110.84s)]
*  But again, we have seen such a change in demographics when it comes to Gen Z, even just within Gen [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=111.84s)]
*  Z ourselves. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=116.84s)]
*  There is such a split between older Gen Z and younger Gen Z of being left and right [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=117.84s)]
*  leaning. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=122.12s)]
*  And so I think that the tactics that they have been able to use in the past to reach [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=123.12s)]
*  my generation, you know, through social media, using big, broad, emotionally charged language, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=126.36s)]
*  that might not work the same way that it has in years past. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=132.04s)]
*  I think they need to listen to their voters for once and actually see how they're responding. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=134.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=139.24s)]
*  We learned that Dick Durbin, he's announced that he's the number two Democrat in the Senate, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=140.24s)]
*  that he is not going to seek reelection. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=144.36s)]
*  And there's a new poll out of Harvard. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=146.24s)]
*  They do this this poll annually. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=148.08s)]
*  It's young Americans that are polled age 18 to 29. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=150.68s)]
*  And their approval rating for the Democrats in Congress is souring. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=154.56s)]
*  In 2017, it was 42 percent. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=158.0s)]
*  In 2020, 48 percent. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=160.68s)]
*  And now it's 23 percent. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=162.5s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  I think the biggest thing is that the Democrats are completely out of touch with their [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=166.8s)]
*  voter base. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=170.08s)]
*  And you see members of Congress like Dick, who are, you know, are so old. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  They are aging out. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  We do not want them in Congress anymore on the left and the right. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=178.52s)]
*  And I think that young people feel unrepresented and they are fed up. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  And if they don't like Donald Trump, then they're angry that their representatives are [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=185.94000000000003s)]
*  not pushing back enough. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=189.24s)]
*  If they are more common sense in the center, they're angry with how radical they've gotten. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  They just feel completely left alone. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=194.4s)]
*  What is the Democrat Party? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=197.28s)]
*  Where do they go from here? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=198.4s)]
*  Because you have the progressives and then you have the old establishment that is more [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=199.64s)]
*  moderate. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=203.28s)]
*  I think that truly they are honing in on AOC and we're seeing AOC and Bernie Sanders do [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=204.28s)]
*  this whole, you know, fight the oligarchy tour that they're doing around the United [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=211.04s)]
*  States. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=214.24s)]
*  They're flying on their private jets, saying that they're going to fight the elites, which [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=215.24s)]
*  is so ironic. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=217.28s)]
*  But obviously they're garnering a huge audience. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=218.72s)]
*  And I think the Democrats are finally waking up to the fact that the establishment elites [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=220.64s)]
*  that they've been pushing for the last however many years, that that really isn't speaking [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  to modern Democrats. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=228.64s)]
*  That isn't speaking to young Gen Zers on the left, the remaining people that they have. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=229.64s)]
*  And so I think that they are going to have to change course. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  We will see if that works. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=236.6s)]
*  We'll see if AOC resonates with as many people as they're hoping. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=237.6s)]
*  But I mean, that is up for the voters to decide. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=241.04s)]
*  Okay, Brett, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=243.44s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKAPi-UJmTA&t=246.48s)]
