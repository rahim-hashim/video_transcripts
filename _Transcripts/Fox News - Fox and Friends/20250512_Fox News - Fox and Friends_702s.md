# Inside ICE facility where Dems clashed with agents, demanded entry
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI)
*  All right, so New Jersey Democrats are defending their actions of storm and Newark ice facility [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=0.0s)]
*  on Friday that ultimately resulted in the arrest of the city's mayor. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=8.6s)]
*  Madeleine Rivera joins us with more from Washington. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=14.56s)]
*  Hey, Maddie. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=17.04s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=18.04s)]
*  DHS says more arrests could be coming as they accuse three Democratic members of Congress [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=19.28s)]
*  of assaulting federal agents at an ice facility in Newark. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=24.02s)]
*  The lawmakers say it's the agents that escalated the situation. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=27.64s)]
*  People just are afraid of this un-American hyperactivity, this weaponization of law enforcement [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=32.2s)]
*  and the consistent lying. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  They made this a violent scene that we were unfortunately all a part of, and it's something [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=42.92s)]
*  that should really shock all Americans. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=47.68s)]
*  The lawmakers say they wanted to conduct an oversight visit at the ice facility when a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=50.56s)]
*  scuffle broke out with federal agents. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=54.84s)]
*  DHS is pointing to this video that they say shows at least one representative, LaMonica [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=57.48s)]
*  McIver, in the reg shoving her way past a DHS agent. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  They say she body slammed the officer, an accusation McIver rejects. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=66.24s)]
*  There's no video that supports me body slamming anyone. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=71.44s)]
*  We were simply there to do our job, therefore oversight visit. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=74.8s)]
*  DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin responded this morning. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=80.28s)]
*  A slaming body, ramming, striking an officer, pushing, shoving, whatever you want to call [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=85.6s)]
*  it, it sure looks like assault. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=91.16s)]
*  People should watch that and decide for themselves. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=93.55999999999999s)]
*  There's no place for that, especially members of Congress. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=95.56s)]
*  It is so beneath them to be treating law enforcement like this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=98.96s)]
*  Meantime, Newark's Mayor, Roz Baraka, who's running for New Jersey governor, is facing [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=103.96s)]
*  trespassing charges for allegedly ignoring warnings to leave the property. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=107.63999999999999s)]
*  Baraka argues he was on public property when he was detained. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=112.32s)]
*  The lawmakers were eventually able to tour the ICE facility after the confrontation. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=115.88s)]
*  McLaughlin says the situation could have been avoided had the members of Congress followed [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  protocol and given 24 hours notice ahead of their visit. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=124.36s)]
*  Lawrence Ainsley and Brian. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=128.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=129.12s)]
*  Thanks, Marilyn. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=130.12s)]
*  Thank you so much, Marilyn. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=131.12s)]
*  Rachel Compostuffi just got a tour of that ICE facility. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=132.12s)]
*  She was there. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=135.2s)]
*  She called over there. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=136.2s)]
*  They said, come on over and we'll take you through it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=137.2s)]
*  She's live there this morning. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=139.4s)]
*  Rachel. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=140.92s)]
*  Good morning, Ainsley, Lawrence and Brian. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=141.92s)]
*  Yes, I'm right here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=144.76s)]
*  I got dressed, Brian. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=145.83999999999997s)]
*  And I came over to the ICE detention facility. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=146.83999999999997s)]
*  And listen, I received the tour that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a representative out of New [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  York, is going to receive in just a few hours from now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=155.6s)]
*  And this is what I saw. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=159.2s)]
*  ICE has nothing to hide. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=161.48s)]
*  They have nothing to be ashamed of. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  This facility is so clean. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=165.32s)]
*  It has all kinds of recreation facilities, outdoor soccer fields, weight equipment, domino [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=168.84s)]
*  tables. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=177.56s)]
*  It also has telephones everywhere with signs next to them of how they can, who the phone [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=178.96s)]
*  numbers to reach their consulates. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=184.36s)]
*  It also has legal facilities, computer webcams. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  Their doors on the bedrooms, on the places where they sleep aren't even locked. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=190.44s)]
*  This facility is actually looks like a high school, actually looks better than a lot of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=196.24s)]
*  high schools. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  And a lot of our own prisons for American citizens could take a lesson from this facility. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=201.32000000000002s)]
*  In fact, the director of ICE, who took me around, he told me, Todd Lyons told me, that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  they can't even contract with state and local prisons and facilities. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  They have to use private facilities because their standards are so high and it's just [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  too expensive for them to retrofit their facilities to put the ICE detainees in. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=223.12s)]
*  So that's the lowdown on that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=227.56s)]
*  Here's a clip of him telling me the kind of person that comes into this facility. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=230.8s)]
*  You can't come here, you guys, just because you crossed the border illegally. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=235.76s)]
*  You have to have committed another crime. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=239.76s)]
*  Listen. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=241.8s)]
*  The person who ends up in this facility is not just that they crossed the border illegally. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=242.8s)]
*  You had to have done more than that, correct? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=249.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=252.28s)]
*  So currently today, as we're walking through here today, there's 152 detainees. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=253.28s)]
*  75% of those have committed crimes, convicted a crime, or had pending criminal charges. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  So what kind of crimes are we talking about? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=263.84s)]
*  We unfortunately, it runs the whole gamut. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  More than 75% of the people that are here are felons. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=268.5s)]
*  Bad people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=272.64s)]
*  You don't want any neighborhood. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=273.64s)]
*  Yeah, guys, more proof that, you know, Democrats just love to defend the worst kind of illegal [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=274.64s)]
*  immigrants. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=285.36s)]
*  So these are rapists, murderers, people accused of burglary and other felonies. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=286.36s)]
*  Here's another thing that I found really interesting. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  Everywhere you go, in Spanish and English, there are signs up that say, do you want to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  go home? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=296.88s)]
*  Quieres ir a tu casa? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=297.88s)]
*  And it gives you a phone number that you can call to self-deport. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=299.92s)]
*  Or you can also just tell somebody in the facility, hey, I'm ready to be done with this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=304.24s)]
*  I just want to go home to my country. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=308.76s)]
*  If you do that, the American government, through ICE, will arrange within 48 hours a free flight [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  and $1,000 so you can get out. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=316.36s)]
*  So the idea that they are here with no agency, that they are being, you know, detained with [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=318.8s)]
*  no choices, that's not true. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=323.8s)]
*  They have a choice to self-deport, and they make it really easy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=326.02000000000004s)]
*  Rachel, I'm just curious, and this is the rector for all of ICE in the country, and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=330.04s)]
*  I know you were there too in this facility. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  But how does the director feel about the Democrats defending the criminals that are in that facility [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  that you were in and not defending the people that they're victimizing on a day-to-day basis? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=344.92s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=351.48s)]
*  We had that conversation. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  We also talked about why they're not out defending or standing up for and looking into [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=355.96s)]
*  oversight at our own prisons for our own American citizens. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=361.96s)]
*  I know I talked to Representative Claudia Tenney on Fox and Friends Weekend, and she told me [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  the conditions are deplorable in her state of New York for prisoners. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  So I'm not sure about that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=372.84s)]
*  I'll tell you what I thought, and this will ring true with you as well, Lawrence, because [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=374.28s)]
*  you were there in Uvalde. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  Uvalde, Texas, was home to a detention center for unaccompanied minors, and I could not [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=380.56s)]
*  get in there. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=387.32s)]
*  The mayor couldn't get in there. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=388.4s)]
*  Members of Congress had difficulty getting in there. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=390.64s)]
*  They didn't care about the most vulnerable people who come over the border, and they [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=393.04s)]
*  didn't ask for DNA tests, by the way Democrats didn't for those vulnerable children who [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=397.08s)]
*  came across the border. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=401.6s)]
*  But they're outside of this facility making a ruckus, causing trouble, assaulting police [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=402.92s)]
*  officers for what? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=408.03999999999996s)]
*  For rapists, murders, and other criminals. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=409.64s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=412.23999999999995s)]
*  Great job, Rachel. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=413.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for getting up early and going out there. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=414.23999999999995s)]
*  You got it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=418.28s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=419.28s)]
*  It's interesting that they have the consulate's numbers right on the phones. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=420.28s)]
*  They don't lock the doors so that they can move around. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=422.96s)]
*  So body camera footage showing things getting physical when Democrats stormed a New Jersey [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=426.12s)]
*  ICE facility. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=430.32s)]
*  Those lawmakers continue to defend their actions and even blaming the agents there. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=431.38s)]
*  People just are afraid of this un-American hyperactivity, this weaponization of law enforcement. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=437.8s)]
*  We were getting reports prior to our tour that children were there. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=446.16s)]
*  We did not know the status of the facility or the status of the detainees. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=449.56s)]
*  And so that is why we showed up there to do our job. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=454.16s)]
*  They made this a violent scene that we were unfortunately all a part of. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  And it's something that should really shock all Americans. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=461.2s)]
*  DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin joins us now. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=464.24s)]
*  So Tricia, I guess the big question is what happened that day? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=467.64000000000004s)]
*  It looks like law enforcement were trying to do what they do every single day is transport [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=470.72s)]
*  people that are illegal, that have been put into custody. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  They normally secure that area. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=479.72s)]
*  It looks like that the mayor tried to block that as well as members of Congress. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=481.12s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=485.6s)]
*  Yeah, Lawrence, these members of Congress and protesters, a mob of protesters, stormed [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=487.12s)]
*  this gate to try and enter the detention facility. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=492.64s)]
*  The detention facility holds members of MS-13, child rapists, murders, arsonists, drug traffickers, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=495.44s)]
*  American killers. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=503.44s)]
*  And for them to try and get these individuals out is just beyond the pale. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=504.8s)]
*  We know that the mayor, we know these members of Congress want their 15 minutes of fame [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=509.36s)]
*  so desperately, but they're willing to do it at the peril of the safety of our brave [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=513.2s)]
*  law enforcement and even the detainees as well, Lawrence. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=518.72s)]
*  Tricia, why didn't y'all charge them? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=521.68s)]
*  Because it's simple. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=524.16s)]
*  We did charge the mayor. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=524.8s)]
*  Well, not just the mayor, but the members of Congress. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=526.2399999999999s)]
*  I'm looking at them pushing on law enforcement, trying to get into the facility. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  If it was any other average American citizen, they would have been charged with assault [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=532.4s)]
*  on cop and obstruction of justice. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=536.4799999999999s)]
*  They should be charged. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=538.88s)]
*  Why not? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=540.0s)]
*  This is an ongoing investigation, Lawrence, but you're absolutely right. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=540.8s)]
*  These members of Congress, this mayor, and these protesters are not above the law. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=544.56s)]
*  If they had wanted a tour, we will easily facilitate that for them. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=549.0400000000001s)]
*  We actually laid out the guidelines on our DHS Twitter that show you need at least 24 [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=553.36s)]
*  hours of notice to these ICE detention facilities to make sure that staff, that detainees, and [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=558.72s)]
*  that our law enforcement are safe and there's proper protocols and proper channels followed. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=564.0s)]
*  Here's one of the representatives responding to body slamming agents. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=568.1600000000001s)]
*  Let's watch it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=571.76s)]
*  And we hope that all of the body cam is released. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  It was a very tense situation. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=582.72s)]
*  Unfortunately, it did not have to be like that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=585.6s)]
*  They created that confrontation. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=587.52s)]
*  They created that chaos. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=589.76s)]
*  So did your agents create this confrontation? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=591.44s)]
*  Absolutely not, Lawrence. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=595.0400000000001s)]
*  They were just simply doing their job and trying to keep the facility safe. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=596.08s)]
*  Body slamming, body ramming, striking an officer, pushing, shoving, whatever you want to call it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=600.48s)]
*  It sure looks like assault. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=606.48s)]
*  People should watch that and decide for themselves. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=608.4s)]
*  There is no place for that, especially members of Congress. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=610.4s)]
*  It is so beneath them to be treating law enforcement like this, our brave law enforcement. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=613.92s)]
*  We thank them for keeping that facility safe and keeping Americans safe every single day. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=619.52s)]
*  So Tricia, they later got a tour of the facility. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=624.96s)]
*  What happened once they received a tour? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=627.92s)]
*  Did they see anything that was wrong? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=630.24s)]
*  Well, Lawrence, you'll probably remember that part of the reason that they were protesting [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=634.16s)]
*  apparently is because they were saying we didn't have the right permitting, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=638.16s)]
*  we didn't have the right inspection, which is absolutely false. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=641.04s)]
*  We had all the right permitting, all the right fire code inspection, electrical inspection, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=644.0s)]
*  safety inspection. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=648.64s)]
*  But in a press conference afterward, just showcasing that they want their 15 minutes of fame, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=649.84s)]
*  they actually said that the conditions in the facility were quite good and up to snuff. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=655.04s)]
*  So it's pathetic. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=660.24s)]
*  And we won't stand for this in this administration. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=662.0s)]
*  We're not playing games with the safety of our law enforcement. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=664.64s)]
*  What can we expect real quickly, because I got to run, when can we expect to hear from [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=667.76s)]
*  law enforcement on if charges are going to be pressed? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=672.4s)]
*  I just think it's a dangerous precedent to set. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=675.28s)]
*  When should we hear from law enforcement on that? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=678.96s)]
*  Real quick. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=681.2s)]
*  I'm going to leave that to the Department of Justice, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=682.72s)]
*  but this is an ongoing investigation and everything's on the table, Lawrence. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=684.16s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=687.12s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining the program. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=687.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvNyhvRERBI&t=690.56s)]
