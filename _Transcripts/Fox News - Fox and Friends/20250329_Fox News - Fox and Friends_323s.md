# This is a key part of the MAHA agenda: White House official
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU)
*  There is 60% of our country now that has only one dream, which is to get better. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=0.0s)]
*  And we need to give them a pathway to doing that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=8.84s)]
*  And the pathway is through food. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=11.84s)]
*  Food is medicine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=14.6s)]
*  It treats us in different ways, and it treats our health. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=16.6s)]
*  Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. joining West Virginia Governor [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=22.16s)]
*  Patrick Morrissey yesterday to further the Make America Healthy Again movement, touting [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=26.56s)]
*  the idea that food is medicine. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=32.28s)]
*  Will other states follow suit? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Here to react, White House Senior Advisor Callie Means. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=37.72s)]
*  Callie, it's always great to have you back on Fox and Friends Weekend. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=40.48s)]
*  So tell us about what he was doing in West Virginia and why this is so groundbreaking. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  What Secretary Kennedy is showing is that making America healthy isn't complicated. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=49.12s)]
*  It just takes political courage that no administration previously has had. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=54.36s)]
*  Now Food Stamp SNAP is the fourth largest entitlement program in the country. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=58.96s)]
*  It's $120 billion. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=62.56s)]
*  And it's run by the states. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=64.52s)]
*  And governors can ask the federal government what ingredients should be on it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=66.32s)]
*  And right now, Rachel, the top item on Food Stamps is soda. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=71.2s)]
*  We are sending $10 billion a year from the federal treasury to soda companies to subsidize [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=75.16s)]
*  that drink for lower income kids. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=80.7s)]
*  So what Bobby Kennedy, President Trump and Secretary Rollins have done in partnership [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=82.96s)]
*  is ask governors to request a federal waiver. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=86.52s)]
*  The most obese state in the country, West Virginia, the governor bravely submitted this [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  waiver. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=94.63999999999999s)]
*  Many governors from Utah to Arkansas to Louisiana are following. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=95.63999999999999s)]
*  And this is clear leadership against the soda lobbyists for American children and just the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=100.38s)]
*  start of the administration's efforts to make America healthy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=106.11999999999999s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  It's truly extraordinary to think of the idea that good government, even liberals who think [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  the government is the answer to everything, but yet the government is actually subsidizing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  obesity in many places by allowing Food Stamps to be used for these things. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=121.48s)]
*  I think this is a key part of the Make America Healthy Again agenda. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=127.72s)]
*  People ask, you had Mike Bloomberg and Michelle Obama, and is this the same as that? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=137.12s)]
*  They were talking about soda taxes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=138.12s)]
*  They were talking about top-down mandates. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=139.56s)]
*  What the Trump administration, Secretary Kennedy, Secretary Rollins are saying is let's cut [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  the subsidies. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=146.0s)]
*  It's not conservative. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=147.12s)]
*  It's not liberal. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=148.12s)]
*  It just makes no sense to have a $10 billion subsidy for soda. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=149.12s)]
*  And then when you back up to the incentives for a food system, of our health care system, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=153.06s)]
*  we are truly incentivizing poison for kids. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=157.56s)]
*  And then the health care industry profits when they're sick. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=160.8s)]
*  So they're going to go after that, and they're going to go after transparency. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  If Americans have the right information and they don't have subsidies to do the wrong [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=166.6s)]
*  thing, I think we'll be in a much better place. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=171.48s)]
*  Such a great point. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  And the other initiative that RFK Junior is working on right now is called Operation Stork [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  Speed, which is an initiative that will look into making sure that baby formula is as safe [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=179.04s)]
*  and healthy as possible. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=184.92s)]
*  I know that a lot of young parents right now really feel like European formulas are safer [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=185.92s)]
*  than American. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=191.1s)]
*  So first of all, is that true? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=192.1s)]
*  And also, what can you tell us about the safety and health of formulas out there right now [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=193.46s)]
*  that are sold in the United States? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=197.1s)]
*  This is so important. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=199.3s)]
*  One of the top donors to the American Academy of Pediatrics is formula companies that are [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=200.86s)]
*  saying sometimes formula is more safe than breast milk. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=204.46s)]
*  This is a scandal. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=208.58s)]
*  Moms are super frustrated. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=209.58s)]
*  But the votes of Maha moms have led the Trump administration to really take these issues [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=210.58s)]
*  on. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=215.06s)]
*  Right now, soybean farmers lobby to require seed oils in our baby formula. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=216.06s)]
*  In the most popular baby formula in America, corn syrup is the number one ingredient. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=219.36s)]
*  This is a total scandal. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  So big news this week. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=225.0s)]
*  Marty McCary was voted in as the FDA commissioner, and he's going to go hard at this and demanding [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=226.72000000000003s)]
*  that U.S. formula is the safest and best in the world for American children. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=232.08s)]
*  You know, Callie, I can't think of a more important topic. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  You and I have talked about the importance of breastfeeding. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=240.38000000000002s)]
*  This week at the White House, Donald Trump said he wants to be the fertilization president. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  I hope you guys push breastfeeding, which is always best for both spiritual, physical [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=247.36s)]
*  and nutritional reasons. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=253.96s)]
*  And maybe he'll become the breastfeeding president. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=255.8s)]
*  That would be amazing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=258.44s)]
*  Rachel, there are so many great things happening, and I think you're going to have an unrelenting [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=259.44s)]
*  flurry of good news. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=265.48s)]
*  But I know the administration is thinking very carefully about the holistic cause of our [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=267.1s)]
*  fertility crisis. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=271.8s)]
*  Why are people becoming infertile in the first place? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  What are the links between food and our environmental toxins? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=277.28s)]
*  How can we help mothers have more babies? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=279.88s)]
*  There's been an attack on motherhood from the Biden administration, and this is going [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=283.67999999999995s)]
*  to be the most pro-mother, pro-baby administration in history. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=288.11999999999995s)]
*  And no, men are not capable of breastfeeding, just to be clear. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  It's not chestfeeding, it's breastfeeding for a reason. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=296.67999999999995s)]
*  And what you said is something that all parents, no matter your political affiliation, can [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=298.91999999999996s)]
*  get behind. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=302.23999999999995s)]
*  Callie, thank you so much for joining us this morning and all that for us. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=303.23999999999995s)]
*  Every day, Maha gets better. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=306.44s)]
*  Thank you, Callie. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=307.84s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTKxKPLGUjU&t=308.84s)]
