# RFK Jr. on Trump’s new surgeon general pick
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg)
*  Joining us now is HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for joining us this morning. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=3.2s)]
*  So it's really remarkable watching that interview last week [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=6.0s)]
*  with you and Brett Baer and the four of you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=10.28s)]
*  I cannot remember ever seeing a more radical diversion, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  departure from the previous administration [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=21.6s)]
*  to a current administration. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=25.16s)]
*  And with this announcement with the food dyes, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  how big a part of everything you wanna get done [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=30.88s)]
*  are these dyes? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=35.2s)]
*  Well, the dyes are important both from a reality point of view. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=38.68s)]
*  They're linked to cancers, they're linked to ADHD, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=45.2s)]
*  to all kinds of neurological impacts. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=50.32s)]
*  There are nine synthetic petroleum-based food dyes [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  that we're gonna get rid of. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=57.0s)]
*  The two worst ones, citrus red and orange number two, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=58.88s)]
*  we're gonna get, within the next two months, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=64.84s)]
*  we're gonna get them off the mark. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=67.64s)]
*  We're gonna revoke their authorizations. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=69.0s)]
*  We're gonna revoke the authorizations [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=71.64s)]
*  for red dye number three much quicker [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=74.0s)]
*  than the Biden administration during the last days [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=76.2s)]
*  had announced that they were gonna get rid [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=79.76s)]
*  of red dye number three by 2027. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=82.92s)]
*  We're gonna do it much, much faster. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=84.96s)]
*  And the food industry has really stepped up [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=87.32s)]
*  and I'm so, we're working together, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=91.52s)]
*  we're very well together within the agency, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  FDA, NIH, and CDC. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  But the industry's working with us. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=101.25999999999999s)]
*  And yesterday, Tyson Foods announced [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=103.16s)]
*  that it's gonna get rid of all of its synthetic dyes by May. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  So the industry is coming to the table, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  they're talking to us, they're taking this seriously [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=113.56s)]
*  and I'm very, very happy with John King at Tyson's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=117.4s)]
*  for really, he told me when we met with him two months ago, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=121.76s)]
*  we're gonna get this done. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=125.72s)]
*  And no matter what anybody tells you, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=128.08s)]
*  the industry can do this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=130.28s)]
*  And he's really stepped up in an amazing way. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  It's one of the biggest food companies [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=135.6s)]
*  and they're taking their dye out of all of their products. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=137.08s)]
*  So, you know, I'm very optimistic [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=140.08s)]
*  that we can get this done. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  Americans support it, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  they don't wanna be eating petroleum anymore. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  You know, I'm just, can I dig into that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=150.88000000000002s)]
*  just a little bit more? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=152.8s)]
*  I'm coming from the business side of things. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=153.62s)]
*  And I hear so many people say, you know, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=155.16000000000003s)]
*  big industry wants to keep people sick [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=157.84s)]
*  or keep people addicted or unhealthy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=160.56s)]
*  And I'm hearing a very different message from you today [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=162.68s)]
*  that you're actually finding a ton of buy-in from business. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=165.44s)]
*  Are you surprised by that? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=168.88s)]
*  And what does that mean in terms of the possibilities [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=170.6s)]
*  for what you wanna do? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=173.12s)]
*  I am, and it's, you know, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=176.16s)]
*  the pharmaceutical industry actually, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=178.72s)]
*  the food industry really is not profiting [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=181.68s)]
*  from keeping us all sick, but it is keeping us sick. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=183.96s)]
*  The pharmaceutical industry actually profits from it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=188.48s)]
*  But I have found, you know, I met with the leader, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=192.4s)]
*  the CEOs of the four of the biggest [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=196.2s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies this week, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=199.88s)]
*  and I've met with them repeatedly. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  I talk to them all the time, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  and they are committed to making this happen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=205.72s)]
*  So, you know, we'll see. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=210.11999999999998s)]
*  A lot of it is gonna go against [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=211.66s)]
*  their immediate financial interests, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=213.32s)]
*  the interests of their shareholders, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=215.6s)]
*  a lot of the things that we're asking them to do. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  And we're asking them to do a lot of things [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=219.92s)]
*  at the same time to lower drug prices [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=222.0s)]
*  and to do better safety testing [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=224.44s)]
*  and to do better efficacy testing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=227.52s)]
*  And so it's a lot, but they, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=230.52s)]
*  these are very smart people, and they're very energetic, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=232.92s)]
*  and they at least have committed to us [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=235.84s)]
*  that this is something that they wanna work with us [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=238.92s)]
*  and make sure this gets done, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=241.16s)]
*  and that they play a critical role [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=243.96s)]
*  in transitioning us from a sick care system in this country [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=247.16s)]
*  to a healthcare system, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=250.84s)]
*  and that their products are actually doing [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=252.04s)]
*  what they want them to do, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=255.12s)]
*  which is to make Americans healthy again. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=256.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one of the cases that you make, Bobby, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=259.0s)]
*  and so many others who agree with your whole Maha movement [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  is that food is responsible for making so many people sick [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=264.28s)]
*  because of the things that you're talking about, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=268.26s)]
*  but also that food can be healing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=269.96s)]
*  And one of the people that has always believed that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=271.5s)]
*  is Casey Means, who wrote Good Energy [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=274.36s)]
*  with her brother, Callie Means, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=277.0s)]
*  who's been a guest on this show many times. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=279.32s)]
*  As you know, Casey Means has been nominated [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=282.64s)]
*  for the position of Surgeon General by President Trump, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  and now there's a lot of controversy [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=287.84s)]
*  around that nomination. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  I wanna give you a chance to address some of the critiques [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  that people are making about the nomination. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  I know you stand very strongly behind it, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=298.44s)]
*  so you can make the case for that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=300.76s)]
*  I'm very, very happy and grateful to President Trump [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=305.52s)]
*  for nominating Casey as the Surgeon General. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=309.12s)]
*  The industries that are threatened by her nomination [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=314.56s)]
*  are mobilizing, and they're actually paying [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=319.36s)]
*  a lot of bloggers, we've learned now, to attack her. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=322.0s)]
*  They're attacking her mainly on the critique [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=328.4s)]
*  that she stopped practicing medicine. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=332.96s)]
*  Casey was at the top of her Stanford class, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=336.96s)]
*  she was president of her Stanford class. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=339.12s)]
*  As a resident, she won every award that you could get [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  for the kind of surgery that she was doing. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=345.23999999999995s)]
*  And she realized very early on [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=348.35999999999996s)]
*  that she was not healing patients, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=350.08s)]
*  they were coming back again and again, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=351.79999999999995s)]
*  because the surgeries were treating the symptoms [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=354.21999999999997s)]
*  and not the underlying causes. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=356.67999999999995s)]
*  And she decided to devote her life [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  to figuring out what those underlying causes were [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=362.2s)]
*  and to ending those exposures. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=365.76s)]
*  She wrote a bestselling book [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=367.32s)]
*  that really galvanized the Maha movement. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=368.64s)]
*  And Rachel, I'm very grateful to you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=371.12s)]
*  The leadership that you've shown [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=376.52s)]
*  in telling this story to the American public, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-YZM9nXfg&t=378.64s)]
