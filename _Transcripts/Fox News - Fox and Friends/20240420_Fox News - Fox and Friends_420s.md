# Where is America's youth learning anti-Israel ideology?
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A)
*  Music [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=0.0s)]
*  Break by break, break by break, wall by wall, wall by wall [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Zionism will fall, Zionism will fall [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  PDKKK, NYPDKKK, IOWF they're all the same [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  IOWF you're all the same [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=18.2s)]
*  We fought our revolution, we fought our revolution [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=20.1s)]
*  There is only one solution, there is only one solution [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=23.6s)]
*  We are Hamas [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=28.2s)]
*  You're Hamas, wow [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=29.7s)]
*  You're what? You're Hamas? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=31.7s)]
*  Yes, we're all Hamas, hey [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=34.2s)]
*  Massive anti-Israel protests breaking out on and around Ivy League campuses right here in the United States [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=38.7s)]
*  So where is America's youth learning this ideology? Let's go off the wall to find out [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=45.7s)]
*  By the way, I think there are 22 Arab nations in the world [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=50.7s)]
*  Fully Islamic nations where it's basically not legal to be a Christian or a Jew [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=54.7s)]
*  There's one Jewish state and all of these people protesting in cities like New York City think it doesn't have a right to exist [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=60.7s)]
*  This is New York City to Pete's point, this is around Columbia University [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=67.7s)]
*  These are protesters outside on the streets, there was a sit-in, a hunger strike at Yale and then a sit-in at Columbia [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=71.2s)]
*  And you saw some of those horrific, not just sympathizing, but allegiances thrown in with Hamas [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=78.7s)]
*  Absolutely, we've seen Hezbollah flags and we see things like Intifada revolution [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=84.2s)]
*  Well, Intifada is a violent uprising, that's what October 7th was [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=90.2s)]
*  These groups are openly stating, wearing the colors of Islamists, we want the state of Israel gone, replace it with something else [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=94.2s)]
*  Well, in order to replace it, you've got to get rid of and kill those people, that's what they're calling for [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=102.2s)]
*  It's not just college students by the way, it's recent grads, this is the workforce, this is at Google [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=106.7s)]
*  You can see in California where this week 28 employees were fired because they disrupted the workplace [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=112.2s)]
*  They took over the cloud president's office, sat in, they did learn a hard lesson by the way [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=119.2s)]
*  The free speech protects you from the government and in public places, not at your place of work [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=124.7s)]
*  It was good to see that Google actually fired them, in most cases companies allow this, you know, we see it in the White House, right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=129.2s)]
*  The letters from the junior staffers to the senior officials saying, we want more support for Palestine [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=137.7s)]
*  And this comes back to younger people, Will [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=143.2s)]
*  It's a younger generation because of the information, the ideology, the indoctrination they're getting in their high schools and universities [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=145.2s)]
*  So the numbers are changing in this country [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=152.2s)]
*  Here's what the numbers look like, a lot on your screen here, but we'll point out [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=153.7s)]
*  This is where the sympathies of younger adults lie, and so you got it breaking down by age group here [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=156.7s)]
*  And let's just say, Israel, support Palestinians [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=163.2s)]
*  So you can see 50 years old to 64, 39% with Israel, 10% with the people of Palestine [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=167.2s)]
*  But look at 18 to 29, 14% with Israel, 33% more sympathy for the people of Palestine [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=174.7s)]
*  Big time, upside down, this is the age group of people that are coming out of our high schools [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=181.2s)]
*  Which as we know have been taken over by leftists, but also major universities with very particular points of view [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=185.2s)]
*  A lot of funding from outside groups who make the cause of the Palestinians romantic [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=191.7s)]
*  And make the cause of the view of Israelis to be a colonizer state [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=196.7s)]
*  That's how they portray it [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=202.7s)]
*  A lot of this falls back on critical theory ideas [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=204.7s)]
*  The idea is essentially it could be white and minorities [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=206.7s)]
*  Israel is seen as the whiter state, but also as you pointed out, the oppressor state [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=212.7s)]
*  And this is the victimhood class [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=217.2s)]
*  So a lot of this stuff is baked in and has been for decades on how you wind up in some place like this [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=219.2s)]
*  Absolutely, a lot of those young people never opened up a bible [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=223.7s)]
*  There's a lot in there, a lot of stories in there, a lot of things to portray to that part of the world [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=225.7s)]
*  So if you want to play the who was their first game, which they always love to talk about indigenous people [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=230.7s)]
*  That might be a reference, but that's not in any of these classrooms, so they're not looking at it [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=235.7s)]
*  You can see also how young people view, whether or not discrimination against Jews has increased since October 7th [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=239.7s)]
*  And you can see that it's lower again among younger people and older people in recognizing the increase in anti-Semitism [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=246.2s)]
*  Because these people are looking at the signs and hearing the chants for what they are [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=253.2s)]
*  From the river to the sea is meant to be intimidation [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=257.2s)]
*  These protests are meant to be intimidation [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=261.2s)]
*  Getting in the face of young people, whether they're Jews or not, saying if you're not with us, you're against us [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=263.2s)]
*  And our cause is to get rid of the Jewish state [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=269.2s)]
*  ADL put out a report card showing how different universities have graded out when it comes to college campus environment towards Jews [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=272.7s)]
*  And you can see, look here, I mean, here's your Ivy Leagues right here, Harvard, MIT, F [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=280.7s)]
*  F all the way, ADL by the way a big time lefty organization at this point [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=286.7s)]
*  But they're pointing out where it is Tufts, University of Chicago, all the way down to UVA, down to Virginia [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=290.7s)]
*  It's across the country, we just picked a few, very few that are doing it well [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=296.7s)]
*  And they're also encouraging their students to, I don't know, look at both sides [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=301.2s)]
*  And why does that happen? Because yes, the kids are activists, Will, but the professors in a lot of places are driving the train [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=305.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, here's some of the examples that have been reported over the last couple of months [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=311.2s)]
*  Controversial statements made on campuses, Joseph Massad, Columbia, remarks praising the Hamas attack [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=315.2s)]
*  Muhammed Abud, or Abdu, I mean, supportive statements about Hamas and Hezbollah [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=322.2s)]
*  And then there's the terrorist organizations whose charters, the charters specifically call for the destruction of all Jews and the state of Israel [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=328.7s)]
*  That's, their flags, their causes, they're all clear about it [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=335.7s)]
*  Catherine Frank alleged discriminatory comments against Israeli students [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=339.7s)]
*  Saeed Hossein at Princeton, keys of endorsing Hezbollah [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=343.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, again, you've got to look at the funding behind a lot of where these professors are getting their, their seats [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=347.7s)]
*  And there's different departments that come along with that [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=353.7s)]
*  The money's coming from the UAE and other places with very different views, not as much funding in support of, say, the Jewish cause [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=356.2s)]
*  Yeah, Penn as well, and Norton, allegations of anti, of sharing anti-Semitic content [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=363.2s)]
*  So, you have an ideological movement that's taken place over decades with critical theory [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=368.2s)]
*  You have current professorships and, and lecturers feeding the ideology [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=373.2s)]
*  And then you, it should be no surprise, you end up with a report card of F's and students doing those types of things on campus [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=378.2s)]
*  And what impact will that have on our policy in the future? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=383.7s)]
*  Look at how much it's already rattled this White House because of a few voters in Michigan [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=386.7s)]
*  The whole dynamic changes if it stops being a bipartisan consensus in support of the state of Israel [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=390.7s)]
*  Alright, Dr. Sapphire, Nicole, over to you [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=396.7s)]
*  Well, these academic institutions spreading anti-Semitism and hate all while their tuition continues to go up and up and up [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=399.7s)]
*  Making it unaffordable to many Americans [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=405.7s)]
*  Right [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=407.7s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=408.7s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1A1Pmtc5A&t=409.7s)]
