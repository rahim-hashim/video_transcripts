# Biden defends timing of 2024 exit: 'Wouldn't have mattered'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY)
*  All right, let's talk about what's happening locally. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=0.0s)]
*  Finally, Joe Biden's coming out, speaking out, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=2.12s)]
*  yesterday to the BBC. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=5.2s)]
*  Yeah, he had an interview, and they were asking [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=6.76s)]
*  about his decision to get out of the race. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=8.48s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=10.6s)]
*  Should you have withdrawn earlier, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=12.68s)]
*  given someone else a bigger chance? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=15.0s)]
*  I don't think it would have mattered. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=16.64s)]
*  We left at a time when we had a good candidate. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=22.8s)]
*  She was fully funded. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=29.36s)]
*  And what happened was, I had become what we had set out [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=32.28s)]
*  to do, no one thought we could do. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  And it had become so successful, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=42.12s)]
*  our agenda was hard to say, now I'm going to stop now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  I meant what I said when I started, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=47.64s)]
*  that I think I'm prepared to hand this [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=49.92s)]
*  to the next generation, the transition government. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=52.68s)]
*  But things moved so quickly that it [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=56.56s)]
*  made it difficult to walk away. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  I mean, just listen to him. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=63.24s)]
*  I mean, his breathing is out of control right now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=65.04s)]
*  He can barely complete the sentence. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  He's stumbling there. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=70.68s)]
*  And I do think, to his credit, there [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=72.08s)]
*  was a plan to pass the torch. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=74.4s)]
*  He said he was just going to be a transitional president, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=76.92s)]
*  but they realized that Kamala Harris couldn't win, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=79.12s)]
*  which is why he wasn't going to endorse her [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=81.2s)]
*  and pass the torch at first. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=83.04s)]
*  Lawrence, if he was going to pass the torch, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=86.08s)]
*  there would have been a primary. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=88.96s)]
*  And a vice president like George H.W. Bush, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=90.24s)]
*  even though Reagan was successful, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=92.2s)]
*  he had to go earn the nomination. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=93.56s)]
*  No one anointed him. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=95.2s)]
*  And he, by the way, says, I meant [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=96.88s)]
*  what I said when I started, I'm prepared to hand this [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=98.56s)]
*  to the next generation. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  But things moved so quickly. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=101.84s)]
*  What are you kidding me? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=103.4s)]
*  You worked an hour a day. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=104.4s)]
*  You had plenty of time to reflect and say, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=105.72s)]
*  this is the perfect moment to get out [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=107.88s)]
*  and to finish off in four years and try [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=110.08s)]
*  to end up on a high note and let this thing fight out. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=111.92s)]
*  Also, what does it say, does he think about Kamala Harris? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=114.28s)]
*  If I gave her more time, she had plenty of money, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=116.88s)]
*  she still wouldn't have won? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=118.6s)]
*  Is that what you say? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=119.72s)]
*  Well, he bowed out after that debate. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=120.76s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=123.6s)]
*  It wasn't time was moving fast. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=124.6s)]
*  He did such a terrible job on June 27th in that debate. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=126.88s)]
*  Then he bowed out about a month later, July 21st. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=130.12s)]
*  Kamala had 106 days to campaign and eventually [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=133.04s)]
*  lost to Donald Trump. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=136.24s)]
*  She raised $1 billion during that period. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=137.16s)]
*  So not only did she get the other money, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=139.72s)]
*  she also raised another billion dollars. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=141.56s)]
*  And she still lost. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=143.8s)]
*  She became the first Democratic presidential candidate [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  in 20 years to lose the popular vote and the electoral vote. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=147.24s)]
*  Pretty amazing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=151.96s)]
*  And also, he was very critical of President Trump. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=152.68s)]
*  He says he's appeasing Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=154.72s)]
*  He said, you cannot just allow him just to get land. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=156.68s)]
*  Well, what did you do? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  You just allowed it to happen. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  No F-16s got F-16s. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=163.68s)]
*  No high mars got high mars. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  No attackums got attackums. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  They stopped everybody else from bringing in more weapons [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=168.28s)]
*  to make them successful. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  So just bleed them out. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=172.12s)]
*  That was his policy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=173.4s)]
*  Many people would argue that when he said, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=174.28s)]
*  what did he say? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  A minor incursion at first? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  Did he allow a minor? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=178.68s)]
*  And then that's when Putin attacked. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=180.08s)]
*  So I don't think he should be trying to quarterback now [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=181.72000000000003s)]
*  after allowing it to happen. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  He said he was going to fall in three days [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  and offer him a ride out. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=186.12s)]
*  And Zelensky famously said, I need weapons. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't need a ride. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=189.44000000000003s)]
*  So he's the last person to talk about Ukraine. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=190.8s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=194.8s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPYbAZ8R3TY&t=195.68s)]
