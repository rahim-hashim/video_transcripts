# Five key ex-Biden aides asked to testify in Congress
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc)
*  So Republican lawmakers are demanding answers from President Biden's physician and other former White House officials over what [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=0.0s)]
*  They knew when they knew it regarding from President Biden's health issues. Yeah senior White House correspondent [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=7.16s)]
*  The younger Peter Ducey joins us now with more Peter [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=14.56s)]
*  Good morning and the small group of staffers that formed a tight [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=19.6s)]
*  Circle around Joe Biden for his one and only term all just got letters from the House Oversight Committee to come in and explain [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=24.28s)]
*  What they did or did not do to conceal his decline from the American public [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=30.84s)]
*  So the following Biden folks go check your mail his former physician [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=36.72s)]
*  Dr. Kevin O'Connor the former director of the Domestic Policy Council [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=41.88s)]
*  Neera Tanden the former assistant to the president and chief of staff to the First Lady Anthony Bernal [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  The former assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini and the former deputy assistant to the president and director of strategic [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=50.42s)]
*  outreach Ashley Williams [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=57.580000000000005s)]
*  They're behind the scenes they fly under the radar [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=62.900000000000006s)]
*  These are the unelected bureaucrats that we believe had an overwhelming influence [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=65.94s)]
*  Over Joe Biden and could have possibly be been serving as de facto [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=72.02000000000001s)]
*  presidents of the United States [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=76.78s)]
*  Well now one of the most legendary democratic thinkers of the last century believes that nothing [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=78.34s)]
*  Coming out this week should be that big of a surprise because the American people told pollsters. It was a problem two years ago [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=83.5s)]
*  I [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=90.86s)]
*  Think that Jake in those book. I mean it was a good book [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=92.38000000000001s)]
*  But to me it was a water's wet book it like I said 80% of the country [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=96.30000000000001s)]
*  I'll never forget in May of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  2023 to be exact I saw a Washington Post ABC poll and I went this is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=104.7s)]
*  It had never changed. I [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=111.46s)]
*  Asked Caroline Levitt if President Trump has followed up yet with folks that work in the offices here or that work in the residence [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=113.82s)]
*  To I find some kind of files or some kind of backup [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=121.38s)]
*  To all of these Republican assertions that there were these de facto presidents and she said that he is not yet [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=125.14s)]
*  Like to you [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=132.01999999999998s)]
*  Peter a scandal continues. I [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=133.54s)]
*  Think this is the right move and needs to happen. It's important [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=136.94s)]
*  We need to figure out who was running the White House [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=140.18s)]
*  Yeah, when did they know the president was in decline everybody needs to be sworn under oath [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=142.62s)]
*  And people should lose their jobs the next job. They want they shouldn't be hired as analysts [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=148.73999999999998s)]
*  They shouldn't be hired at these big consulting firms or defense contracting jobs as well [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=154.1s)]
*  They concealed the president's health and honestly the more and more we're learning from the book [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=159.38s)]
*  It is clear. No one told Joe Biden that he had lost a step [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=163.62s)]
*  That's normal [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=168.62s)]
*  That is normal in some point in time for someone to be a denial of their health situation when I have the mentor or any [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=169.7s)]
*  Type of cognitive decline but it's up to the family and the people that surround the person and let them know [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=176.2s)]
*  No one told the president [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=181.22s)]
*  Although I do want to point out that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=182.82s)]
*  President Biden had his faculties when he was a United States senator and took classified [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=184.5s)]
*  Documents who also had his faculties when he was the vice president [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=189.61999999999998s)]
*  He also took classified information and then he also had his mental faculties when he told his ghostwriter in 2017 that he knew he [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=192.57999999999998s)]
*  Had classified information so he is in the wrong here and he should have been charged in my opinion [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=199.17999999999998s)]
*  But I think what's why well first of all infuriates me that Jake Tapper is making money off this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=202.94s)]
*  He was part of that conspiracy and cover-up [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=206.85999999999999s)]
*  But besides that point what's what's crazy to me is this all began back in like 2019 [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=208.66s)]
*  For the 2020 campaign he had already he forgot an AIDS name that he has known since [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=214.5s)]
*  1981 Joey [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=220.54s)]
*  Yeah, you know the Constitution specifies the minimum age a president has to be so even the founders took into account [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=221.5s)]
*  mental acuity and maturity [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=228.26s)]
*  I don't think they were as concerned about the latter end because quite frankly that long ago you didn't live as long [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=229.85999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's just true the truth of it [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=235.29999999999998s)]
*  And I don't know if it's legislation obviously the idea of any type of constitutional amendment at this point as divided as we are [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=236.82s)]
*  Probably pretty thin but I feel like the real consequence here needs to be a piece of legislation that says we have more access [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=242.82s)]
*  To the medical records of a presidential candidate [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=250.45999999999998s)]
*  I understand HIPAA and I believe in privacy 100% [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  But only one person gets to be president only a couple or a handful get to run for it and you got to give up [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=255.82s)]
*  Something to have that opportunity and responsibility the real problem here [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=260.74s)]
*  If you take all the politics all the partisan parts away [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=265.32s)]
*  Regardless if you like what was happening under President Biden or not the real problem is can a group of people [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=268.38s)]
*  lie to the American people and put a charade in front of the American people and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=273.97999999999996s)]
*  Convince the American people to vote and put their trust and faith in someone to lead their country for now or four more years [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=278.34s)]
*  When that person couldn't lead his own daily schedule, and that's not even belittling Joe Biden [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=284.82s)]
*  That's being honest about the state that now we're learning [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=290.7s)]
*  Everyone knew he was in and they concealed it from American people. So the Democrats have two problems [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=293.86s)]
*  They have the the Biden problem of lying to the American people for looks like almost a decade [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=298.34s)]
*  Yeah that he's been in decline [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=303.86s)]
*  They lied to the American people on that [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=305.34s)]
*  The other part is they have an identity crisis and they don't ought to communicate to the American people on [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=306.5s)]
*  basic things and they're looking for their next Joe Rogan since they pushed them out of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=311.74s)]
*  The party but they're trying to throw money at it and the New York Times put it this way [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=316.78s)]
*  The quiet effort amounts to an audacious skeptic might say desperate [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=321.82s)]
*  But that the Democrats can buy more cultural relevance online despite the fact that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  Casually right-leaning touchstones like mr. Rogan's podcast were not built by political donors and did not [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=330.94s)]
*  Rise did not raise overnight [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=338.29999999999995s)]
*  They want to give money to this issue, but it's not organic Lisa exactly and that's their problem [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=342.26s)]
*  We were speaking earlier in the show it's not the messenger. It's the message of the Democrat Party. It's their ideas [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=348.54s)]
*  It's the thing that Americans categorically reject some of these things like men and women's sports [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=355.14s)]
*  They reject the idea of open borders and a lot of it. We're just talking about like the basics, right? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=359.98s)]
*  You know President Trump he initiated a very common-sense campaign and I think that's why he won the popular vote [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=365.14s)]
*  I think that's why he won so many different groups of people because they're like yeah, that makes sense [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=372.7s)]
*  I want sanity to be restored in America. Yeah, let's listen to what Joe Rogan had to say about it [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=376.74s)]
*  I'm sure they're scrambling to try to create their own version of this show [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=382.58s)]
*  This is one thing that keeps coming up like we need our own Joe Rogan, right, but they had me [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=387.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah real quick I want to point this out maybe I'm a contrarian here I don't think so it's not in my opinion [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=394.7s)]
*  We've you ever played the board game risk if you take ground and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=400.94s)]
*  Defend the ground you have there's no ground to be taken back that other side just loses ground [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=405.62s)]
*  What's happened with the left is Joe Rogan and Elon Musk didn't move towards the right [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=409.94s)]
*  It's just what they believe then through Trump [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=414.98s)]
*  The right has adopted or brought forward as a part of their messaging the Democrats haven't lost ground in individuals [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=417.66s)]
*  They've lost ground on issues all across the board [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=423.62s)]
*  They can't manufacture a spokesperson for a message that doesn't exist when the Republicans say we don't trust the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=425.94s)]
*  Pharmaceutical industry when the Republicans say that we want people to have more access to information [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=433.98s)]
*  Those are things that are generally looked at as a liberal ideal when the Republican Party has embraced [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=439.5s)]
*  Liberalism as a part of its Big Ten. What does the left have left other than crazy? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=444.94s)]
*  But the thing is podcasts weren't supposed to be a part of a political operation [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=449.78s)]
*  Operation supposed to be about conversations [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=453.54s)]
*  And talking with people and being able to talk for three hours about something and getting rid of the talking points [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=456.14s)]
*  I think the problem with the Democratic Party is that they have no authenticity [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=462.02s)]
*  Yeah, and they believe there's only one way of thinking they hate disagreement [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=464.9s)]
*  They hate thorough debate and they suppress the bed [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=468.46s)]
*  Which is why you got idiots on college campuses when other people have different views they shut them down [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=471.1s)]
*  Well, and I think the reason why the Democrat Party is struggling so badly with President Trump in office [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=476.18s)]
*  Is they still have that myopic Washington DC viewpoint and you can't put President Trump in any sort of box [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=481.62s)]
*  You can't put him in the Republican box. You can't put him in the Democrat box. He is totally unprecedented [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=487.02s)]
*  He is a new paradigm [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=491.09999999999997s)]
*  And so that's why they're struggling to try to figure out how to go after him because to Joey's point [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=492.18s)]
*  He he created his own thing [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDeLtS0PvMc&t=496.94s)]
