# Camping World's huge American flags trigger lawsuits
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM)
*  So the CEO of Camping World refusing to back down as the company faces lawsuits in Tennessee and North Carolina over giant American flags at his RV dealerships. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=0.0s)]
*  Camping World CEO Marcos Limonis joins us now. Marcos, what's the problem here? They say it's too big? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=11.0s)]
*  Well, they really believe that it just violates the local ordinance and the ordinance has really restricted the size of the flag and the size of the pole as well. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=17.0s)]
*  And we've had these flags up for, gosh, I don't know, 20 years. So it's surprising to me in states like North Carolina and Tennessee that I'm dealing with this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=27.0s)]
*  Right. So Tennessee statement says to send the lawsuit. Let's be clear. The issue has never been about the flag. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=35.0s)]
*  Our community is proudly American and patriotism runs deep in Severville. The display of the flag is not only welcomed, it's celebrated. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=41.0s)]
*  The concern at hand is the height of the flagpole, which exceeds the city's longstanding zoning regulations by 200 percent. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=48.0s)]
*  What's your reaction? Well, there's a pole across the street for a business that allows people to know where to get off, and that's about a similar height. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=55.0s)]
*  When we came to Severville and moved from Knoxville to open up the store, nobody minded that we were going to spend 20 million dollars generating tax revenue in their property. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=63.0s)]
*  So it's a little odd to me that we're hearing about this now. From my perspective, the flag's not a problem. It's not providing any safety. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=72.0s)]
*  It has FAA clearance. And for me, this just feels like an opportunity for the city to say we want to control what's happening there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=79.0s)]
*  And Marcus, your self-made success story, but you want to give back to the country. You said this is your love letter to the country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=85.0s)]
*  You have a goal of spreading a million flags across this country. Well, we have 704,000 square feet of flags. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=92.0s)]
*  So the flag you see on your screen is 3,200 square feet. I've had them up for 20 years. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=101.0s)]
*  I'm about three quarters of the way there. When we get to a million square feet, I feel like I've accomplished my goal. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=106.0s)]
*  Why? Why does it mean so much? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=111.0s)]
*  You know what? I wasn't born in this country. I was immigrated from Beirut, Lebanon, came here to Miami, Florida, and had an opportunity to live the American dream in this country. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=113.0s)]
*  And I've put a lot of sweat and tears into building this business for my people, for the country. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=123.0s)]
*  And it's my love letter to tell everybody how grateful I am that this country provided me an opportunity where it didn't have to, to make money, to be a capitalist, to provide jobs in America. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=128.0s)]
*  And as people I've told people before, this flag is not coming down. This is the third city in the last several years that have tried to sue us to take the flag down, threatening jail, a variety of other fines. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=139.0s)]
*  You know, I want my legacy to stand for something. And this is one of those things. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=151.0s)]
*  And you helped so many people. I loved your show on TV. And I see how you're always trying to give back and grow other success stories. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=155.0s)]
*  Marcus, hope you win this. Your heart's certainly in the right place. Thank you. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg7_7NYi9vM&t=162.0s)]
