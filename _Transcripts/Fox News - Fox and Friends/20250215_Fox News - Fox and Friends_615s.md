# Musk's DOGE lays off 3,600 probationary HHS employees, saves $600M annually
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI)
*  Well, listen to this, speaking of not laying hands, but laying people off. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=0.0s)]
*  Or hangovers that are not going to go away. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=6.92s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=9.16s)]
*  Well, Doge this week is laying off, get this, 3,600 probationary employees. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=10.16s)]
*  4,000 employees retained, and so then the savings is $600 million. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=17.32s)]
*  So I guess a probationary doesn't mean they're on probation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=24.76s)]
*  It means that they were just recently hired and they're during this probationary period, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=28.32s)]
*  which makes it easier for Doge and the government to let go of them if they decide that their [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=32.28s)]
*  jobs are not necessary. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=38.24s)]
*  Well, and this is a guy with Elon Musk we saw when he took over Twitter. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=39.6s)]
*  I mean, he slashed a lot of the employees. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=43.04s)]
*  It's still running just fine. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  But the biggest problem where we are now as a country with our federal government, it's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  too big. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=49.96s)]
*  This is not supposed, this is not the original vision of America. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=51.24s)]
*  We were supposed to have a decentralized government. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=54.44s)]
*  That was the whole vision of the founding father. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=57.0s)]
*  So what we have now is the antithesis of what America is supposed to be. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=58.68s)]
*  And when government becomes so centralized and so big, it becomes corrupt. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=62.16s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=66.6s)]
*  And that's what we saw with the Biden administration going after people under the FACE Act, going [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=67.6s)]
*  after its political opponents without fear. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=71.44s)]
*  And so what this election is about is the American people taking their power back. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=74.16s)]
*  It's a we the people election. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=78.44s)]
*  And we're seeing a we the people administration. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=80.08s)]
*  I think probably one of the most shocking things have been the things that we saw happening [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=81.88s)]
*  at USAID, which, by the way, we're going to have Glenn Greenwald on tomorrow and we're [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  going to talk about that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=89.2s)]
*  Who knew that so much money was being spent? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=90.48s)]
*  I mean, we knew there was regime change operations going on, but they were to the tune of billions [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=92.88s)]
*  and billions and billions of dollars doing the work of the CIA through USAID. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=98.12s)]
*  And nobody really it was very opaque. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=103.2s)]
*  Nobody knew what was going on. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=105.08s)]
*  It's also was going to NGOs. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=106.08s)]
*  And we saw Hillary Clinton's daughter receiving a lot of money. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=108.36s)]
*  There was a lot of things that have come up. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=112.52s)]
*  And I think the American people and you see the polling are on board with this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=115.12s)]
*  It's hard to believe that these Democrats think they can sing their way out of this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=120.08s)]
*  because the American people are on board with it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=125.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=128.0s)]
*  Who is who would possibly be against making the government more efficient? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=128.8s)]
*  And as much as we'd like to just snap our fingers and fix all of it, the truth of the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=132.72s)]
*  matter is it's going to happen by not hiring new employees, by extending buyouts to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=136.16s)]
*  current employees. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=142.88s)]
*  It's going to be a gradual thing, but it's going to make it more efficient. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=143.92s)]
*  But what is snapping your finger is the Trump administration is finding all of these [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=147.12s)]
*  giant pots of gold that the Biden administration was hiding all over the place. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=153.04s)]
*  Most recently, one point nine billion in HUD money was just recovered after being [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=158.28s)]
*  misplaced, misplaced air quotes during the Biden administration due to a broken process. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  These funds were earmarked for the administration of financial services, but are no [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=168.72s)]
*  longer needed. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  Secretary Turner and Doge worked together to fix the issue and de obligated the funds, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=172.92s)]
*  which are now available for other use by the Treasury. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=178.72s)]
*  The federal government is these agencies. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=182.12s)]
*  They're the only any company on earth that operated like this would go out of business. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=184.16s)]
*  And the people that ran the company would be put in jail. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=190.16s)]
*  What was the number again? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=192.92s)]
*  Was that one point nine? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=193.84s)]
*  That's like if we lifted the couch, right pillow cushions up here and we found one point [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=195.92s)]
*  eight billion dollars. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=201.04s)]
*  I remember I know how happy I get when I when I when I put my hand in a pocket and I go, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=201.88s)]
*  oh, my God, there's a five dollar bill. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=206.6s)]
*  I feel like I'm rich. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=208.08s)]
*  This is what's happening all over the map. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=209.76s)]
*  We're finding money under the cushions in your pockets. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=212.36s)]
*  And it's just sitting there getting either about to get funneled off to some NGO to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=215.76s)]
*  employ, you know, Democrats in the next four years. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=220.12s)]
*  Or it's getting sent somewhere else or it's getting or it's going into the hands of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=223.56s)]
*  criminals because there's all these networks that have been set up to defraud us. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  We heard about the money that was being sent overseas as well and fraudulent payments of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  Social Security. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=237.28s)]
*  And in a lot of instances, these NGOs are working against American interests. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=238.52s)]
*  And we've seen a lot of these aiding and abetting basically human trafficking with, you [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=241.96s)]
*  know, these legal aliens over the border as well. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  So I mean, you think about it, too. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's like a trillion dollars a year just on the interest on our debt alone. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  Right. So we're over thirty six trillion dollars in debt. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  So even though with Doge and all the savings that they're trying to find, we're just [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=258.12s)]
*  scratching the surface. That's how bad things have gone. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=261.12s)]
*  But finally, they're taking this seriously. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=263.88s)]
*  And Democrats have been complaining, saying, well, it's not that much money. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=265.96s)]
*  I mean, I don't see the clock turning on the debt on the debt. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=269.35999999999996s)]
*  It's like every little bit counts. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  Meanwhile, I mean, here are the here are the boomers, the aging boomers singing [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=275.35999999999996s)]
*  about how horrible it is that we just found one point eight billion dollars under the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=280.76s)]
*  couch cushion today. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=284.0s)]
*  Listen. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=286.2s)]
*  I will lift you up when they push you down. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=287.72s)]
*  I will raise my voice and stand my ground. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=291.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, it looks like it might be a hard road, but I'm going to walk it with you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=295.36s)]
*  That's not the worst version we've heard, though. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=302.32000000000005s)]
*  Right. They're pretty bad. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=306.0s)]
*  I've heard worse by the. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  They get worse and worse. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=309.44000000000005s)]
*  My favorite is all the clips from the hearings, like especially Pete's and like [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=310.8s)]
*  the Democrat members just like yelling at him. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=315.44s)]
*  And they and they and they think that they're reliving the civil rights movement, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=318.44s)]
*  which I think is really funny because this is a civil rights movement. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=321.96s)]
*  This is their civil rights. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=324.8s)]
*  Civil federal employees who are unionized shouldn't be unionized, by the way. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=326.16s)]
*  But there are civil workers, bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=332.0s)]
*  who's who spend all of your money, all of it paid for by you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=336.28s)]
*  And by the way, even if you know, even if you were to make it [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=341.68s)]
*  as efficient as possible, a lot of them are doing things that we don't need [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=345.64s)]
*  that actually make life more terrible for people. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=349.4s)]
*  And there are people that are doing great stuff. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=352.88s)]
*  So let's keep the people that are doing the good stuff, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=355.2s)]
*  they keep the trains running, they keep the the system running [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=357.28s)]
*  and the and the checks paid to the military and the checks paid to our veterans. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=360.03999999999996s)]
*  We need all that. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=363.32s)]
*  Let's let's streamline, get rid of all the waste, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=364.35999999999996s)]
*  find all these pots of money that are getting wasted away. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=366.88s)]
*  I don't see how anybody could be against it, but one of the tactics [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  that they're using besides singing is trying to separate [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=373.56s)]
*  Elon Musk and Donald Trump, this this bro romance. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=377.04s)]
*  That's bromance, bromance, bromance. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=381.8s)]
*  That's been going on. Here's President Trump talking about it to Sean Hannity. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=384.20000000000005s)]
*  This is a tease, you guys, because next week, the whole interview [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=388.0s)]
*  with Elon Musk and Donald Trump will air on Sean Hannity's show on Tuesday night. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=391.32s)]
*  But here's here's here's Donald Trump talking about this tactic. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=395.96000000000004s)]
*  You're both aware, you have to be keenly aware [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  that the media and and the punditry class, not that, you know, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=404.72s)]
*  I think you've proven they have no power anymore [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=409.76s)]
*  because they threw everything they had at you and they didn't win. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=412.88s)]
*  And that was, you know, the New York Times, Washington Post, three networks, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=415.72s)]
*  every late night comedy show, two cable channels. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=420.44s)]
*  They just they threw everything, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  weaponization. Sure. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=425.92s)]
*  And now I see they want you two to start. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=428.12s)]
*  They want a divorce. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=432.04s)]
*  They want you two to start hating each other. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=433.08s)]
*  And they try all President Elon Musk, for example. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=435.52s)]
*  You do know that they're doing that to you. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=439.28s)]
*  Oh, I see it all the time. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=441.2s)]
*  They tried it. Then they stopped. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=442.36s)]
*  That was over. They have many different things of hatred. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=444.28s)]
*  Actually, Elon called me, said, you know, they're trying to drive us apart. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=447.64s)]
*  I said absolutely. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=452.08s)]
*  No, they said we have breaking news. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=453.32s)]
*  Donald Trump has ceded control of the presidency to Elon Musk. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=455.48s)]
*  President Musk will be attending a cabinet meeting tonight at eight o'clock. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  And I say, it's just so obvious. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  They're so bad at it. I used to think they were good at it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=467.04s)]
*  They're actually bad at it, because if they were good at it, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=469.68s)]
*  I'd never be president, because I think nobody in history [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=472.0s)]
*  has ever gotten more bad publicity than me. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=475.71999999999997s)]
*  I could do the greatest things. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=478.36s)]
*  I get 98 percent bad publicity. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=480.52s)]
*  I could do outside of you, a few of your very good friends. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=482.6s)]
*  It's like the craziest thing. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  But you know what I have learned, Elon, that people are smart. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=488.20000000000005s)]
*  They get it. Yeah, they do. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=490.72s)]
*  They get it. They really see what's happening. Yes. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=492.68s)]
*  So what I love about what's happening right now with this [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=496.04s)]
*  and then there you see Tuesday at 9 p.m. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=498.40000000000003s)]
*  with Sean Hannity, that's going to be a must watch TV right there. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=500.28000000000003s)]
*  But what I love about this [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=503.76000000000005s)]
*  this administration and President Trump is that he's an outsider. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=505.0s)]
*  And for far too long, we've had people like Joe Biden, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=508.6s)]
*  who's he was been government for 50 years. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=510.8s)]
*  I forget even how long. Right. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=512.72s)]
*  So how can you fix government when it's all, you know, when you're [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=514.04s)]
*  you're insulated from the bad policy decisions that you've made. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=516.96s)]
*  And so what I love about this is you have all these outsiders [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=520.56s)]
*  going in, all these disruptors who are taking a fresh viewpoint [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=523.36s)]
*  of government and how to fix it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=526.76s)]
*  And you see that with Elon going through this nonsense at USAID [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=528.04s)]
*  that you're pointing out, Rachel, and all this stuff. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=531.96s)]
*  And he's probably going, how does the government operate like this? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=533.8s)]
*  It's a mess. He's he's running what Donald Trump is doing. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=536.88s)]
*  He's running this government like a company. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=540.4s)]
*  Yeah. Great point. Like a corporation. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=542.08s)]
*  And you have two people who are coming to it, both of whom are billionaires [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=543.52s)]
*  and have made fortunes for themselves before they came to government. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  And you have a guy like Joe Biden, who spent his entire life [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=551.6s)]
*  on a government salary in Washington, working as a as a [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=555.76s)]
*  as an employee of the federal government, as a, you know, in Congress. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=560.72s)]
*  And he leaves and his wife was a schoolteacher. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=564.84s)]
*  And they leave Washington as millionaires. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=567.68s)]
*  They've made a fortune in Washington off of their, quote, unquote, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=570.52s)]
*  service to the country. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=574.72s)]
*  And you have these two guys. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=576.04s)]
*  They don't they don't need anything. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=577.24s)]
*  They don't need to steal money from the government. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=579.04s)]
*  They don't need to use the government or their service to make money off of it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=581.24s)]
*  Yeah, that was always by the way, service means Hunter. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=585.28s)]
*  And it's always it's always using under the guise of, you know, foreign affairs, right? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=589.6s)]
*  Because Joe Biden, his family, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=593.36s)]
*  enrich themselves on all these foreign dealings. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=594.76s)]
*  You have the Clinton Foundation. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=596.76s)]
*  You have the Biden Penn Center. Right. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=598.68s)]
*  So it's always under the guise of the shadowy foreign whatever. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCoutmLkbI&t=600.8s)]
