# Angel mom hits back at Texas Democrat: This is not political
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58)
*  Vice President Kamala Harris deflecting from her role in the ongoing crisis at our border, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=0.0s)]
*  while former President Trump lays the blame on her administration. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=8.28s)]
*  The United States Congress, including some of the most conservative members of the United [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=13.1s)]
*  States Senate, came up with a border security bill, which I supported. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=16.96s)]
*  Donald Trump got on the phone, called up some folks in Congress, and said, kill the bill. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=22.32s)]
*  It is much higher because of them. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=27.36s)]
*  They allowed criminals, many, many millions of criminals. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=29.74s)]
*  They allowed terrorists. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=33.54s)]
*  They allowed common street criminals. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=34.699999999999996s)]
*  They allowed people to come in, drug dealers to come into our country. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=37.14s)]
*  One of those criminal illegal immigrants is Walter Javier Martinez. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=41.739999999999995s)]
*  There's his picture, an MS-13 member who crossed the border under Biden and Harris's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=46.54s)]
*  leadership, and then pleaded guilty to the brutal assault and murder of 20-year-old Kayla [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=51.7s)]
*  Hamilton. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=56.94s)]
*  Your mom, Tammy Nobles, joins us this morning. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=57.94s)]
*  Hi, Tammy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=60.54s)]
*  Thanks for coming on with us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=61.54s)]
*  Hi. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=64.02s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=65.22s)]
*  So her policies, Kamala Harris's decriminalized illegal crossers, cut ICE funding, free health [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=66.22s)]
*  care for illegals, stopped Trump's wall on day one. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=71.74s)]
*  She supports sanctuary cities. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=75.8s)]
*  Your daughter was killed, unfortunately, two years ago under this administration. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=78.06s)]
*  Do you trust Kamala Harris, if she becomes president, to tackle the border crisis? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=82.18s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=87.3s)]
*  It's just going to get worse. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=89.33999999999999s)]
*  If she gets elected, it is going to be a lot worse than it is now. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=90.33999999999999s)]
*  And it's just going to not be the kind of country that people want. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=96.1s)]
*  I know, Tammy, you were one of the Angel Moms invited to go speak on Capitol Hill in front [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=102.1s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=107.69999999999999s)]
*  And Congresswoman Veronica Escobar, she's a Democrat from Texas, she said this about [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=108.82s)]
*  inviting Angel Moms to talk to our leaders. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=113.66s)]
*  I think what is most frustrating to me as a member of Congress is what is happening [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=117.02s)]
*  today at this committee hearing, where we have colleagues who are exploiting people's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=124.41999999999999s)]
*  pain for political purposes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  I know you have said you were there to prevent other moms from feeling what you're feeling. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=135.22s)]
*  How do you feel about her reaction, that you're being exploited? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=140.66s)]
*  I have been to Congress several times, and I hear the same thing from her, that we're [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  being exploited and that it's a political stunt. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=152.26s)]
*  I have said it over and over that we are not being forced there. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  Nobody is forcing us to be there. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=161.73999999999998s)]
*  We want to be there. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=165.33999999999997s)]
*  I want to be there for my daughter. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=166.5s)]
*  I'm not doing it for any political reason. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=169.66s)]
*  It is for my daughter and to prevent this from happening to someone else's child. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=172.3s)]
*  There's your precious daughter. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=178.46s)]
*  That is the reason. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=179.46s)]
*  It's a safety issue. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=180.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=181.82000000000002s)]
*  Tammy, we're showing a picture of your daughter. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=182.82000000000002s)]
*  How has this administration or these policies affected your family? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=185.06s)]
*  It has affected me because of the open border, Homeland Security not doing a background check [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=190.66000000000003s)]
*  or vetting because he came over as a UAC and he was a known gang member of MS-13 and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=198.02s)]
*  had a criminal record in 2020 in El Salvador. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=207.3s)]
*  It took her murder and the local police to find that information out. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=211.54000000000002s)]
*  Tammy, I can't imagine what you've gone through as a mother, not only to lose your child, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=217.5s)]
*  but then salt on the wound when you learned that it could have been prevented. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=221.9s)]
*  This was an illegal immigrant that did this to your child. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=225.42s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=228.82s)]
*  Thank you for coming on and allowing us to hear your side. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=229.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNVobOVfi58&t=235.01999999999998s)]
