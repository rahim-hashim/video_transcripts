# AOC refuses to say whether Dem rhetoric responsible for Tesla attacks
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0)
*  You know how Democrats were so outraged about January 6th, but then they were fine with the riots in that summer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=0.0s)]
*  of everyone burning down buildings. Well now they're fine with everyone [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=7.4s)]
*  protesting and then all the violence against Tesla owners and some of the dealerships. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=12.38s)]
*  AOC was asked if, if she was pressed on this, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=17.48s)]
*  do you think that the rhetoric, the dangerous rhetoric coming out of the mouths of Democrats could [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=20.36s)]
*  contribute to what's happening for Tesla owners and dealerships? Listen to this. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=25.62s)]
*  Do you see a connection at all between the rhetoric we're hearing from Democrats on Musk and Tesla, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=30.08s)]
*  connection to the violence at all, what's happening on the streets, to Tesla dealerships? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=36.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean again, like I've, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=41.28s)]
*  I've seen Republicans call me communist. I hate this country. I mean, it's like, it's, I don't... [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=43.92s)]
*  Do you still have your Tesla? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  I was just wondering if you still have your Tesla. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  For security reasons I'm not, I'm not a Tesla. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  That's right. If someone has a Tesla, they're gonna think it's AOC. So for security reasons. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=58.62s)]
*  Here's the thing. Most Democrats had Tesla's electric cars. They were leading the purchases. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=63.5s)]
*  I'm sure if there was a box to check you'd find that out. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=68.17999999999999s)]
*  But this is one of the reasons, Steve, why I think that he might expedite him leaving earlier. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=70.46s)]
*  I don't think he anticipated this. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=75.06s)]
*  I don't think he anticipated his companies paying the price except for maybe not having a brilliant CEO day to day. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=76.62s)]
*  But now Tesla's global sales are off 13%. In Rome, they were attacked at a dealership yesterday. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  I think 44 were blown up. So they were supposed to sell projected $336,000. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=89.46s)]
*  They were off, they were supposed to deliver $396,000. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=95.1s)]
*  They delivered $336,000. How many people just are giving up these cars? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=98.86s)]
*  Because they don't like the way Elon Musk is associated with Trump. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=103.66s)]
*  Right, and so as you look at some of these images, the vandalism, and we saw at the very beginning [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=107.06s)]
*  some video we brought you yesterday where that guy reportedly had taped over one of the family's video cameras [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=112.3s)]
*  and then broke the Cybertruck. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=119.97999999999999s)]
*  Tesla is now offering a $25,000 reward. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=125.38s)]
*  The guy also left a note, hey, replace these tires after he slashed them. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=129.82s)]
*  So Tesla's making it very clear. All right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=133.94s)]
*  Not only do these cars have that sentry mode where they will take a picture of you, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  if you vandalize the cars, but also Tesla is saying, OK, we're going to go ahead and give you some cash as well. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=142.14s)]
*  Last night, I went out to dinner with my friend, Dr. Ken Remsen, and he's got one of these Teslas. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=148.7s)]
*  And he showed me how the the sentry mode works, where you push the button and it's really fascinating. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=155.1s)]
*  And then he said, watch this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=161.7s)]
*  And we were at an Italian restaurant in northern New Jersey, and he pushed a button for my home address. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=163.38s)]
*  And he said, OK, the car is going to drive us home. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=170.14000000000001s)]
*  No way. Yeah. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  And what it did was it backed out of the spot and drove through my town to my house. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=174.34s)]
*  His hand didn't touch the wheel. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=181.06s)]
*  And his foot never touched the pedal. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=182.06s)]
*  After that, I told my wife, I called Kathy and I said, I think we're going to get a Tesla. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=186.74s)]
*  So Sean bought a Tesla. He's talked about that on his show. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=190.62s)]
*  So we drove it last weekend down in Florida. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=193.18s)]
*  We went to go see The Chosen in the movie theater. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=195.06s)]
*  We're driving down the interstate and it's on auto whatever auto. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=197.94s)]
*  Yes. And he picked up his phone and to text someone. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=203.06s)]
*  I'm like, no, no, no, you can't do that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=206.02s)]
*  And the auto auto drive said shut down and said, now you have to drive for the rest of the truck. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=207.7s)]
*  So if you start texting, that's the safety mechanism. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=213.54s)]
*  Then we got out of the movie theater and Sean said, watch this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=216.02s)]
*  He picked up his phone and he did whatever. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=218.82s)]
*  The car backed out of the parking spot and came to us in front of the movie theater. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=221.02s)]
*  So self-driving. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=226.1s)]
*  And that's bad for valet guys. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=227.1s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of a couple of a couple of other things. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=229.22s)]
*  If you have a Tesla robot drive your Tesla cyber truck, technically is test. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=233.62s)]
*  Are you being is it self-driving? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=239.66s)]
*  Think about that for a second. What what is the Tesla robot? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=241.7s)]
*  Oh, it's you can see it. Oh, my goodness. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=244.62s)]
*  This is the test. Is that the one that looks like a dog? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  I mean, literally, literally. Yeah. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=249.54s)]
*  It can walk across the mountains. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=251.5s)]
*  It's amazing. It's I think when I buy it, it'll be my best friend. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=253.9s)]
*  OK. And number three is a little nugget was in our packet on Monday. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=257.06s)]
*  Uh, Neuralink within months will put a chip in brains in order to restore eyesight to the blind. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=260.9s)]
*  It's amazing. Besides that, what is he actually accomplishing? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=268.9s)]
*  Right, right. And making people with spinal injuries walk. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dBnh7BcUh0&t=271.42s)]
