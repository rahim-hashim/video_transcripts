# Trump named TIME 2024 Person of the Year
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8)
*  And also today the former president United States dropped by his towers able to stay at home last night [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=0.0s)]
*  And there's gonna be ringing the bell [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=5.34s)]
*  And go ringing the bell and he's got to be excessfully happy because we know he likes to collect magazine covers [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=7.68s)]
*  But now he doesn't have to mock one up for the second time [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=13.48s)]
*  He is Time magazine's person of the year to me there are other contenders [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=16.68s)]
*  But if they did anything but name him that would be flat-out bias [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=21.44s)]
*  Well, so time.com has just released that and I'm looking at the actual article and it's great [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=25.46s)]
*  It said and the head the sub headline is if what comes next is anything like what he promises [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=32.18s)]
*  Trump will reshape the nation and the world and that is why so many people according to polls [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=39.32s)]
*  Which we're gonna get into very shortly. People are really optimistic about the next four years. Look over the last four years [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=45.2s)]
*  Things have not gone well and people are ready for something new something better [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=51.96s)]
*  He was Time magazine's person of the year in 2016 when he won that election also up for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=56.459999999999994s)]
*  For the other contenders were Joe Rogan and Elon Musk Kate Middleton and Kamala Harris [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=62.48s)]
*  But any Benjamin Netanyahu? Well, it's right. It's hard to believe that the election was just last month and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=69.52s)]
*  I mean [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=75.52s)]
*  Exactly, I mean it and to Joe Biden's credit [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=78.24s)]
*  He's essentially stepped out of her way and allowed Donald Trump to start doing what he's doing right now [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=81.16s)]
*  And I think when you look at the other people that were considered he was the only choice [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=87.0s)]
*  I mean you can't have Kamala Harris that lost election then become the person of the year [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=91.32s)]
*  But by the way as Trump moved in, you know, he has Steve Wood cough over with the middle in the Middle East [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=95.32s)]
*  He's got Tom Homan working the border doing this [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  So he's got that going the president United States got rid of the the FBI director put so much pressure on him [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=102.56s)]
*  He actually saluted saluted the moment they set beside great day for America and he's got his nominees stealing a lot of the spotlight [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=107.64s)]
*  In Capitol Hill, so they're following him around. He's already calling the Prime Minister of Canada meeting with him [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=115.92s)]
*  But Angela, you know, what's different now? What it's not really Trump tweeting or going? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=122.12s)]
*  It's kind of like the things he's doing rather than the things he said action [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=127.36s)]
*  Yeah, he learned from mistakes four years ago. I know I think it's definitely intentional [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=131.36s)]
*  I also don't think he he's not in the middle of an investigation. No one's questioning the authenticity of his election [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=136.28s)]
*  No, they're not talking about Michael Flynn making a call from Puerto Rico and them saying he's talking to the Russians [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=141.58s)]
*  About some secret deal that talks even Federman was tweeting on truth social [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=146.92s)]
*  I think he's the first Democratic lawmaker to get on truth social and tweeted out that Donald Trump should be pardoned for the case [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=152.44s)]
*  Yeah in New York, you know what is it to your point about? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=158.84s)]
*  Why he's doing things differently last time. I think last time when he won it was kind of a surprise [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=162.04s)]
*  It's like okay. I ran for a year, but I won now. What do I do? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=167.8s)]
*  He's done it once before some mistakes are always made along the way [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=172.48s)]
*  But he's figured out how he has wanted to do it more efficiently [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=176.6s)]
*  And so far so good and at least a panic by the way got the Federman endorsement yesterday [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  That's the first time I've seen a Democrat [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, then they took a picture together and and to your point about Joe Biden just laying low [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=188.56s)]
*  he's not doing anything except an [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  Historic number of pardons and commutations over 1500 issued this morning [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=196.76s)]
*  I don't think he's gonna give us any comment about I don't think so [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=202.01999999999998s)]
*  Anyway, we're calling this the Trump effect and is in full swing the last Fox News poll of the year showing that the majority of voters [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=205.28s)]
*  Feel hopeful about his victory 54% [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=212.8s)]
*  That's right [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=216.08s)]
*  And with under six weeks until inauguration day on January 20th at noon plans are well underway [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  Including an invitation to the China President Xi Jinping to show up live in Washington [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=222.08s)]
*  If he accepted he would be the first foreign leader to ever attend. Is that right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=228.56s)]
*  That's right. The first I'm hoping it's in the script [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=234.64s)]
*  Okay [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=238.44s)]
*  And Trump's inaugural fund getting a boost from a surprising source from Mark Zuckerberg's meta [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=238.88s)]
*  donating one million dollars as the tech billionaire looks to mend ties with Trump because remember he took him off of Facebook in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=245.83999999999997s)]
*  2021 and then put him back on a few years later that tells you a lot that they're mending [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=252.83999999999997s)]
*  He grew his hair out and he started doing jujitsu [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=258.08s)]
*  Never happen he's trying to look more like Danny Penny perhaps also remember the Zucker Bucks in those key districts made of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=265.56s)]
*  put his hand on the scale with a shadow banning of the conservative groups and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=272.8s)]
*  Conservative politicians and he's not the only one putting differences aside [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=277.28s)]
*  Democratic Senator John Fetterman joining truth social to quote meet folks where they are especially in Pennsylvania [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcMTyqHGX8&t=282.4s)]
