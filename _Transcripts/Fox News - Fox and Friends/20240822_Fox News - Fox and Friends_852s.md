# Trump reacts to possible RFK Jr. endorsement: 'I would be honored'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU)
*  All right, Mr. President, yesterday there was a big announcement or big rumors spreading [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=0.0s)]
*  that RFK Jr. might be dropping out, might be endorsing you. His spokesperson said they [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  will give a live address tomorrow about his path forward. And now there are rumors that [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=9.84s)]
*  he might join you at this rally in Arizona tomorrow to announce that he's supporting [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=14.9s)]
*  you. What's the truth? Have you talked to him? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=19.32s)]
*  So I've known him for a long time. He's a, as you know, he's a little different kind [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=22.7s)]
*  of a guy, very smart guy, a very good person. If he endorsed me, I would be honored by [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=27.28s)]
*  it. I would be very honored by it. He really has his heart in the right place. He is a [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  respected person. Women love some of his policies, and I guess some people don't like some of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=40.56s)]
*  his policies. But overall, I thought the Democrats, he was a Democrat. I don't know what he is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=46.32s)]
*  right now, but he was a Democrat. They treated him very badly. I think he would have, you [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=51.24s)]
*  know, he goes around saying he would have beaten Biden in the primary. I think there was a good [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=55.76s)]
*  chance. What they did to him was what they did to Biden. They really were harsh and threw [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  him out. They wouldn't let him go to the vote. I mean, they made it impossible for him to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  compete in primaries because he was doing so well. And they basically made it impossible [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=68.8s)]
*  for him to do what I think he would have been successful. I think he would have overthrown [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=73.6s)]
*  Biden because Biden is so bad as a president. When I hear this talk about Mount Rushmore, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=77.72s)]
*  I turn off your television. If I have to read an article, I just throw it down. Mount Rushmore [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=83.44s)]
*  for this man who is the worst president in our history. He's allowed, and she is because [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  she was the board is there. Now she just, you know, she just owns that. She's allowed [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=94.4s)]
*  millions of people to come into our country. Many of these people, totally unchecked, totally [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=99.44s)]
*  unvetted. Many of these people came into our country. Think of this, from prisons and jails, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=104.68s)]
*  from mental institutions and insane asylums. And Brian, there's many terrorists coming in. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=110.28s)]
*  Many, many terrorists. There's no doubt about it. There's 99 in the FBI watch lists that are in our country right now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=115.8s)]
*  And we just talked to a sheriff that says we have more, more people turn themselves in, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=120.8s)]
*  but more gotaways than ever before with these new rules. Mr. President, they keep bringing up the fact [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=125.0s)]
*  that you, you were against the bipartisan bill that Senator Langford and Senator Murphy came up with [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=130.12s)]
*  about six months ago. You didn't want it done. What didn't you like about that bipartisan bill on the border? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=136.28s)]
*  Everything. It was no good. Millions of people in that bill, millions and millions of people would [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=142.68s)]
*  have allowed to be come in. And you know, Senator Langford hurt himself. He's a fine person. He hurt [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=149.24s)]
*  himself by even putting that forward. But more importantly, you don't need a bill. If they want [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=155.24s)]
*  to close the border. I had the best border in history. You see the numbers, you see the famous [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=160.36s)]
*  chart that probably saved my life if you want to know the truth. But the chart that I was pointing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=164.6s)]
*  to that I made a turn to the right show that they had the least number in recorded history. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=170.2s)]
*  The week that I left office, we had, by the way, the lowest inflation and we had the least number [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=176.04s)]
*  of illegal immigrants coming into our country. But you just didn't like that bill. They say that you [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=182.6s)]
*  killed the bill for political reasons. Did you kill because you wanted to do it yourself? And if you [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=185.56s)]
*  fixed the border, it would have hurt your chances getting reelected. What do you say to that? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=190.6s)]
*  Brian, I didn't want, I didn't do anything on the bill. People would ask my opinion, but I didn't do [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  anything on the bill. I think they respect my opinion. It was a terrible bill. But more [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  importantly, if they want to fix the border, they don't need a bill. The president of the United [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=202.92s)]
*  States, which is what I did, I didn't have a bill to close the border. I closed the border. I had [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=208.12s)]
*  the safest border. I had the least drugs coming into our country in 38 years. I had the least, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=214.28s)]
*  you have the human traffickers are horrible and they traffic in children and they traffic in women, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=221.8s)]
*  mostly women. But I had the lowest number of, we went after them with a vengeance. Nobody's ever [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=227.32s)]
*  gone after them. They will be very happy. I'll tell you what, they would be very happy to see these [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=234.2s)]
*  lightweights get back into office. They don't want Trump back. But I had the lowest human trafficking [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=239.72s)]
*  of children and women in the, in ever recorded ever. And you know, the internet makes it very hard [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=246.44s)]
*  because the internet that's become a business based on the internet. The internet has brought [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=253.64s)]
*  that into a modern business and it's almost as big as the drug business for these people. But I had [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=257.88s)]
*  the lowest number of drugs, everything. We had a great border. All Biden had to do is go to the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=263.8s)]
*  beach and leave it alone. We had the best people. We had guys like Tom Homan and Brandon Judd and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=269.16s)]
*  all these people. Paul has taken Brandon just places. You know, he's fantastic. All of these [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  people are, were stars and they were doing such a good job. I had a policy remain in Mexico. You [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=281.32000000000005s)]
*  couldn't come in Mexico is going crazy with me by the way, remain in Mexico. You couldn't come in. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=288.20000000000005s)]
*  The policy was so good. They ended it in the first week, no longer remain in Mexico. It was so [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=293.24s)]
*  incredible. They couldn't come in unless they got approved. We'll check them. Very few of them were [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=299.8s)]
*  able to come in because there was so many criminals. We kept criminals out. Now you have murderers, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=304.04s)]
*  drug dealers. Countries are sending from all over the world, not just South America, all over the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=309.56s)]
*  world. They're sending their killers, their murderers, their drug dealers, and their jails [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  are being emptied out into the United States of America. They are destroying our, they are [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=319.8s)]
*  destroying our country. She is a Marxist. She has no idea. She wants to have open borders. And if she [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=325.64s)]
*  got elected the next day, she'd have no drilling and she'd have open borders. So Mr. President. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=332.04s)]
*  With me it's the opposite. I get elected. I drill baby drill first day and we have closed borders. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=337.24s)]
*  And when you look at the polling, you're winning on the issue when it comes to the border. You're [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  also winning on the economy, which is why we were surprised when we found out this new data. And it [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=346.52s)]
*  shows that 818,000 jobs that the Harrison Biden administration claimed to have graded over the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=351.56s)]
*  past year, they didn't actually exist. And this has been the largest revision ever in the last 15 [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=357.4s)]
*  years. So Mr. President, was this purely incompetence? What do you think is going on here? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=364.35999999999996s)]
*  No, I think it was a fraud. 818,000 jobs. You know what that is? Almost a million jobs. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  They said they had them and they didn't have them. And I was surprised too, because I'd see their [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  job numbers. Everyone knows the economy is lousy. I'd see their job numbers. I was surprised. It was [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=380.84s)]
*  a fraud. That was absolutely a fraud. They ought to investigate themselves. And by the way, nothing [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=386.35999999999996s)]
*  will happen. But the Bureau of Labor Statistics came out with a revision because somebody leaked [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=391.96s)]
*  and when they leaked it, they had to come out and give the real numbers. They found almost a million [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=399.24s)]
*  jobs that they said that they created. That made their numbers look better. But now their numbers [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=404.52s)]
*  are horrible. The economy is bad. Inflation is killing our country. The border is ruining the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  fabric of our country. We have to get the criminals out. We have to get the people from the mental [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  institutions back to their mental institutions. Our country is being destroyed. And the press, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=421.56s)]
*  thank you for taking these calls. But you look at NBC and you look at ABC fake news and you look at [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=428.67999999999995s)]
*  all of these people, CBS, they don't even talk about the border. They don't talk about the drugs [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=435.96s)]
*  that are pouring into our country. They don't talk about the million people that they falsely [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=441.55999999999995s)]
*  reported had jobs and they don't have jobs. They don't exist. It was a total fraud. They don't [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=446.67999999999995s)]
*  really talk about it. They don't talk about Biden. The day Biden spoke that morning in Congress, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=451.55999999999995s)]
*  they said that he stole $27 million. I have not seen that story anywhere, but a very light [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=457.24s)]
*  mention, to be honest with you on Fox, a very light, much lighter than it should be. If that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=464.04s)]
*  was me that stole $27 million, it would be headlines. It wouldn't even be talking about [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=468.6s)]
*  the convention. The man stole or they say the man and the family, the morning of their convention [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=473.8s)]
*  on Monday, $27 million. They have it all documented. They don't even talk about it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=480.92s)]
*  The newspapers, the press, you did not have a story to be heard. The only one that reported [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=488.2s)]
*  a little bit about it was Fox. You're talking about the House GOP oversight committee's [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=493.48s)]
*  investigation into the Biden influence peddling schemes, Mr. President. I do want to stay on the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=497.08000000000004s)]
*  economy because it's the number one issue to voters far and away. And I want your opinion as [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=502.52000000000004s)]
*  a businessman. We get very little from Kamala Harris. Again, back to policies and how this [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=507.24s)]
*  affects Americans in the economy. Very little. But what we have gotten are things like price [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=511.72s)]
*  controls. And in the Biden Harris' proposal, Biden Harris administration's proposal, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=516.52s)]
*  taking capital gains to 45% tax. Talking about a clawback of unrealized gain. As a businessman, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=521.96s)]
*  what would that do to the economy? So just a couple of things real quick. Price [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=531.24s)]
*  controls have been used many, many times over the years, usually by dictators and all, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=536.76s)]
*  but they've been used many times. They've never ever worked. Venezuela used price controls and [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=541.08s)]
*  Venezuela got driven out. I mean, they're, you can't get a loaf of bread. Although now we're [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=545.8s)]
*  buying oil from Venezuela. Let's not even talk about that. We're now buying oil instead of using [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=550.76s)]
*  our good stuff. They don't have good, they have tar. You have to refine it. And we refined it in [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=555.8s)]
*  Houston, Texas, and that spills into the air in Houston. So Venezuela might not be as poor as it [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=560.68s)]
*  should be, but Venezuela would have made a deal with us very quickly. They were on the ends of [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=567.16s)]
*  the line. But the price controls have been used many, many times, many, many times over years. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=571.88s)]
*  Even Richard Nixon tried them. They've always led to huge inflation and lack of you. You don't get [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=579.0799999999999s)]
*  anything. You end up with empty stores. They are a disaster. 38 different cases, 38 cases were [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=585.64s)]
*  abject total failures. So that's on price controls. And just on the other, you know, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=594.28s)]
*  we have countries and companies that are multinational. You raise your taxes like that. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=599.0s)]
*  That would put us at the highest level of any country. Every one of these big multi, these, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=605.4s)]
*  these guys get paid to make profit. There's some of them are very good. Some of them aren't, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=611.08s)]

*  nice. I hope they're happy. The corporate rates like 18% there. Yeah, no, but they're not going [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=631.08s)]
*  to pay 45% because they can move to many other countries. Germany, they can move to many other [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=635.96s)]
*  companies. And by the way, those countries really want these companies to move. So when people think, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=641.64s)]
*  Oh, we're going to charge him 45%. We're going to charge him. I heard a thing. She wants to [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=648.6s)]

*  that they got up. You say, where is such and such a company? Well, they moved to Europe. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=658.0400000000001s)]
*  There's someplace in Europe. They will leave the country. We, I had it down so nice. I was able to [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=663.4s)]
*  get it down. And they wanted to raise it to 28. Yeah. I got it down from 48 to 21. I wanted to [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=670.1999999999999s)]
*  get it down to 15 or 16. But what that did is it gave the largest job spurt we've ever had. We had [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=677.8s)]
*  prior to COVID coming in, we had the strongest economy in the history of the world of any, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=684.92s)]
*  of any country. Now what happened is we had COVID. We did a great job with COVID, including all of the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=691.32s)]
*  various drugs and everything else that we got, the gowns, the mess. What we did was incredible. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=699.8000000000001s)]
*  Never. I got a lot of credit for the economy. Got a lot of credit for rebuilding the military. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=705.24s)]
*  Never got credit for that. I handed him something that was great. You know, more people died [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=709.4s)]
*  during his COVID of COVID during Biden than during Trump. And I had it during the really bad [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=715.64s)]
*  period all over the world, but we gave it back. Now he had what's called a bounce back. And this [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=722.04s)]
*  happens with all, what you do is people are staying in and then it bounces back. And he picked up all [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=728.04s)]
*  of those jobs that I created. And he tries to take credit for it. It's common in, when you have [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=736.1999999999999s)]
*  pandemics, you have what's called a bounce back. When the pandemic starts to end and when it ends, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=741.56s)]
*  people bounce back and they bounce back into the job. Those are my jobs. Those aren't his jobs. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=748.4399999999999s)]
*  They routinely bounce back. And we created the greatest job machine in the history of our country. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=753.56s)]
*  We created the greatest economy in the history of the world. It was interrupted by COVID, but even [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=760.04s)]
*  that, when I turned over, the stock market was higher than just prior to COVID coming in. It was [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=766.44s)]
*  a miracle what happened. But we will do it again and we will create the greatest economy in history. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=773.4000000000001s)]
*  If these two people take it over, this country is finished. She's a Marxist and that's where she's [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=779.32s)]
*  going to be. Open borders, no drilling. Our country will die. Mr. President, you got 75 days to [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwed7vQqEU&t=785.8800000000001s)]
