# SCOTUS SHOCKER: Sotomayor rejects argument from Justice Jackson
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc)
*  front and center for our politics going forward will be the effort by the Trump administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=0.0s)]
*  to try to curb the excesses in the federal government, including cutting spending, cutting [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=5.72s)]
*  bureaucracy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=12.84s)]
*  The Supreme Court gave him a huge win, President Trump, a huge win yesterday, striking down [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=13.84s)]
*  a lower court's, a lower court judge's injunction, freezing the administration's ability to cut, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  cuts to the federal government. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=29.12s)]
*  There was a lone dissent, Justice Kataji Brown Jackson dissenting, saying, for some reason, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=31.84s)]
*  this court sees fit to step in now and release the president's wrecking ball at the outset [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=38.3s)]
*  of this litigation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=43.96s)]
*  In my view, this decision is not only truly unfortunate, but also hubristic and senseless. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=45.24s)]
*  Lower court judges have their fingers on the pulse of what is happening on the ground and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  indisputably best positioned to determine the relevant facts. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=55.92s)]
*  I see new basis for it to conclude that the district court erred, let alone clearly so, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=59.72s)]
*  in finding that the president is attempting to fundamentally restructure the federal government, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=64.74000000000001s)]
*  which of course the president is, has the authority to do as the top of the executive [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=69.68s)]
*  branch. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=75.4s)]
*  Talk about hubristic. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=76.4s)]
*  You spoke with Jonathan Turley in the six o'clock hour this morning, always with a great [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=77.68s)]
*  reaction. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=82.0s)]
*  In particular, this was his reaction to Jackson's dissent and how this ruling is a message to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=83.08s)]
*  the lower courts. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=87.92s)]
*  Listen. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=88.92s)]
*  Sotomayor noted in her concurrences that this order simply was having agencies plan for [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=89.92s)]
*  downsizing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=96.64s)]
*  And she said, we can hardly stop that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=97.64s)]
*  Well, yeah, Jackson believes you can. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=101.12s)]
*  And this is part of a signature of what's becoming a type of judicial abandon that Jackson [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=104.76s)]
*  has towards the power of these courts. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=111.32s)]
*  The court could not be more clear. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=114.44s)]
*  This is another shot across the bow to lower courts that they've got to knock this off. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  They've got to stop with these injunctions. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=120.56s)]
*  This is six months of delay. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  It could have been much longer. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=126.52s)]
*  And the court is signaling, we're going to be on you very quickly if you continue to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=128.14s)]
*  do these types of orders. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=132.76s)]
*  Shot across the bow, says Turley. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=134.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=136.68s)]
*  At this point, I mean, really, it is, you know, whatever you call it, judicial activism, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=137.68s)]
*  what not, the American people see stuff like this and they see a effort, as we have heard [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=142.12s)]
*  of these nationwide injunctions at an unprecedented level, literally telling a president who can't [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=148.28s)]
*  that he can't exercise the powers given to him in the Constitution. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=154.96s)]
*  It reminds me of my favorite recent Babylon B headlines saying that President Trump resigned [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=159.24s)]
*  the presidency to become a lower federal court judge so that he would have more power. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=164.36s)]
*  There you go. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=168.96s)]
*  The always great Babylon B. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=169.96s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=171.52s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=173.08s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCrTCmnblWc&t=174.08s)]
