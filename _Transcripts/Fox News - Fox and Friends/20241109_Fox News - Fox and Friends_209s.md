# Illegal migrant sounds alarm over rise in crime, gang presence
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c)
*  Mayor Eric Adams told Fox 5 New York, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=0.0s)]
*  as we move towards competitive contracting for asylum seeker programs, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=3.48s)]
*  we've chosen not to renew the emergency contract for this pilot program [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  once the year term concludes. He's talking about the taxpayer-funded [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  prepaid debit cards program for illegal immigrants here in New York City. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=16.44s)]
*  Everything's changed. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=20.48s)]
*  Which angered so many people. They're like, what? They're getting debit cards? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=21.36s)]
*  I saw it for myself. I spoke to migrants outside. We're gonna get to that in a second. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=25.6s)]
*  But I thought this was interesting. The New York Post guys, Trump calling Eric Adams saying [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=29.08s)]
*  he wants to rebuild the city. So a lot of people who were run out of the city, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=33.48s)]
*  who were charged with crimes that were specious here, right down the street here in Manhattan, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=37.76s)]
*  might say, screw that city. But he's like, no, I love this city. And I just want, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=43.839999999999996s)]
*  and I want to help you rebuild New York City. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=48.92s)]
*  For sure. I think when it comes to immigration, and you talked about foreign wars, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=52.0s)]
*  I think you'll see from multiple cabinet secretaries, a renewed focus with our agencies on the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=55.96s)]
*  southern border, right? That the invasion is right here of our homeland, and that needs to be taken [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=60.84s)]
*  care of front and center, for sure. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=64.36s)]
*  And people mad. We were defending borders in Ukraine and not our own, not our own. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=67.80000000000001s)]
*  I, by the way, told you guys a couple weeks ago, I went out and spoke to illegal migrants [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=73.0s)]
*  and got some of their reactions to different things that are happening. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=78.28s)]
*  I asked one of them about Tren de Aragua and what they had been seeing, what he had been seeing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=81.4s)]
*  Listen to this clip, it's fascinating. He's got a lot of advice for America. Listen. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=88.4s)]
*  I've lived with them, but I do have a friend, I know her, and in the hotel where she lives, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=111.36s)]
*  they're living there. And what she tells me is that these people practically take control [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=116.88s)]
*  of those spaces, those places. So that's where I come from, that there has to be government [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=122.68s)]
*  intervention. It's not just a security agent, but there has to be something bigger that controls [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=127.08s)]
*  that. I mean, how are they going to benefit a person who's doing damage, and, in fact, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=132.52s)]
*  wanting to control the whole building? That's not possible. There must be a massive [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=136.2s)]
*  issue, because I think that security is very little for what is really entering this country. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=140.36s)]
*  I wish this clip had gone a little longer. I said to him, is America turning into Venezuela? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=145.8s)]
*  And this guy happens to be of Venezuela. He goes, yep, you guys are turning into Venezuela. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=152.28s)]
*  He also went on to tell me, listen, why aren't you guys vetting people before they enter the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=155.4s)]
*  country? It's too late if you vet them after. This is an illegal immigrant who's saying, why are [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=162.36s)]
*  you giving benefits to gang members who have taken over the hotels that we're staying in? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=167.4s)]
*  This was a fascinating interview of sort of the common sense of those who came across here illegally [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  that our own leaders don't have. And voters agree. I mean, remain in Mexico, coming back, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  building the wall, coming back. A mass deportation, coming to a town near you, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=183.16s)]
*  starting with criminals, starting with gang members. So voters here have, thanks to you, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=187.8s)]
*  the great work that you've done talking about that, I think voters are way more well-informed [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=191.96s)]
*  about the threat of our southern border. Yeah. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=difyVIx9i0c&t=196.44s)]
