# ABC News host suspended for tirade against Trump official
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ)
*  ABC News senior correspondent Terry Moran is now suspended after a while [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=0.0s)]
*  rant against President Trump and one of his top advisors. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=4.8s)]
*  Rich Edson is live at the White House with the details. Rich? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=8.8s)]
*  Hey, good morning Ainsley, Lawrence and Brian. Well, that now deleted late night [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=11.84s)]
*  posts from the weekend from the ABC News correspondent. Terry Moran reads, quote, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  the thing about Stephen Miller is not that he is the brains behind Trumpism. Yes, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=19.2s)]
*  he's one of the people who conceptualizes the impulses of the Trumpist movement and translates [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=22.96s)]
*  them into policy, but that's not what's interesting about Miller. It's not the brains, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=27.52s)]
*  it's bile. Miller is a man who was richly endowed with the capacity for hatred. He's a world-class [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=31.36s)]
*  hater. You can see this just by looking at him because you can see that his hatred are a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=36.88s)]
*  spiritual nourishment. He eats hate. Trump is a world-class hater, but his hatred is only a means [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=42.0s)]
*  to an end, and that end is his own glorification. That is his spiritual nourishment. Officials at [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=46.8s)]
*  the White House are standing behind Miller. This is unacceptable and unhinged rhetoric [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=52.48s)]
*  coming from someone who works at a major television network, but I think this speaks to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  the distrust that the American public have in the legacy media, and it's why in the White House [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  press shop and in President Trump's White House, we have made so many significant and much needed [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  changes to press access and transparency at the White House. Yeah, President Trump is much more [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  accessible than his predecessor, though there have been high-profile fights with media [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=79.84s)]
*  organizations. The Associated Press sued the White House for banning the AP from certain events, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=83.2s)]
*  and the administration's also swapped out major legacy organizations at the Pentagon. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=87.44s)]
*  Back to the Moran story, in a statement, ABC News said, quote, ABC News stands behind, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=91.68s)]
*  stands for objectivity and impartiality in its news coverage and does not condone subjective [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=96.88s)]
*  personal attacks on others. The Post does not reflect the views of ABC News and violates our [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=102.0s)]
*  standards. As a result, Terry Moran has been suspended pending further evaluation. In April, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=106.96s)]
*  Moran interviewed President Trump in the Oval Office. Last year, ABC News controversially [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=112.88s)]
*  settled a lawsuit that President Trump had filed for denformation against the network [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=118.0s)]
*  for $15 million. Back to you. All right. Thanks, Rich. I take you back to that interview when the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=122.63999999999999s)]
*  president did the interview with him. He says, you came into my office and you were so nice. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=128.88s)]
*  And then you start this interview and you start these gotcha questions. Now, this guy releases [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=133.28s)]
*  this strong tweet against the president and a member of his staff with such fury. But there was [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  no fury at all when we lost American citizens every single month for four years because illegals were [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=145.28s)]
*  killing them. There was no passion. There was no fire. I don't know what he was thinking. I don't [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=153.68s)]
*  know what he was thinking about right there. JD Vance posted after this, after Terry Moran's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=157.84s)]
*  post was taken down, he defended the administration. He said, an ABC journalist, Terry Moran, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=162.56s)]
*  posted this absolutely vile smear of Stephen Miller. It's dripping with hatred. Remember that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=168.16s)]
*  every time you watch ABC's coverage of the Trump administration. I mean, that's just so true. For [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=174.24s)]
*  example, he's not a commentator. If you're on the panel on ABC, you know, Reince Priebus, Chris [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=178.8s)]
*  Christie. Yeah, I get it. If you're on ABC, they tend to have more negative Trump people. That's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=184.08s)]
*  commentary. But when you have somebody who goes out there covering stories of immigration and the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=191.04s)]
*  budget, you know they're going to do a story on the big, beautiful bill and make it sound bad. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=196.16s)]
*  You know they're going to talk about what's happening in Los Angeles and make it seem like [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=200.48s)]
*  those National Guard troops are unnecessary. But then you have somebody who, I don't know what he [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=204.32s)]
*  was doing late at night, tweeting. You get the true feelings out. And that's what Trump picks up. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't mind tough questions. He likes tough questions because he's got answers. But he does [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=215.12s)]
*  assumptive questions that have a negative connotation without even acknowledging, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=221.44s)]
*  okay, you don't like what we're doing with ICE. You're going to acknowledge the border sealed? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  For the first time in your lifetime, are you going to acknowledge that the message in Central and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=232.08s)]
*  South America is don't come? Are you going to acknowledge that thousands of Chinese came through [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=236.24s)]
*  and we still don't know where they are or how they got here. So I think that this is so detrimental [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=240.56s)]
*  to ABC. It is. It's worse than Scott Pelley and it's worse than Stephanopoulos because Stephanopoulos, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=246.4s)]
*  everybody knows, ABC, you know he's a press secretary for Clinton. He worked for Bill Clinton, yeah. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=251.04s)]
*  But he's supposed to be the national reporter who's going to approach things evenly. So that, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=254.96s)]
*  along with Scott Pelley, over the weekend sat down and said, I'm urging CBS not to cut a deal [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=261.92s)]
*  with the president. So we say, we're urging CBS, he goes, don't cut a deal with the president, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=268.4s)]
*  and we've seen his rant at Wake Forest. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvo-YcOSqsQ&t=272.47999999999996s)]
