# ICE makes history with largest migrant criminal operation ever
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert. ICE released a new migrant arrest numbers from an operation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=0.0s)]
*  in Massachusetts that they say is their largest nationwide operation ever. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=4.8s)]
*  Operation Patriot ran during the month of May and resulted in the arrest of more than [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  1,400 illegal migrants throughout the state of Massachusetts, 790 of which had previous [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=15.96s)]
*  criminal convictions or charges, while another 277 had final orders of removal and deportation [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=21.98s)]
*  orders. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=28.52s)]
*  We got cooperation from the local police, how much better they could have been. Fox [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=29.52s)]
*  News got to ride along with one of the teams last week, the U.S. Attorney for the District [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=33.08s)]
*  of Massachusetts, set to hold a news conference later today with ICE officials to discuss [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=37.64s)]
*  their results. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=43.24s)]
*  I think the important point is the one that you raised, Brian. You had the locals as well [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=44.24s)]
*  as the state police did not help ICE with this operation, so they had to get more guys [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=50.08s)]
*  and the amount of criminals that they were able to capture on this operation. This is [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=55.0s)]
*  their best operation yet. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=58.84s)]
*  So Bill Mollugian was embedded with them and he was sitting here on the curvy couch on [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  the weekend show. Watch this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=64.92s)]
*  Within like three or four hours, take a look at this graphic right here. These are some [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=68.36s)]
*  of the people they arrested while we were with them. There was a Salvadoran on El Salvador's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=72.14s)]
*  most wanted list with an Interpol red notice out for aggravated murder, kidnapping and robbery. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=78.84s)]
*  You had a convicted child rapist from El Salvador previously deported, living right next to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=83.4s)]
*  a playground, I would add. You had another guy arrested for child sexual assault. He [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=88.28s)]
*  was from Columbia. Massachusetts is kind of like the perfect storm of issues because when [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=93.08s)]
*  people get arrested for these heinous crimes out there, they have such low bail. They just [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  release them and then they don't comply with ICE detainers. So that's what leads to what [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=101.76s)]
*  you're seeing right here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=105.84s)]
*  So that was Bill Mollugian yesterday on the ride along and that's just it. I know the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=108.44s)]
*  president just rotated his new ICE director out. He wants to see the numbers bigger. To [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  me, I'm fine with the numbers because number one, he's stopping new people from coming [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=116.32s)]
*  in. They're all running for cover at this point and we're starting to squeeze it out, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=120.72s)]
*  starting to squeeze these guys down. I'd rather take your time, do the investigation so you [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=125.08s)]
*  don't make any mistakes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=129.32s)]
*  You've got to be surgical and I agree with that, Brian. And I think another aspect of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=130.32s)]
*  this is that there's been a lot of the media talking about how the ICE agents are covering [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=134.8s)]
*  their faces. Well, stop doxing them. Stop sending information and leaking it into activists [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=138.44s)]
*  because these agents didn't sign up for it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=143.0s)]
*  The mayor in San Diego came out and said they're terrorists. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=145.0s)]
*  And speaking of California and Los Angeles, there were 36 Chinese and Taiwanese nationals [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=148.4s)]
*  that were at a nightclub. They were arrested. They are not supposed to be in our country. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=153.76s)]
*  And then also the U.S. Coast Guard, they were able to go in and find the sailboat that was [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=159.0s)]
*  off the coast of California and on board were 16 illegals from Mexico. They caught them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=163.96s)]
*  There was a C-130 Hercules airplane about 54 miles off the coast. They saw the boat. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=171.08s)]
*  Coast Guard went in and arrested them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=177.12s)]
*  Last thing, you just got to think about it. Okay, we know that Biden was allowing these [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=179.28s)]
*  folks just to come into the country. But now we know that all these criminals that were [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  here, they didn't just find out about these criminals being here when Trump took office. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=186.4s)]
*  They knew about it and they just let them sit in all of these communities. You still [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=191.52s)]
*  got the governor that's not giving support. You still got the mayor, Mayor Wu, that's [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=195.12s)]
*  still not supporting the administration. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=198.84s)]
*  And keep in mind, the Mayorkas lied to everybody and said the border was closed. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=200.48s)]
*  The same thing was closed. It was locked. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=204.56s)]
*  It was secure. Secure. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=206.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=208.24s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLgUgsXGLtA&t=208.74s)]
