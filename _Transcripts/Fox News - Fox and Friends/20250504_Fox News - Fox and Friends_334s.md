# Venezuelan opposition leader says Trump’s strategy on this is ‘absolutely correct’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA)
*  Right now Chevron is trying to negotiate with the Trump administration on its license to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=0.0s)]
*  operate in Venezuela. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=7.28s)]
*  Back in February, President Trump dealt a major blow to Venezuela revoking a license [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=9.24s)]
*  to exploit oil here, accusing the dictator Nicolas Maduro of failing to take back violent [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=13.52s)]
*  migrants. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=18.98s)]
*  Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado backed the move and she joins us now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=20.88s)]
*  Maria, it's such an honor to have you on today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=26.32s)]
*  So Chevron chief executive Mike Worth says that their company is trying to negotiate [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=29.2s)]
*  with the Trump administration. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=34.08s)]
*  They want to be able to continue their operations in Venezuela. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=36.84s)]
*  You think this is a very bad idea. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=41.04s)]
*  Explain. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=43.88s)]
*  Well, I believe President Trump's decisions and strategy is absolutely correct and effective [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=44.88s)]
*  and it's already working. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=52.78s)]
*  Remember, we're facing not a simple dictator. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  Maduro is the head of the criminal structure that has turned Venezuela into a safe haven [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=58.72s)]
*  of drug cartels, guerrilla and the enemies of the Western Hemisphere, such as agents [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=64.44s)]
*  of Iran, Russia and other international criminal groups. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=70.92s)]
*  And Maduro is using our resources and the money he gets from illegal illicit activities [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=75.88s)]
*  and oil to promote drug trafficking and to promote migration of Venezuelan citizens, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=83.16s)]
*  destabilizing the region. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=90.6s)]
*  So the right approach is apply law enforcement and it is already working. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=92.28s)]
*  Maduro is in his weaker position ever. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=99.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  Maria, you obviously know that oil is a very powerful interest in our government. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  And as they say, they're trying to get an exception to this licensing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=110.04s)]
*  They want to be able to operate there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=114.32s)]
*  So what would be your message? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=116.32s)]
*  I see your message to Donald Trump is keep doing what you're doing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=117.44s)]
*  Don't let them do this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=120.48s)]
*  Don't give Maduro, who is a criminal and a dictator and basically stole the election, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=121.76s)]
*  these resources to continue his repression of his people. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=127.48s)]
*  What's your message to Chevron and those who want to operate and get oil out of Venezuela? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=131.2s)]
*  Frankly, I think it's absurd. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=137.48s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=141.44s)]
*  What Maduro is allowing right now, it's just prompts to get out of Venezuela. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  But Venezuela is right now the country with the largest proven oil reserves in the world [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=149.88s)]
*  and also in gas. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=158.12s)]
*  So we can turn Venezuela from the criminal hub of the Americas into the energy hub of the Americas. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  But that can only happen with a democratic government. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=167.68s)]
*  Remember, right now we have a government that is taken by drug cartels that has Venezuela [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=173.0s)]
*  in the single lowest place in rule of law in the world. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=178.8s)]
*  So this is a very bad and stupid decision of those that want to support Maduro to use [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=182.72s)]
*  that resources, that money they get from oil for corruption and repression of our people. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=189.64s)]
*  One last question. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=196.16s)]
*  I had representative Jimenez on Fox Noticias this past week. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=196.92s)]
*  He's also pressuring the Trump administration to keep up the economic sanctions and really crack [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=200.32s)]
*  down on people that are doing business with Cuba. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=205.6s)]
*  He believes Cuba is on the verge of toppling. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=207.76s)]
*  We've seen outages. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  They're not able to run their government. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=213.36s)]
*  And he believes that this is a critical juncture. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=215.6s)]
*  Should that happen? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=218.16s)]
*  What is the impact on Venezuela? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=219.36s)]
*  What is the impact on the Western Hemisphere? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=221.12s)]
*  Something Donald Trump has decided to make a big priority. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=223.24s)]
*  Look at this, Rachel. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=228.0s)]
*  Never in history we have the Americas free of communism and dictatorship. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=229.72s)]
*  And we are one step from it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=235.44s)]
*  Once the Maduro regime is out, believe me, Cuba and Nicaragua will follow. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=238.24s)]
*  This is a unique moment in history. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=244.8s)]
*  With the transition in Venezuela, Maduro going out, we will have a continent free of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=248.8s)]
*  communism and dictatorship. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=257.12s)]
*  And we will turn Venezuela into a safe ally for the national security of the United States. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=259.04s)]
*  And we will unleash unprecedented economic opportunities. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=266.24s)]
*  Over one trillion dollars opportunity, not only in oil and gas, but in every sector you [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=270.8s)]
*  can think of. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=277.68s)]
*  So this is the biggest opportunity of our hemispheres in decades to come. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=278.32s)]
*  And we will make it happen. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=283.92s)]
*  Maduro is weaker than ever. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  And we are determined to go till the end. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=287.2s)]
*  Venezuela will be free and we will bring our kids back home. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=290.32s)]
*  Well, it will be interesting if Venezuela could be an ally versus an adversary and a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=295.12s)]
*  menace in our hemisphere. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=298.96s)]
*  You believe the moment is now. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=300.48s)]
*  Maria Carina Machado, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=302.48s)]
*  We really admire you for your courage and determination to set your people free. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=305.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=312.08s)]
*  We will prevail. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjow7qeeDA&t=314.64s)]
