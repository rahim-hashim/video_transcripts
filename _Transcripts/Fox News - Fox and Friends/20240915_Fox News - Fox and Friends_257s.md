# 'True-blue' Democrat leaves party, backs Trump: This was the 'final straw'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk)
*  California Democrat lawmaker revealing she is ditching her party for the Republicans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=0.0s)]
*  and is now backing Donald Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=5.14s)]
*  Gloria Romero admitting, quote, I was a Democratic National Convention delegate for Jesse Jackson [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=7.92s)]
*  and Barack Obama and state co-chair for President Obama's reelection. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=14.16s)]
*  Big time Democrat. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=20.0s)]
*  But I've said goodbye. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=21.0s)]
*  Adios. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=22.32s)]
*  I've had enough. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=23.32s)]
*  This is not the Democratic Party I once championed. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=24.32s)]
*  I don't recognize it anymore. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=26.599999999999998s)]
*  She joins us now with more about her big decision. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=30.2s)]
*  Gloria Romero. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=33.08s)]
*  Gloria, thank you for being here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=34.08s)]
*  It takes a lot of courage to take a stand like this considering what a prominent position [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=35.92s)]
*  you've had inside the Democrat Party in California for a long time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=43.44s)]
*  You chaired this Senate Democratic caucus. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=46.76s)]
*  You were the Senate Majority Leader for three years as a Democrat. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=49.08s)]
*  When did your mind start to say, I need to leave? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=53.44s)]
*  Was it a moment or was it a series of things? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=56.0s)]
*  It's been a series of things. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=58.32s)]
*  I was very disturbed as a former member of the Southern California Executive Board of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=61.16s)]
*  the ACLU. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=65.8s)]
*  I was very disturbed by the lawfare that was being leveled against President Trump. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  I did not like it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=72.52s)]
*  It was wrong. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=73.52s)]
*  I've been very disaffected by the Democratic Party's continued denial of school opportunities [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=74.52s)]
*  for low income children. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=80.12s)]
*  I was throwing out 14 million votes in the Democratic primaries. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  But finally, I think the final straw was when I saw RFK say, you know what, I am leaving [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=88.16s)]
*  the party. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=94.0s)]
*  I am going to support Trump. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=95.0s)]
*  And I said, I'm going to join him and support President Trump as well. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  There's a number of issues, but overall, the party left me. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what it is anymore. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  If this is the new way forward for Democrats, good luck. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  Many of us will be leaving. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=109.56s)]
*  Well, give me your guess of what it is. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=111.28s)]
*  You said it, the party left you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=114.04s)]
*  What is it that has changed the Democrat Party you were once so dedicated to? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=115.92s)]
*  It's just gone complete woke. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=121.72s)]
*  It has abandoned key allies such as Israel, for example. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  I think also as well, it's economic plan. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  A lawn is not a plan. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=130.32s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you grew up middle class or working class. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=132.56s)]
*  It's not a plan overall. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=135.72s)]
*  But I think to me, the Democratic Party has just lurched to the extreme left. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=137.92s)]
*  It's been captured by, you know, many call it the Hamas caucus of the Democratic Party [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=143.48s)]
*  in order to win a swing state. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=148.56s)]
*  The using of what we call the Vedazo in Latin America to basically appoint a successor, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=152.0s)]
*  ignoring the will of the voters. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=158.44s)]
*  There are so many reasons. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=160.6s)]
*  And again, too, as somebody who grew up during Vietnam, seeing the Democratic Party march [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  endlessly towards war, sacrificing American soldiers like those 13 innocent soldiers [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=167.48s)]
*  whose lives and names the VP cannot even acknowledge. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=173.88s)]
*  All of it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=178.24s)]
*  And under Donald Trump and the Republican Party, it really has become, I believe, an [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=179.24s)]
*  agenda for an America that we all want to see for ourselves and our children and our [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=183.8s)]
*  future, keeping us safe, including having a secure border. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=189.0s)]
*  Well said. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=194.12s)]
*  If I may, what has the reaction been? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=195.16s)]
*  Family, former colleagues? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=197.52s)]
*  What's life like right now since you came out supporting Donald Trump and Republicans? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=199.6s)]
*  Well, you know, in politics, you have to have a thick skin, which I do. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=203.88s)]
*  So you get the usual, you know, stuff thrown at you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=206.6s)]
*  But you'd be surprised. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=209.52s)]
*  There have been a number of Democrats who have reached out to me saying, you know, I'm [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=211.08s)]
*  going to leave, too. How did you do it? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  Or I've already left. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  So it's actually been very, very interesting. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=219.76s)]
*  And I intend to try to recruit all of them over to say, let's become part of the new [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=222.6s)]
*  Republican Party under this blue collar billionaire businessman that we want to see [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=227.76s)]
*  protect and lead our families and our country. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=233.68s)]
*  Well, Gloria Romero, I salute you for your courage. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=236.88s)]
*  I hope you'll come back and help explain a lot of these developments. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=240.6s)]
*  We appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=243.32s)]
*  Thank you. Great to see you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIqr1UGMyk&t=244.8s)]
