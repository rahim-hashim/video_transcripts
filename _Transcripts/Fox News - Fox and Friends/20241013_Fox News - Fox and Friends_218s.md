# 'Musk Mania' has overwhelmed the media recently: Turley
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA)
*  We got the endorsement of Elon Musk, you know, that day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=0.0s)]
*  And he said it's, he said it's absolutely imperative we're going to save our country. I have to win. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=8.0s)]
*  He gave me the strongest endorsement. He's a great guy and he makes some great things. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=13.0s)]
*  Donald Trump praising the world's richest man while making his case to swing state voters. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=18.0s)]
*  And a new op-ed, our guest, our next guest writes, Musk's endorsement is causing the far left to, quote, lose their mind. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=23.0s)]
*  Fox News contributor and GW University Law Professor Jonathan Turley joins us now to explain. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=31.0s)]
*  Professor, great to see you. How do you see the reaction to Elon Musk evidencing the left losing their mind? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=36.0s)]
*  Well, it's like another scene out of, you know, the Lord of the Flies. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=45.0s)]
*  You have all these pundits and politicians chasing him around the island and you have people go into absolute vapors every time he talks about a censorship or talks about Donald Trump. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=51.0s)]
*  Really, this turned on Musk when he bought Twitter and took down the censorship system. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=63.0s)]
*  But most importantly, when he released the Twitter files, because many of us were testifying in Congress and Democratic members would say, you've no proof that there's any coordination between the government and these companies. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=69.0s)]
*  And then Elon Musk supplied the proof with thousands of emails coming from government officials and offices, over 80 FBI agents targeting individuals and groups for censorship. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=81.0s)]
*  They never forgave him for that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=95.0s)]
*  And you have this bizarre situation where, you know, you you have CEOs that openly support Harris, openly support extremely far left policies. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=97.0s)]
*  There's not a peep about them, but there is this Musk mania, which has just overwhelmed the media recently. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=107.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I think you and I together could come up with dozens of examples of that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=115.0s)]
*  There's, of course, the extreme lunacy of someone like, you know, former ESPN host Keith Elberman, who said that Musk should be arrested and deported. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=121.0s)]
*  But what I'm curious about is less the lunacy of of someone like that on the left and whether or not you think Musk is risking real retribution some way from the censors and the government officials that he is targeting and highlighting. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=128.0s)]
*  Well, look, they've already done everything they could short of throwing him into a woodchipper. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=144.0s)]
*  I mean, they've targeted his revenue. They've targeted his companies. They've targeted his advertisers. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=150.0s)]
*  In my book, The Indispensable Right, I talk about Musk and love him or hate him. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=156.0s)]
*  He is without question the most consequential figure in free speech of our generation. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=161.0s)]
*  I think that he has done more for free speech than any living person today. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=167.0s)]
*  In some ways, he actually stopped the progress of the anti free speech movement by releasing the Twitter files. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=172.0s)]
*  But he's really that immovable object that this irresistible force encountered. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=180.0s)]
*  And they won't forgive him for it. You know, all the CEOs caved people like Zuckerberg and others. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=187.0s)]
*  They caved like a house of cards. But they finally found someone that couldn't be coerced, couldn't be threatened, couldn't be scared. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=192.0s)]
*  And they will not forgive him for that. Yeah, it's fascinating. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=199.0s)]
*  All right, Jonathan Turley, thanks so much for being with us this morning. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or9Euc7UmrA&t=204.0s)]
