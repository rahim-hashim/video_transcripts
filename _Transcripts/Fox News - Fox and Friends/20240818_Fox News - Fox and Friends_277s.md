# ‘HISTORIC’: Biden set to pass the torch to Harris at DNC
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k)
*  So the DNC kicks off tomorrow in Chicago with President Joe Biden said to give the keynote [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=0.0s)]
*  address Monday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=8.0s)]
*  He's expected to officially pass the torch to his vice president, doubting his administration's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=10.08s)]
*  accomplishments, while warning of the so-called threat Donald Trump poses if he returns to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  the White House. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=19.04s)]
*  Joining us now is the former DNC Deputy Press Secretary Jose Aristimano. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=20.04s)]
*  Jose, great to see you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=24.16s)]
*  Your thoughts, because we've never seen anything quite like this over the last 25 days. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=26.28s)]
*  The Democrats have changed leaders. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=30.740000000000002s)]
*  What do you think is going to be the biggest challenge? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=33.08s)]
*  Look, it's going to be historic. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=35.2s)]
*  I think first and foremost, we know Kamala Harris, she's been vice president. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  There's no other Democrats, we don't know who she is. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=42.04s)]
*  I think now she's center stage. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  We ought to remember she's been campaigning for less than 30 days. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  So it is historic. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=49.72s)]
*  But I think that the pace that she's been able to pick up this campaign in terms of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=51.72s)]
*  money, in terms of traveling the country, in picking Tim Walz. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=55.64s)]
*  I think the biggest challenge will be introducing Tim Walz as a vice presidential candidate. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  But I don't think that's that big of a challenge. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=63.2s)]
*  I think this campaign is new, is fresh, is energetic. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=65.2s)]
*  We see it in the polls. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=70.56s)]
*  I think people are very, very excited to see what's going to unfold in Chicago this coming [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=71.72s)]
*  week. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=76.4s)]
*  So just looking at what the people care about of Democrats and Republicans, 38 percent say [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=77.4s)]
*  economy is number one, 14 percent almost half immigration, and number three, abortion. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=82.24s)]
*  Abortion clearly in the Democrats' column. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  Immigration is not in almost every poll and neither is the economy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=91.16s)]
*  So having said that, Friday we found out her vision for the economy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=94.2s)]
*  That's the only thing we found out. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=98.96s)]
*  If not, we just go by what her administration has done for the last three and a half years. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=101.28s)]
*  Where does the cleaver start between Harris and Biden? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=106.92s)]
*  What I'll do as opposed to what I did. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=111.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, it's a great question. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=113.24s)]
*  I think people should judge Kamala Harris and the Biden-Harris administration on the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=116.36s)]
*  results. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  Inflation was nine percent a little over a year ago. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  It's now 3.5 percent. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=126.68s)]
*  We look at job creation. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=128.28s)]
*  We've been creating jobs steadily for a couple of years now. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=129.72s)]
*  So things are looking up. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=133.0s)]
*  Now Kamala Harris, she recognizes, she said, look, things are too expensive still. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=134.0s)]
*  We got to continue to bring gas prices down. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=137.72s)]
*  The housing costs. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  She just did an incentive. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  She revealed an incentive yesterday to build three million homes, incentives for new constructions, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  incentives for homeowners, down payment incentives. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=147.72s)]
*  So she's saying, she's telling people, detail economic plans. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=150.84s)]
*  I would argue a lot more detail than Donald Trump has been doing in the last couple of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=154.64s)]
*  months. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  So I think, again, I think the energy that we've seen from Kamala, the details of the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  proposals that we saw yesterday, I think that's what the American people are going to do. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=165.64s)]
*  Let me just say something quickly. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=169.6s)]
*  They did a digital donation campaign, Republicans for Heritage. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=170.6s)]
*  Over 70,000 people are connected on that live Zoom. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=175.84s)]
*  So that tells you something. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=180.6s)]
*  I think there is a gap and there's a couple of a bunch of Republicans within the party, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=181.68s)]
*  within the Republican Party that say, I don't want another chairman of Donald Trump. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=186.48s)]
*  Jose, the one thing that sticks out, she does do to her policy when it comes to the economy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  The housing was looked at more positively, but with the price controls and everything [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=197.24s)]
*  else, I look at with the Washington Post basically not impressed. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=200.24s)]
*  The Times demand a serious economic ideas. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  Harris supplies gimmicks. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=207.72s)]
*  That's the Washington Post. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=209.44s)]
*  So that's when she's going to, you're going to find out what she's made out of. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  When she says what she will do, how it differs from what Joe Biden did and how she's going [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=213.84s)]
*  to be able to defend it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  Because as a candidate, her policies seem to be an epic fail and she seems to be reversing [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=220.58s)]
*  yourselves in almost every one of them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=226.44s)]
*  Correct? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=228.48s)]
*  Well, I would argue that Paul say otherwise. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=229.48s)]
*  Look at every swing state in America. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  The Kamala Harris campaign is up by one, two or three points. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=235.68s)]
*  Some of them well under the margin of error. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=240.24s)]
*  So I think I'm not a huge believer in Paul's. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  We had to remember in 2016, Hillary Clinton was winning every single poll in America and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=243.84s)]
*  we lost the elections. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=248.04s)]
*  I wouldn't tell people just look at Paul's and tell you a picture in time, but we got [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=249.04s)]
*  to go out and vote. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=254.0s)]
*  So I think that's the point game is what's going to make a difference in election day. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=255.0s)]
*  They certainly have a lot of star power if they want to use it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=258.72s)]
*  Hollywood's all going to be there in great numbers. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=260.96s)]
*  Jose, thanks so much. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=262.88s)]
*  Look forward to this going to be an interesting week. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=264.44s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyvBSwFW4k&t=266.24s)]
