**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw)
*  Israeli military detaining the director of she of shefa hospital in the Gaza strip as they say they have evidence [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=0.0s)]
*  Showing the hospital served as Hamas as Hamas's command center [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  Yeah within the last hour smoke has been rising over the Israel Gaza border as the temporary ceasefire and hostage release that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=12.56s)]
*  Were originally set for this morning are delayed. So our friend Trey Yanks has been on the ground in southern Israel. He's there right now [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=20.16s)]
*  He's gonna give us some info about the updated timeline Trey. What do you know? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=27.48s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys first of all, happy Thanksgiving here on the ground in southern Israel [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=33.6s)]
*  Anticipation is growing around that expected hostage deal that could see more than 50 Israelis [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=38.44s)]
*  Released by Hamas inside the Gaza strip in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=44.84s)]
*  Though there appears to be a holdup right now early reports indicate [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=51.96s)]
*  There is a disagreement between Israel and Hamas over one of the terms [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=55.76s)]
*  Remember we were looking at a large-scale ceasefire for four days along with this swap of hostages for prisoners [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=60.04s)]
*  But there were a number of other agenda items on this agreement [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=66.12s)]
*  One of them had to do with access to the other hostages inside the Gaza strip [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=69.28s)]
*  The Israelis wanted to be able to get more information about those hostages and make sure they were checked on by the Red Cross [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=73.66s)]
*  It appears Hamas is sort of stepping back from this line item and it is something that is causing tension and might be behind [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=80.72s)]
*  The delay that we are seeing right now [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  It comes as the Israelis are saying they will continue the fight against Hamas until all of the group's leadership is destroyed [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=88.96s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying yesterday quote I want to be clear the war is continuing the war is continuing [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=96.16s)]
*  We will continue it until we achieve all of our goals their goals to get those hostages back and to destroy and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=102.88s)]
*  Delegitimize Hamas inside Gaza so many families waiting today for any information to see if their loved ones will be on the list of those [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=110.64s)]
*  Hostages released if the deal does move forward right now [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=118.24s)]
*  We are just talking about women and children, but the whole world is watching just yesterday [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=121.38s)]
*  The National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said this about the situation [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=126.18s)]
*  We're obviously going to be watching this like a hawk the devil's in the details and the execution and so we're going to be watching [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=131.88s)]
*  To see that all sides meet their commitments and we know we recognize [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=138.72s)]
*  That that one party to this agreement is a terrorist organization a terrorist organization that hasn't always [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  Abided by the commitments that they have made [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=150.67999999999998s)]
*  It's an organization that is fighting among the civilian population inside Gaza [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=155.0s)]
*  We are learning at this hour the Saja neighborhood in the northern part of the Gaza Strip has just faced an evacuation order the Israelis [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOhERf7jGQw&t=160.07999999999998s)]
