# 'I'm just floored!': Hosts react to Hunter Biden pardon
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc)
*  You're not gonna believe it, we thought we had the show set and then this happened last [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=0.0s)]
*  night. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=5.3s)]
*  Fox News alert, President Biden's pardoning his son, Hunter Wright, excusing any offenses [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=6.3s)]
*  the first son may have committed over the past decade. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=11.38s)]
*  Madeline Rivera is at the White House with the latest for us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  Hey, Madeline. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=17.26s)]
*  Hi, guys. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=18.26s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=19.26s)]
*  Well, this is a big 180 for a president who has long said he will follow the rule of law, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=20.26s)]
*  but the president says he changed his mind because he believes Hunter's charges were [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=23.22s)]
*  meant to break him politically. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=27.02s)]
*  In a statement, the president says, in part, here's the truth. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=28.64s)]
*  I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=35.08s)]
*  Hunter was supposed to have sentencing hearings on December 12th for his gun case and December [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  16th for his tax case. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=44.44s)]
*  All of those now gone. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=46.84s)]
*  But the president's pardon doesn't just cover these offenses. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  It covers any crime the first son may have committed between January 2014 to December [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=51.08s)]
*  2024. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=55.660000000000004s)]
*  And that time frame is notable given that Hunter joined the board of Burisma Holdings [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=56.660000000000004s)]
*  in 2014 and he has been scrutinized for his foreign business dealings. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=61.42s)]
*  The president says he made this decision over the weekend while spending Thanksgiving holiday [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=66.14s)]
*  with his family. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=70.06s)]
*  But NBC, which was the first to report this news, says the president had been talking [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=71.66s)]
*  about the possibility of pardoning Hunter with his close aides as far back as June when [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  Hunter was convicted on those gun charges. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=80.56s)]
*  As for whether we'll get any on-camera comments from the White House on this, there is no [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  press briefing for the next few days with the president abroad for his long-awaited [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=87.24s)]
*  trip to Angola. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=91.28s)]
*  Corrine Jean-Pierre and National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby will gaggle [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=92.88s)]
*  on board Air Force One today, still that is off-camera. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=97.83999999999999s)]
*  And remember, the president held no news conferences when he had those international summits last [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  month in Peru and Brazil. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=105.72s)]
*  Lawrence, Steve, Ryan and Ainsley, rather. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=108.32s)]
*  Alright, Madeline, thank you very much. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=110.6s)]
*  You got it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=112.72s)]
*  I mean, I'm not surprised you're not surprised by the cold weather. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=113.74s)]
*  I mean, she does the same in 60 as she does in 30. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=114.74s)]
*  And she ran to the White House. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=117.42s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=119.1s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=120.1s)]
*  So, we knew this was going to happen, but we just couldn't believe the audacious way [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=121.1s)]
*  it did happen. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=125.06s)]
*  Number one, I think it took almost zero courage. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=126.26s)]
*  You do it on a Sunday and then go to Angola and then take your press secretary with you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=129.82s)]
*  So no press conferences, just let the chips fall over the May. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=134.9s)]
*  Pardoning your son to me is not shocking. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=139.26s)]
*  Roger Clinton getting reported by Bill Clinton, not shocking. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=141.32000000000002s)]
*  But never admitting that you were going to do it, saying definitively you wouldn't do [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=144.84s)]
*  it and then going ahead and doing it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=149.8s)]
*  And then the letter that followed to explain what went into it is just full of holes and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  inconsistencies that I think will even wide open and leave his party susceptible to further [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=157.74s)]
*  damage. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=163.72000000000003s)]
*  And Brian, in that letter, he said, quote, I have followed a simple principle. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=164.72000000000003s)]
*  Just tell the American people the truth. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=167.56s)]
*  No, you lied to us. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=169.4s)]
*  So many times, but about this specifically. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=171.10000000000002s)]
*  You said you were not going to pardon your son. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=173.74s)]
*  You said it over and over and over. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=175.78s)]
*  You said you didn't know anything about your son's, his businesses. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=177.26000000000002s)]
*  You never discuss it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=180.62s)]
*  Then there's video or pictures of you playing golf with his business associates. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=181.62s)]
*  You said you didn't know anything about your brother with Burisma. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  But he lied about this and I think he was always going to pardon. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=188.78s)]
*  He just lied because he was running for president and he didn't want that to hurt him and affect [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=192.58s)]
*  the election. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=196.22000000000003s)]
*  But he said he decided over the weekend. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=197.22000000000003s)]
*  So what's your wrong with it? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=198.22000000000003s)]
*  But listen to this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=199.22000000000003s)]
*  I think that he thought about it and he knew he was going to do this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=200.24s)]
*  The sentencing for Hunter is in a few days, December 12th. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=203.12s)]
*  The sentencing for the California case is on December 16th. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=206.2s)]
*  So you have the Delaware case and California case within the next few days. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  So I think he said, I've got to do this now. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=213.84s)]
*  And he pardoned him for 10 years. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=216.6s)]
*  January 1st, 2014. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=218.44s)]
*  Four months later, he started working for Burisma. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=220.76s)]
*  So speaking of lies, the Daily Signal puts it this way, talking about some of the lies [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=223.44s)]
*  that have been said from the White House podium. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=228.06s)]
*  It's transitory inflation. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=230.85999999999999s)]
*  Afghanistan was a success. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=232.42s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=234.5s)]
*  Robert Herr lied. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=235.5s)]
*  Biden's fine. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=236.5s)]
*  Those videos are cheap fakes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=237.82s)]
*  Biden had jet lag. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  Biden had a cold. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=240.89999999999998s)]
*  Biden isn't going to be replaced. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=241.89999999999998s)]
*  Biden isn't going to pardon Hunter. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  The great thing about this is that now it seems like the president of the United States [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=246.04s)]
*  agrees with Donald Trump that there's corruption within the FBI and the Department of Justice. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=250.18s)]
*  He said the exact opposite. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=254.1s)]
*  So maybe we can get something done about it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=255.1s)]
*  And finally, they have we're all on the same page now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=257.54s)]
*  So maybe we can get a new regime in to change this corruption that he's. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=261.36s)]
*  Well, you know, and Brian, you brought up the fact that on the way out, Bill Clinton [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  pardoned his half brother, Roger, for cocaine. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=269.56s)]
*  On the way out, Donald Trump pardoned his son-in-law, Jared's father, Charles. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  But what's unique about this case is both of those people had served time already. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=280.0s)]
*  They'd already done their jail time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=285.32s)]
*  This is to avoid jail time because he has not been sentenced yet. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=288.09999999999997s)]
*  And so this is just essentially a gigantic get out of jail free card. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=292.21999999999997s)]
*  Axios says they've got to break down why Joe Biden did this now. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=297.62s)]
*  And what it says is for years this break. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=302.36s)]
*  This actually kind of makes sense. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=305.4s)]
*  For years, Joe Biden has felt guilty because he became president and brought scrutiny upon [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=307.32s)]
*  Hunter Biden. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=314.82s)]
*  And there were investigations and all that stuff. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=315.82s)]
*  And so Biden and Biden's family believe that the attacks on Hunter ultimately were meant [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=318.14s)]
*  to push him into relapse and imperil Joe. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=324.7s)]
*  You've got to be a kid. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=328.38s)]
*  He had more opportunities than most kids ever do. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=331.38s)]
*  I am simply explaining their rationale for doing it at this time. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=334.42s)]
*  So in other words, Joe Biden felt bad that his presidency caused Hunter Biden to get [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=339.02s)]
*  investigated. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=345.02s)]
*  But is Axios saying that's their theory or are they saying that's the Biden theory? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=346.02s)]
*  That's what I said. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=350.14s)]
*  So Joe Biden and the family feel that Hunter, they believe that he was attacked. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=351.14s)]
*  They were attacking Hunter to push him into relapse and imperil Joe's presence. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=358.46s)]
*  Everybody from all different sides, there's such nonsense when you have people from all [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=364.21999999999997s)]
*  different backgrounds that have had people that had disabilities when it comes to the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=368.38s)]
*  drug addiction. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=373.74s)]
*  No one's even talking about that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=374.74s)]
*  People are talking about the corruption. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=376.74s)]
*  And explain that to all the men that you put behind bars when you signed the crime bill [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=379.06s)]
*  and now you want sympathy for your son. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  You had no problem locking up all these other men back in the day after you authored a bill. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=386.82s)]
*  So spare me with the, oh, this is because pushing him into relapse. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=391.34000000000003s)]
*  No one even is talking about it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=396.54s)]
*  And along the way to finding his international business deal, we found hookers and crack. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=398.54s)]
*  But only thing people care about. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=403.18s)]
*  And he put that out. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=405.38s)]
*  Is the Romanian billionaire, the Ukrainian barisma deal, the Moscow mayor's wife, the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=406.38s)]
*  millions coming out of China and the diamond ring. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=414.62s)]
*  Those are the things that happened. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=417.1s)]
*  By the way, this is the most luxurious crack addiction ever. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=418.1s)]
*  With crack, usually your life goes down. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=423.02s)]
*  The more crack he did, his life went up and millions came spiraling in. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=425.3s)]
*  The fact is he didn't pay taxes on it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=428.5s)]
*  Was an additional red flag. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=430.74s)]
*  Well, you know what, Brian, what you just detailed, those are things we know of. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=432.34000000000003s)]
*  Essentially this pardon, this unconditional pardon excuses him from anything he did. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=437.22s)]
*  And that includes the stuff we know about and the stuff we don't know about ultimately. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=444.26s)]
*  Earlier it was brought up that Joe has put his entire political party, the Democrats, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=449.62s)]
*  in a pickle. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=456.18s)]
*  Think about the Democrats. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=457.46s)]
*  What did they do to Joe Biden? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=459.26s)]
*  They got rid of him, run him for president, and now I don't think he cares. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=461.02s)]
*  It is revenge, absolutely. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=465.94s)]
*  I think he was going to do it regardless. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=469.06s)]
*  They just lied about it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=471.86s)]
*  Whether he became president or not, the son was not going to serve one day in jail, which [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=473.22s)]
*  is why the media should have been akin to what was going to happen. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=479.9s)]
*  They asked the question so I'd give them some credit for that, but they said he's an honest [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=485.5s)]
*  guy. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=488.86s)]
*  This is a guy that would never do this. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=489.86s)]
*  By the way, the White House sold us two stories. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=491.5s)]
*  They said that Hunter Biden was a successful businessman and also that he was an addict [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=494.32s)]
*  as well. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=499.46s)]
*  The smartest man in the room that was also severely addicted to drink, you cannot have [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=500.62s)]
*  it both ways. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=505.78s)]
*  Either he was a successful businessman that had all these connections or he was addicted. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=506.78s)]
*  Can't be both. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=513.02s)]
*  I think also he thinks that as a dad maybe he's afraid to lose another son and that's [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=514.18s)]
*  why he wants to take care of this son. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=519.38s)]
*  That's more important to him than watching his son have consequences for breaking the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=521.46s)]
*  law. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=527.14s)]
*  Also, I'm just floored at the just lie. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=528.14s)]
*  I'm floored that he told us over and over, I am not going to pardon him. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=535.9s)]
*  So I thought, wait a minute, he's definitely going to let his son go to prison. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=539.38s)]
*  So maybe he's assuming that Kamala will win, maybe they have a deal, Kamala will pardon [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=545.38s)]
*  him in January. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=549.9399999999999s)]
*  That way he can continue to say, I'm not going to pardon, I'm not going to pardon. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=550.9399999999999s)]
*  But then you look at the sentencing. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=554.56s)]
*  The sentencing is in a few days for Delaware and for California. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=556.42s)]
*  Just a coincidence. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=560.66s)]
*  It's right before that is when he decides to pardon. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=561.66s)]
*  It's just a coincidence, Ainsley. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=563.9s)]
*  He was thinking about it over the weekend. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=565.3399999999999s)]
*  Over the weekend. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=566.3399999999999s)]
*  You know what? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=567.3399999999999s)]
*  You know what? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=568.3399999999999s)]
*  I can't have any more cranberry sauce. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=569.3399999999999s)]
*  Either way, give me the paperwork. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=570.78s)]
*  I'm going to pardon Hunter. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=572.42s)]
*  You might as well tell him. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=574.06s)]
*  Well, we knew it was coming because just before the pardon, Hunter Biden's attorneys put out [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=575.06s)]
*  a 52 page paper called the Political Prosecutions of Hunter Biden. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=580.42s)]
*  So it's like, OK, that pops out. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=585.28s)]
*  Maxino, his dad says, I'm guilt, I feel guilty about Hunter getting dragged through the muck. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=587.0799999999999s)]
*  And so I've done this. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=593.48s)]
*  It's only political when it comes to Hunter Biden. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=595.12s)]
*  Who knew that they were above approach with everything else? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=597.56s)]
*  But when it comes to Hunter Biden, then suddenly they become political. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=601.68s)]
*  Well, when President Trump tries to pardon the J-6ers, I think they're going to have [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=604.52s)]
*  a lot less pushback. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=608.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=609.28s)]
*  He's going to say, you know what? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=610.28s)]
*  I looked at it, they suffered enough. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=611.5s)]
*  They actually went to jail. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  Brian, it's not of if he wants to. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=614.6s)]
*  He's definitely going to do it now. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=618.0s)]
*  He has all the political cover to do it right now. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=619.2s)]
*  After this, no time. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=622.8000000000001s)]
*  And these people have already served some time. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=624.48s)]
*  You got a praying grandmother that was praying outside of the Capitol or right inside of [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=626.2800000000001s)]
*  the Capitol. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=630.1600000000001s)]
*  And she's doing 10 years, I think. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=631.1600000000001s)]
*  So I mean, you can see the pardons coming. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=634.1s)]
*  Yeah, this is great. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=636.5600000000001s)]
*  We have so much. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=637.5600000000001s)]
*  We have so much on this show. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  Listen, Hunter had every opportunity under the sun. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=639.5600000000001s)]
*  I read his ex-wife's book, Kathleen's book, and wow, I know it's just her side of the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=642.12s)]
*  story, but what he put his family through and his children through and his ex-wife through [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=649.4s)]
*  is unbelievable. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=653.92s)]
*  And we saw that at the trial and it was hugely embarrassing to all the Bidens. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=654.92s)]
*  And this essentially puts that all to rest. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=658.64s)]
*  Or does it? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=662.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=663.1s)]
*  I would say this. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=664.1s)]
*  One of the reasons Michelle Obama is not really tight with the Bidens is because they were [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=665.1s)]
*  tight with Bo's family and his wife. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=668.88s)]
*  And they saw the way they just kicked her to the curb. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=672.24s)]
*  She's probably out there with London's daughter. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=675.32s)]
*  What's the daughter's name? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=678.24s)]
*  Navy. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XroGxpzasc&t=679.24s)]
