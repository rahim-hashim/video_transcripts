# Outlining Trump's ‘fair deal’ for US and China
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc)
*  Meanwhile, President Trump is trying to do big things here in America, trying to reach [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=0.0s)]
*  a trade deal with China after having already reached a trade deal with the United Kingdom. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=7.46s)]
*  President Trump talking earlier about Besant, the Treasury Secretary meeting with Chinese [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=14.14s)]
*  officials in Switzerland. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=23.76s)]
*  What parameters have you given Scott Besant on negotiating with China this weekend? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=26.76s)]
*  We have to make a great deal for America. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=30.76s)]
*  Are you going to be disappointed if he comes back without a deal? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  No, not at all, because we already made a great deal. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  We're not doing business with China right now. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Given your relationship with China... [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  We lost one trillion dollars last year with China, one trillion. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  So if you're not going to do business with them, you're not going to lose one trillion dollars. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  I think we're going to come back with a fair deal for both China and us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=54.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you see all of this play out. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=58.76s)]
*  Last night I saw Howard Lutnick on Laura Ingraham's show saying he thought he had this amazing deal [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=61.76s)]
*  and he gives it to the president. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  The president is like, I think I can do a little better, picks up the phone and it gets a billion dollars better. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  That's the kind of stuff. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  And you talk with the small business owners who also are reacting in a positive way to what Donald Trump's doing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  Despite the fact that it may have some short-term hardships for them, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=80.76s)]
*  I think what it is is we have the best negotiator in the world negotiating on our behalf, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=86.76s)]
*  recognizing the way we've been ripped off and the elites let it happen, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=91.76s)]
*  probably because a lot of them were on the take in this selling off of our country and our workers and our industry. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=96.76s)]
*  And Donald Trump saying, no, we're not doing it like that anymore. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=102.76s)]
*  And I think this is the difference that it makes having a businessman in that very powerful position. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=106.76s)]
*  Well, it is interesting because as small business people, one thing you understand really well is negotiation. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=112.76s)]
*  You understand how you walk into that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=118.76s)]
*  You understand how the table lays out. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=120.76s)]
*  And so when you think about who has patience for what the president's doing right now, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=122.76s)]
*  I actually think it's business owners in America because they get the process here. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=125.76s)]
*  They don't they don't want to see him reveal his cards right before Scott Besson walks into that negotiation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=130.76s)]
*  And one of the big things on the table amidst all of this, of course, is the issue of rare earth minerals, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=136.76s)]
*  because they're so important in so many modern technologies. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=143.76s)]
*  We talked about that with Graceland Baskin in last hour. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=146.76s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=148.76s)]
*  So when we look at the heavy rare earth that China has recently exported control of, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=150.76s)]
*  China actually processes close to 100 percent of them. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=155.76s)]
*  They don't have 100 percent of them, but they source their own heavy rare earth as well as rare earth from other parts of the world. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=159.76s)]
*  Bring them back home for that midstream processing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=166.76s)]
*  The difficulty is while the U.S. is building our separation capabilities, we're not done yet. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=169.76s)]
*  So we are wholly reliant on China at present. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=176.76s)]
*  You know, rare earth minerals is an important topic, obviously really important to so much of the technology that we have and will have moving forward. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=179.76s)]
*  I'm going to suggest this to you guys. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=187.76s)]
*  The main reason we need to take over rare earth minerals and do it ourselves is that we do it humanely. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=189.76s)]
*  China and other countries are behind mines in Africa that are using child slave labor. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=195.76s)]
*  If you've seen the photos, you can Google it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=202.76s)]
*  It is one of the most heartbreaking things you have ever seen. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=204.76s)]
*  They have no morals when it comes to rare earth mineral extraction. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=208.76s)]
*  And they don't care if they use little children as young as seven, six years old, working 12 hours a day in these terrible conditions. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=212.76s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=220.76s)]
*  So for that alone, we should get involved. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=222.76s)]
*  It's a little bit like turning to China for clean energy, windmills, plastic solar panels that are made. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=225.76s)]
*  You're like, have you seen how they do this? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=233.76s)]
*  It's all great. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=235.76s)]
*  So it's all great. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=236.76s)]
*  When they talk about people allow that to happen, profiting. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=237.76s)]
*  You talk about clean energy. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=239.76s)]
*  All the dirty parts of that are hidden away from what the consumer sees. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=240.76s)]
*  But you've got to believe they're there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=245.76s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=246.76s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6IWBREjEc&t=247.76s)]
