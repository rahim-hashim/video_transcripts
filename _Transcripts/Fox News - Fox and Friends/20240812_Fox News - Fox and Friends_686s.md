# Obama secretly running Kamala's campaign, says former speaker
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc)
*  That has to be hard though if you're working for Joe Biden and you think he's going to be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=0.0s)]
*  the candidate right and you're an aide working on his staff or his campaign and then all of a sudden [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  things change and they push up Kamala Harris right what happens to you especially because they have [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=9.52s)]
*  tensions between the staff exactly because he she couldn't keep anybody 87 percent of those staffers [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=14.16s)]
*  have resigned from day one and then you have the Biden people who think you know I don't even know [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=19.12s)]
*  how to work with her and they don't work with her and now all of a sudden they get elevated and they [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=23.04s)]
*  used to disparage her right and General Malley for example General Malley Dillon the former [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=28.0s)]
*  white uh former Biden White House official talked to her over the weekend said I need to know my [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=33.36s)]
*  role right they're all nervous about David Plouffe coming in from the Obama years well they should [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=38.64s)]
*  be nervous because he he's great at his job also you got Stephanie Cutter as well so David Plouffe [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=42.88s)]
*  apparently is is is in control of the math how did he get to 270 great at his job Stephanie Cutter [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=48.0s)]
*  is now over messaging all the communication strategy the one thing I find troubling though [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=54.0s)]
*  okay you got David Plouffe and Stephanie Cutter had a great candidate they had Barack Obama [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=59.6s)]
*  someone that was on this is a plan that was five years in the making to get him to the presidency [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=63.44s)]
*  now they have Kamala Harris who they can't put on the road to actually talk to voters on a day-to-day [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=70.0s)]
*  basis sure they can keep her on the prompter but she's not going to have any of those breakout [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=74.72s)]
*  moments now apparently the tension is is because they said that David Plouffe is over the math [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=79.84s)]
*  but he's really running the campaign right and Jen O'Malley Dillon wants her role to be [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=84.72s)]
*  solidified as the campaign manager because when you think about it uh the the Biden team which [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=90.48s)]
*  a lot of it has morphed into the Harris team uh with the reelection in Wilmington and why is it [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  in Wilmington now because she's not from Wilmington um you know they're the people who thought that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  in the run-up to the election they would put Joe Biden at union halls with 80 people right suddenly [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=107.36s)]
*  they've got big events where there are in you know in excess of 10 000 people and it's completely [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  different and one of the other things according to this Politico article that talks a little bit [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=118.32s)]
*  about the tension between the Harris team and the campaign is the fact that apparently there are some [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=122.56s)]
*  people on the uh on one of the teams that is bad mouth uh the the current vice president who's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=129.28s)]
*  running for president and they don't like that person right i mean you can see they're a big [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=136.64s)]
*  part of the team here's the headline of the Politico article Kamala Harris united democrats [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=140.55999999999997s)]
*  her campaign still has fractures it talks about how Biden Biden's aides as you're saying Steve [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=144.32s)]
*  in the past have known for their disparaging comments about Kamala Harris it talks about [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  the daunting task to try to integrate two different political worlds it talks about [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=155.11999999999998s)]
*  David Plouffe coming in and Kevin McCarthy was interviewed and he said because David Plouffe [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=159.76s)]
*  worked for Obama helped get him elected he said Obama's really running the show here listen [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=165.84s)]
*  watching the campaign now some of Obama's David Plouffe and others are now working on the campaign [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=171.68s)]
*  you're getting the Obamas shifting from running the White House to now running this campaign [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=178.4s)]
*  this is the most liberal ticket in the history of American politics we do not want to put San [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=183.84s)]
*  Francisco in the Minnesota across this country and and Nancy Pelosi may have taken Joe Biden out [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=190.4s)]
*  but remember who was the speaker of the house during President Barack Obama's uh presidency [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  was Nancy Pelosi very extremely close apparently some of the reporting that we saw during the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=202.0s)]
*  Sundays and show is that they did not President Obama Nancy Pelosi as well as some of the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  leadership did not anticipating uh anticipate Joe Biden selecting Kamala to be the candidate they [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=210.8s)]
*  were expecting an open primary process and after that second statement he named him put them all in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=218.32s)]
*  the top so I think he's saying to Nancy Pelosi there's two people with a lot of experience [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=223.68s)]
*  number one I know you ousted me but I'm going to pick who's next I know you don't like her [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  because we saw you on television on CNN when asked should you be the running mate for Joe Biden goes [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=231.68s)]
*  he thinks so remember yeah he thinks so and how about this imagine if you're Julie Chavez Rodriguez [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=236.56s)]
*  and you're running Joe Biden's campaign which got a big elevation right and all of a sudden you find [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=242.72s)]
*  out now you're in charge of the Sun Belt states really I thought I was leading yeah yeah I thought [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  I was the one getting to 270 now David Plouffe comes off the bench uh leaves Kellyanne Conway's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=253.76s)]
*  podcast right and now runs things so I hope they work it out because she has a history of not being [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=259.44s)]
*  able to work out anything with her staff remember a terrible campaign staff a terrible vice presidential [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=264.64s)]
*  staff who I'm not saying they're bad individually but collectively there was no leadership and they [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  end up tearing each other's eyes out I think they're doing whatever it takes whatever it takes [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=274.64s)]
*  to win they we have 30 plus 35 days until early voting is that right 34 days tick tick tick well [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=278.32s)]
*  I just hope I just hope the Republicans take the same strategy and do whatever it takes to win all [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=285.84s)]
*  the petty uh going back and forth with old opponents George and all that matters right it's about who's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=292.32s)]
*  gonna win and Kamala Harris what does this tell you this tells you that she needs all the help she [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=299.44s)]
*  can get Donald Trump's running his own show but they can't trust Kamala Harris to run her own show [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=304.24s)]
*  they have to tell her what to do and bring in Obama's people yeah to your point uh one of the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=309.04s)]
*  things the Republicans need to do is they need a a solid ground game the Democrats for decades have [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=313.36s)]
*  had a great get out the vote on election day right exactly well even before that uh going back decades [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=319.6s)]
*  they were really good machine politics the Republicans right now don't have that they're [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=326.96s)]
*  kind of farming it out to other people but behind the scenes also part of a political playbook it's [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=332.08s)]
*  interesting apparently she is Kamala Harris is getting ready to debate uh Donald Trump you know [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=337.76s)]
*  who the debate partner is that they have selected it is Hillary Clinton's former aide that Philippe [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  Reynes is the guy who's going to actually be playing Donald Trump yeah exactly well well and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=349.67999999999995s)]
*  one of the things they will be doing is they will be trying to get her to pivot and she's been [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=355.04s)]
*  pivoting on a lot of stuff flip-flopping uh flip-flopping another polite way to put it in politics [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=361.04s)]
*  changing her mind totally here just like Biden did on day one remember all those executive orders [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=366.48s)]
*  shutting down the wall shutting down the pipeline but he did tell us he was gonna do moderate though [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=371.92s)]
*  yeah he told us he was gonna be moderate last week we talked about how she was using uh the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=376.56s)]
*  big airplane at big events a la Donald Trump and now she's taken something that is very near and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=380.96s)]
*  dear to people who live on tips watch the comparison seem familiar raise the minimum wage [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=387.12s)]
*  and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers when i get to office we [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=397.28s)]
*  are going to not charge taxes on tips there will be no taxes on tips no taxes on tips it's called [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=403.92s)]
*  no tax on tips no tax on tips i'm also doing no tax on tips no tax on tips so the question is [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=414.24s)]
*  does she even know what the policy is when it comes to no tax on tips where does she where did [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=425.68s)]
*  it come from the teleprompter who who who does it all encompass in it also if you remember it's [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=430.64s)]
*  not just the tips policy the democrats joe biden and kamala harris have already said they want to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=436.4s)]
*  roll back the trump uh tax cuts that are set to expire what's your position on that are you gonna [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=441.44s)]
*  be in support of a tax increase on most of americans that got a tax cut under that bill [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  i mean there's been no pushback or curiosity why now why now he's been in office for three and a [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=453.2s)]
*  half years as the vice president or why not do it now as the vice president you have some influence [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=458.88s)]
*  you can apparently have this weekly meeting with the president of the united states why haven't [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=463.28s)]
*  y'all proposed that being into law right now think about it until they heard donald trump [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=467.36s)]
*  and that's going to be the interesting part is you know she's doing a 180 on all the border [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=472.48s)]
*  stuff now she's doing uh hey no tax on tips i wonder how long until she adopts another very [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=476.32s)]
*  popular suggestion that donald trump made a week or two ago and that is no tax on social security [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=483.2s)]
*  because that is a good way to get older people over 65 living on social security to vote for you [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=488.48s)]
*  well at one point the voters have to say now you're insulting me now listen uh if you want to do you [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=494.48s)]
*  are running on john on donald trump's plans so most of the stuff that donald trump's running on [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=500.72s)]
*  in terms of keeping the tax rate in place in terms of having a strong border in terms of various uh [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=506.88s)]
*  so protecting strength on foreign policy are 60 approval trump aside these are these are issues [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=512.4s)]
*  that six out of every 10 americans say i fully support so instead of running on what she's done [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=518.72s)]
*  and what she wanted to do in 2020 and she got the nomination she's running as donald trump so [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  the american people have to say at one point it's a little insulting yeah i i don't pretend as if we [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=530.0s)]
*  don't have a uh a television we're not online we're not on social media and understand what this [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=535.52s)]
*  came from the problem is we eat breathe and sleep this that's true we're covering this constantly so [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=540.8s)]
*  we know that he said it first but yesterday i was at a restaurant and the waitress we were talking [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=545.12s)]
*  about no tax on tips how do you feel about it she said both candidates are saying that she had no [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=549.52s)]
*  clue exactly she's one speech away from saying maga i mean she's almost she's gonna say build a wall [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=554.3199999999999s)]
*  i mean she she's that close from doing it but again the campaign strategy is to isolate her [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=560.4s)]
*  and judging by what's happened so far there hasn't been any pushback she has gotten the bump as a [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=566.88s)]
*  result from keeping her away from the american people and if if you don't think it won't work [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=572.32s)]
*  look back in 2020 the same thing that joe bike and it's working right it's working right now [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=577.84s)]
*  voting record if you really want to know what she thinks how she feels what she believes look at her [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=581.5200000000001s)]
*  voting record this truly is the most progressive ticket we've ever had in our country she won an [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=586.72s)]
*  award i don't know if they gave out plaques but she was in 2019 the most uh the most liberal [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedi1KqPSZc&t=591.12s)]
