**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ)

*  Woo. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=33.2s)]
*  So joining us now, those steelworkers [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=35.7s)]
*  who joined Trump on the stage, you have Brian Pavlak, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  you have Richard Tighe, you have Andy Macy, and Glenn Thomas. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=41.599999999999994s)]
*  Hey, guys. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=45.8s)]
*  Hey, good morning. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=47.56s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=48.36s)]
*  OK, so what was it like? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=49.28s)]
*  Richard, I'll start with you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=50.32s)]
*  What was it like to be up there on stage [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=51.2s)]
*  to meet him and to have a chance to talk to him [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=52.82s)]
*  and represent the steel industry? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=55.22s)]
*  It was like a lifetime experience. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=58.1s)]
*  I was glad I got to get my members up there, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=60.94s)]
*  and they got to see him. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=62.82s)]
*  It was like, oh, about my members to me, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=64.22s)]
*  you know, meet Mr. Trump. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=66.38s)]
*  Mr. Trump kind of saved all of our jobs with his tariffs. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=67.74s)]
*  So, Brian, what was the key point for you [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=72.14s)]
*  when you said, I want to do this endorsement among the rank-and-file [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=74.5s)]
*  and I want to do it in front of a crowd? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=77.58s)]
*  Yeah, it was a great experience. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=80.5s)]
*  I'm glad that he accepted it, the endorsement. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=83.1s)]
*  And I just wanted people to know that as a steelworker for Trump, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=86.1s)]
*  I want people to know that all the steelworkers in the Long Valley [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=90.94s)]
*  are for President Trump. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=94.06s)]
*  So, Glenn, I'm curious. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=96.1s)]
*  Typically, union workers in your industry, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=97.42s)]
*  we know them to endorse Democrats. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=100.86s)]
*  Why Donald Trump this go-around? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=103.1s)]
*  Well, historically, we've all been Democrats. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=106.26s)]
*  A couple of us up here are third-generation steelworkers. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=108.61999999999999s)]
*  And we had a trade case years ago [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=112.17999999999999s)]
*  that our ex-international president, Tom Conway, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  was fighting against the Chinese for illegal dumping. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=118.22s)]
*  And when President Trump stepped in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=122.86s)]
*  and he imposed those tariffs on the Chinese, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=125.74s)]
*  I firmly believe that he saved the steel industry, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=128.18s)]
*  not only in our country, but the Long Valley, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=131.34s)]
*  many of us have lived for close to 30 years. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=134.85999999999999s)]
*  Andy, how about you? Why are you supporting Trump? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=138.62s)]
*  Well, number one is to protect the jobs in our Valley. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=141.98s)]
*  I'm a third-generation steelworker. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=146.98s)]
*  I've been through those layoffs. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=149.06s)]
*  It's not fun. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=151.22s)]
*  I've seen three mills shut down in the Valley in the 80s. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=152.78s)]
*  We have three mills left in the Valley. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=157.01999999999998s)]
*  I don't want to see those shut down. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=159.34s)]
*  And he made a firm commitment when I asked him, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=161.22s)]
*  with a handshake, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=164.78s)]
*  Mr. President, after the election, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=166.1s)]
*  will you do what you can to keep our Long Valley [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  viable in the steel industry? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=173.54s)]
*  He gripped my hand and confirmed to me, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=176.02s)]
*  through that handshake, that he says, I will do that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=180.9s)]
*  So, Andy, tell me that's that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=184.62s)]
*  So, you take him at his word. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=187.14s)]
*  Andy, tell me about the business. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=188.66s)]
*  We don't have a steelworker's background. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=190.3s)]
*  If U.S. steel is the quality, that is the world's standard, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=193.29999999999998s)]
*  why is U.S. steel struggling? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=197.5s)]
*  Is it the labor cost, the virtual slave labor [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=199.73999999999998s)]
*  of these other countries that you're competing with? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=203.38s)]
*  Competition, still coming in from other countries. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=207.38s)]
*  We're a world leader. We are. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=211.34s)]
*  We have the most efficient coke plant in the world. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  We meet environmental standards, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=220.62s)]
*  which are very tough to meet in Allegheny County. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=222.38s)]
*  They're getting more strict. We meet those. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=225.5s)]
*  We exceed those. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=228.5s)]
*  Our steel is the best steel that can be made. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=230.66s)]
*  We want to continue that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=235.42s)]
*  We have a pending sale coming up. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=237.42s)]
*  And the problem we have is our international leaders [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=240.82s)]
*  aren't meeting with the CEO from U.S. Steel and from Nippon. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=245.62s)]
*  And over the past year, we've learned facts about this, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=252.38s)]
*  that it's not sitting well with the membership [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=257.58s)]
*  because we are behind the sale. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=260.53999999999996s)]
*  But our international needs to get to the table, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=263.02s)]
*  get the facts, and then bring it to the membership, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=266.86s)]
*  instead of the membership taking it to our international leaders. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=270.7s)]
*  Brian, talk about that Japanese company that's trying to buy it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=275.78s)]
*  Brian, we got about 15 seconds. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=278.3s)]
*  I'm just curious, if Kamala Harris wins, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=280.1s)]
*  what does that mean for your industry? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=284.14s)]
*  We're done. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=286.62s)]
*  I think we're done. It's going to be tough. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=287.62s)]
*  Because she even said if she's elected president, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=289.34s)]
*  she's going to take off the tariffs, all tariffs, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=292.14s)]
*  steel tariffs, all kinds of tariffs. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=294.74s)]
*  She called it the tax on the American people, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=297.5s)]
*  and she's talking about tariffs. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=300.66s)]
*  So we need President Trump elected to save our jobs. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=301.94s)]
*  All right, Richard and Glenn, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=306.54s)]
*  I think they're giving us a little bit more time. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=307.58s)]
*  We did have 15 seconds, but because y'all are so good, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=309.26s)]
*  and this is interesting, we wanted to ask you on the back row, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=311.42s)]
*  why the momentum? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  Why are we seeing that switch more to Donald Trump? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=315.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, you used to think steel workers, unions, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=317.94s)]
*  that's going to the Democrats. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=320.46s)]
*  Once again, he put the tariffs on us [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=323.94s)]
*  when he was president the last time. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=327.34s)]
*  And our jobs are in jeopardy then. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=329.82s)]
*  There's too much dumping of steel from China and other countries. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=332.34s)]
*  You know, he saved our jobs. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=335.86s)]
*  It was one of the first things he did when he got into the presidency [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=337.9s)]
*  is to put those tariffs on, and they worked. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=342.14s)]
*  We've all seen growing up around here in the Pittsburgh area [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=345.41999999999996s)]
*  since the 70s when the Japanese actually did that to us, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=350.41999999999996s)]
*  they dumped steel at extremely low prices. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=357.02s)]
*  It forced a lot of our steel industry, LTV, J&L, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=360.41999999999996s)]
*  some U.S. steel places to close down [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=364.17999999999995s)]
*  because we could not compete. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=366.82s)]
*  When we fought that trade case, they leveled the playing field for us, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=368.61999999999995s)]
*  and then we were able to compete in the world market. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=373.46s)]
*  We want to get back to that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=378.02s)]
*  That's why when you look at the sale to Nippon Steel, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=380.26s)]
*  they want us to be a bigger player in the global market. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=385.05999999999995s)]

*  just to go to the table and meet with them. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=403.98s)]
*  That's all we're asking at this point, meet with them. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=406.66s)]
*  That's important. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=409.34000000000003s)]

*  The rank and file is for it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=415.5s)]
*  Overwhelmingly in the market. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=418.82s)]
*  Because you feel as though they'll be able to put the money in to expand [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=420.86s)]
*  and keep it here. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=424.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=425.5s)]
*  They promised to rebuild. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=426.5s)]
*  We have a hot meal at our urban plant that was built in 1938. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=429.46s)]
*  How do you compete with that, with modern technology today that's available? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=435.65999999999997s)]

*  And that's why we are here to advocate for that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=447.02s)]
*  We have a lot of members in the Mon Valley. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=451.74s)]
*  It's probably 80% of them are less than 20 years. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=454.09999999999997s)]
*  Probably 60% of them are less than 10 years. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=457.9s)]

*  and in the food lines. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=476.65999999999997s)]
*  I did that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=478.09999999999997s)]
*  I don't want to see our members now, our young workers, have to do that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=479.3s)]
*  It's not fun. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=486.98s)]
*  We've all grown up eating the government cheese, the peanut butter [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=487.98s)]
*  and everything else that was given out while our dads were laid off [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=492.62s)]

*  to the west for job opportunities because there was nothing left here. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQzf8k-VvQ&t=503.22s)]
