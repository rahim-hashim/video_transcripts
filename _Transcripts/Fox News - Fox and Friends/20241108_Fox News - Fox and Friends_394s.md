# Hosts break down in laughter over left's Trump meltdown: 'They call us weird?!'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0)
*  If the Democratic Party continues to cater to those type of people, they're gonna keep losing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, just the reaction shows you these are the same people that want the wokeness, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=6.16s)]
*  that want the border to be open, that want the trans ideology stuff, to be in the classroom with children. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=12.24s)]
*  You have to reject this side of your party if you want to start winning average day people. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=18.88s)]
*  Especially she is an average person. She came from a, she was a bartender. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=25.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  She should understand working class. They gotta ask themselves how I lost the working class in America. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=29.04s)]
*  How I lost the people that, you know, actually work for tips. Why are you not responding to them? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=33.92s)]
*  Why are you keeping Amazon out of Long Island City in New York City? Why are you doing that? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=40.4s)]
*  So it's not the only AOC that is the problem. What about some of these Ivy League schools? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=47.2s)]
*  They realize there's some trauma on campus and they've reacted, Ainsley. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, the first one, listen to this. This is an example of what a professor sent to students at Columbia. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=56.32s)]
*  I have decided to cancel our class today. I had planned an alternative lecture on modern polling methods [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  and their blind spots. It feels a bit tone deaf to deliver it today. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=70.0s)]
*  Be good to yourselves and check in on your friends. And apparently some of the Jewish students [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=74.72s)]
*  at Columbia are upset because they said, why didn't you cancel class when we were being yelled at? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=79.92s)]
*  100%. Yeah, scared for our lives. And they're saying you're canceling class because [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=84.88s)]
*  some people feel like that Trump should not be the president. Meanwhile, we couldn't even go on campus [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=90.08s)]
*  and you didn't cancel classes. I wouldn't be surprised if that's some of the gains in New York [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=95.44s)]
*  City for the president. He got 30% of the vote gained in every borough, especially the Bronx, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=98.8s)]
*  because they looked at these anti-Semitic, anti-American protests and they said, really? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  I used to vote a Democrat. I'm going to flip. I think the president added like eight points to the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=107.36s)]
*  New York Jewish vote. We got to stop paying for these schools. If you're a parent out there, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=112.72s)]
*  you can't be sending your kids. I understand that they're supposed to be prestigious, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  but look at what they're teaching this kid. This is a Harvard professor as well. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=121.28s)]
*  As we recover from the eventful election night, this is crazy. Is this a disease or something? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=124.48s)]
*  And process the implications of Trump's victory. Please know that class will proceed as usual [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=130.64s)]
*  today, except the classroom quizzes will not be for credit. Feel free to take some time off as [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=136.64s)]
*  needed. I mean, you're bringing a bunch of weak people. I mean, this isn't after 9-11. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=142.24s)]
*  This is after an election, which was overwhelming. It can't be like, well, I was a nail biter to the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  end. Princeton University. Princeton was my hope. This was in the Princeton, Princetontonian. We [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=153.12s)]
*  have been hearing about lots of anxiety from students about the election and felt like listening [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=158.96s)]
*  circles. Oh my goodness. Listening circles can be a helpful way to allow students to process [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  and get support from one another. This is a weird group of people, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=169.84s)]
*  and they call us weird. I mean, just to understand, a party, a movement, a group of professors, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=174.0s)]
*  that entire theme of their campaign was democracy, saving democracy. And we had a democratic process. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=180.24s)]
*  What a landslide. I mean, it wasn't even close. We're talking about your blue wall that you guys, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=188.0s)]
*  a clean sweep, and you don't respect the will of the people. Well, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=194.08s)]
*  Ari Fleischer, when you interviewed him this morning, he made a good point. It's fascinating. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=198.56s)]
*  He said, when you look at who voted for Kamala Harris, the numbers are interesting. It's flipped. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=203.04s)]
*  Wealthy, wealthy, wealthy people, he said. Over 100,000. Educated, college educated. And he said, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=208.32s)]
*  people without religion. Yeah. The support for Latino vote went up 41 percent, people under 50,000. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=214.88s)]
*  The president dominated for people under 50,000. So that's why when Mayor Pete was on a few days [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=222.4s)]
*  ago and he said the president's going to go in there if Trump wins and give more tax cuts to his [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=227.12s)]
*  billionaire friends, what are you talking about? The people that benefited most was middle class, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=231.6s)]
*  but every bracket benefited. And if you go to his rallies, there's nobody rich there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=236.08s)]
*  These are working class people. So unless they think America has got 70 million of the dumbest [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  people ever, this is what they're saying. But there were people like David Axelrod, I think, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  they're going to do some legitimate evaluation. David Plouffe, legitimate evaluation. I think that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=252.64s)]
*  these people are totally detached and are questioning whether they should stay in America. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=258.08s)]
*  And they don't know what middle America's like. I mean, middle America does have religion. Middle [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=263.2s)]
*  America likes God. They like to take their children to church on Sundays because it teaches you right [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  from wrong. You know, to Brian's point about all the talking points that was put out there before [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=270.88s)]
*  the election, I hope it gives us some type of comfort because I was worried, honestly, in some [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=275.84s)]
*  forms, the mainstream media was, they were so aggressive with the celebrities. And I mean, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=280.64s)]
*  it seemed like, I mean, Ainsley, you would go every day through the lies they were told about [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=285.68s)]
*  the former president, national abortion bans, and I mean, just not Project Whatever, 2020, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  2025, just over and over and over. But the American people, they are smarter and they rejected all the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  talking points that were put out there. You make a good point because think about all the channels, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=302.88s)]
*  ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, CNN, all pro-Kamala, all of those channels, they had an opportunity. Those [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=308.32s)]
*  were free advertisements for her and she still lost. The American people are smart and they know [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=316.16s)]
*  they're better off under Donald Trump and they knew putting her back in was not going to change [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=321.92s)]
*  anything. She already had an opportunity. The funniest thing was watching ABC when Wisconsin [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=326.72s)]
*  and Michigan were going the other way. They kept a guy on the board forever. He'd go, check Milwaukee [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=331.12s)]
*  again. You know, check Grand Rapids. Wait a second. He's like, yeah, I told you, I just [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=335.28s)]
*  gave him some hope. Ain't ballot problems. Anybody got a hanging chat that we could just focus on [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=339.76s)]
*  for a second. The poor guy was sweaty. He's like, I got nothing. This is the votes. So, which is [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  crazy. I'm still on my joy train. I have joy for the American people. I spent a whole week at the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  DNC with false joy and people talking about that the country is so well and the economy is so well. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm so glad that we got a reality check right now. Some indication. And you wonder who's more [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=364.0s)]
*  joyful, Joy Reid or Joy Bayhart? If we can write at friends at FoxNews.com. Sean calls her joyless. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's definitely joyless now. You watch that show a lot. His show or her show? His show, definitely. Every night. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=375.12s)]
*  you [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cBtj-kwzz0&t=393.36s)]
