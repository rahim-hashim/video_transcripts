# Harvard defies Trump admin, faces $2 billion funding freeze #harvard #trump #campusprotests #shorts
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg)
*  When it came to Harvard and the threats against Harvard to straighten out their curriculum, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=0.0s)]
*  to straighten out the anti-Semitism on their campuses, to start complying with some regulations [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=4.4s)]
*  that the administration put out, Harvard pushed back and they said, we will not. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=11.72s)]
*  And the president answered back last night by saying, if you will not, we're taking $2.5 [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=16.5s)]
*  billion from your grant system. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=22.04s)]
*  So there's this task force that is trying to get that money. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Essentially, they've come back and they've said, you know what? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  What the administration is asking us to do is unconstitutional. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=33.6s)]
*  It also flies in the face of our First Amendment rights. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=37.2s)]
*  The president of Harvard, fellow by the name of Alan Garber, sent a letter to the community [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=40.04s)]
*  to explain it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=45.08s)]
*  He said, although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating anti-Semitism, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=46.08s)]
*  majority represent direct governmental regulation of the intellectual conditions at Harvard. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=50.84s)]
*  We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that we will not accept [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=57.28s)]
*  their proposed agreement. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  The university will not negotiate over its independence or its constitutional rights. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  So they've been hit with this $2.2 billion federal freeze. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=66.92s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=70.84s)]
*  I would imagine this is a battle that Harvard's going to fight because while that's $2 billion, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=73.0s)]
*  they've got an endowment at Harvard of $53 billion. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=79.56s)]
*  So they've got a pile of dough they could rely on. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CVgacW2dNg&t=85.62s)]
