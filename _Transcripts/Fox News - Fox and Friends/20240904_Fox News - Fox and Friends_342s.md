# 'Gross negligence': Columbia University BLASTED for allowing anti-Israel protests
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg)
*  So the school year has a chaotic start at Columbia University. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=0.0s)]
*  Anti-Israeli protesters chanting for Hamas to resist until victory. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=3.86s)]
*  Vandalizing statues on campus and valiant to continue the unrest. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=8.28s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=12.08s)]
*  We have been very clear that this will not stop until Columbia has divested from [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=14.08s)]
*  its complicity in Israel's genocide of the Palestinian people. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=17.84s)]
*  I'm a visible Jew. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=20.84s)]
*  I'm orthodox. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=21.72s)]
*  I wear a Star of David around my neck. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=22.56s)]
*  I know that's putting a target on my back. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=24.52s)]
*  And coming to terms with that reality is actually quite frightening. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=26.92s)]
*  There she is. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=31.0s)]
*  Columbia students Shana and Eliana and Ari join us now on set. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=32.2s)]
*  So I guess I'll start with you first ladies, you're freshmen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  You had the opportunity to choose another school, but [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=41.84s)]
*  you all decided to stay here, why? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=45.0s)]
*  I'll let Eliana take that one. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=48.32000000000001s)]
*  So thank you for having us first of all. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=49.8s)]
*  Pleasure. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=52.2s)]
*  Honestly, Barnard has been my dream school. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=53.72s)]
*  Barnard College of Columbia University was my dream school for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=56.24s)]
*  as long as I can remember. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  And I honestly don't find it fair for these students to take away the education [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=60.64s)]
*  that I've dreamed of my entire life and for me to just back down and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=65.84s)]
*  go somewhere else simply because I'm Jewish and simply because I'm a Zionist. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=69.28s)]
*  And what about you? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=73.16s)]
*  Well, like Eliana, I also always wanted to go to Barnard. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  It's a women's college and I'm also in a dual degree program with the Jewish [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=79.36s)]
*  Theological Seminary, so I'm able to pursue a couple of my diverse interests [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=82.0s)]
*  simultaneously. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=86.11999999999999s)]
*  But believe me when I say that I was disheartened and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  appalled to see the events that transpired last year. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  So Ari, it's a little bit different for you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=94.08s)]
*  You're a PhD student. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=96.08s)]
*  You can't just switch programs like that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=98.52s)]
*  Why did you decide to stay at Columbia? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was definitely something that I thought about. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  A good friend of mine actually switched schools last year, so [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=107.63999999999999s)]
*  I miss her a lot. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  But for me, thank God, I'm in the STEM program. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=111.48s)]
*  I work sort of near the back of campus. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  So I do go out and fight when it's necessary. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=117.64s)]
*  But when I need to buckle down and work, I can get away from it all and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  buckle down and work. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  That's not a luxury everyone has. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=123.56s)]
*  Eliana, tell me about the vibe on campus right now. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=125.44s)]
*  Do you feel like there's been any steps put into place to keep you safe? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=129.4s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=134.96s)]
*  First of all, I just want to mention the day before I moved in, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=136.24s)]
*  I published an article in my local Jewish newspaper about my hesitations [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=140.16s)]
*  going to Barnard as an openly Jewish and Zionist student. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=145.0s)]
*  And I expected nobody outside of my community to read it, honestly. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=149.4s)]
*  And only a few hours later, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=153.8s)]
*  it was posted on an anonymous Instagram account that's run by encampment leaders. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=156.24s)]
*  And the hate comments were awful, disgusting. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=162.72s)]
*  And those comments also bled into our group chat of my fellow classmates that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=166.88s)]
*  I hadn't even met yet. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=171.68s)]
*  We moved in the following day. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  And they were asking me how I could even show my face on campus, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=174.84s)]
*  telling me that it's embarrassing for me to even be there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=178.32s)]
*  I don't feel safe on campus even now that I'm here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=181.2s)]
*  From my room, I can hear the protests quite clearly. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=185.16s)]
*  I'm on the second floor facing Broadway. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=188.12s)]
*  Walking through campus, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=191.08s)]
*  I notice flyers being handed out to visibly Jewish students. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=192.2s)]
*  Basically, flyers telling them that they're complicit in genocide. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  And I just feel like there's a target on my back simply for being Jewish. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=200.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=204.04s)]
*  So show, Shana, we've been following this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  And this is some of the experiences that we've been able to document at the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  university. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=211.6s)]
*  So there's been Jewish students that are chased out of their dorm. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=212.16s)]
*  They've been spat on, forced to hide symbols of Judaism. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=214.83999999999997s)]
*  They've been excluded from the student life groups. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=218.76s)]
*  They've been pinned against walls. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=221.56s)]
*  Anti-Semitic slurs and tropes has been shouted at other Jewish students. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=223.68s)]
*  When it comes to the university, has there been some commitment to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=230.44s)]
*  keep you safe on campus or have you walked the class by campus officers or [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=234.6s)]
*  anything like that? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=239.96s)]
*  The short answer is no. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=242.36s)]
*  The administration has made a commitment to ensuring the safety [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=244.76000000000002s)]
*  of Jewish students on campus. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=250.0s)]
*  We're constantly receiving emails from Barnard and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=251.68s)]
*  Columbia saying they want to mend fences. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=254.0s)]
*  With the words. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=256.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=257.2s)]
*  But as much as I appreciate those cliche sentiments, it's all talk and no action. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  Columbia has an anti-Semitism task force that released a pretty damning report of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=264.24s)]
*  anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic incidents that happened on campus this past year. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=270.16s)]
*  And while that was disseminated to the entire university, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  I have not seen tangible examples of the administration taking note of that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=278.64s)]
*  And truly, it's gross negligence. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=284.28s)]
*  And to that point, Ari, what do you want the university to do right now? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=287.28s)]
*  Thanks for that question. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=291.64s)]
*  I want the university to continue what they've been doing in terms of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=294.0s)]
*  making sure that the protesters stay off campus. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=297.24s)]
*  I'd like them to come out really strongly in favor of just basic principles of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  interpersonal decency. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=304.28s)]
*  I mean, look, when you have anti-Semitism working in the shadows and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=305.92s)]
*  you deny it instead of addressing it, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=308.88s)]
*  that sends a pretty clear message about everything else that you're doing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=310.96s)]
*  I mean, and we're not just talking about students. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=314.6s)]
*  You got professors that have openly had anti-Semitic chants within the classroom. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=316.52s)]
*  And now they're still tenured at the university. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=324.08s)]
*  Thank you all so much for joining me this morning. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=327.4s)]
*  I hope things get better on campus. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=328.88s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuXVmLl4tg&t=331.32s)]
