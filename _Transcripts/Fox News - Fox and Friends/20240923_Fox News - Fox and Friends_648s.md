# Peter Doocy: This got kind of awkward
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY)
*  President Biden is heading here to New York City today for the United Nations General Assembly, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=0.0s)]
*  also known as UNGA, around here after appearing to have another gaffe in the world stage. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=6.0s)]
*  Peter Ducey is live at the White House for us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=11.52s)]
*  Hey, Peter. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  And White House officials insisted ahead of time that there be very, very little press [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  coverage of President Biden's meetings over the weekend in Wilmington, Delaware with the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=19.64s)]
*  leaders of Japan and India and Australia. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=23.5s)]
*  The little bit that the press pool was allowed to attend got kind of awkward. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=26.939999999999998s)]
*  So I want to thank you all for being here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=31.34s)]
*  And now, who am I introducing next? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=35.14s)]
*  Who's next? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=41.18s)]
*  Distinguished guests, the Prime Minister of the Republic of India. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=48.42s)]
*  You can see in that clip Prime Minister Modi was sitting right behind President Biden the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=55.1s)]
*  whole time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=58.620000000000005s)]
*  It's unclear why that part of the program was so confusing, although it is worth pointing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  out many of the advanced staffers who have helped President Biden at events like this [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=63.24s)]
*  over the years have moved on to the Harris campaign to help the vice president. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  And there is just one president at a time. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=72.14s)]
*  That's why it's notable that both Biden and VP Harris are conducting their own diplomacy [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=74.34s)]
*  this week. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=79.3s)]
*  They're going to hold separate meetings with the United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=80.3s)]
*  bin Zayed al-Nahyan. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=84.36s)]
*  We saw that when Netanyahu came to the White House a few months ago, they had two different [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=86.44s)]
*  meetings. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=90.28s)]
*  The vice president chose to take a harder line with him, Netanyahu, than President Biden [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=91.28s)]
*  did. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=95.12s)]
*  And the vice president is going to skip the events at the UN General Assembly. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=96.12s)]
*  President Biden will get one more chance in New York City on the East Side to be the solo [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=100.02000000000001s)]
*  headliner of that event. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=105.0s)]
*  But the big thing that he has been talking about for months that he wants to have sewn [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=107.64s)]
*  up by the end of his administration, which is a ceasefire in Israel with Gaza and with [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=112.44s)]
*  rather with Hamas and with Hezbollah appears to be less likely by today as evidenced in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=119.24s)]
*  that report right before us. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=124.36s)]
*  Hey, Peter, why didn't it was the prime minister of India, Japan and Australia. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=125.36s)]
*  They had to go to Wilmington, Delaware, to a hotel there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=129.4s)]
*  Why did normally these events are held at the White House? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=132.64s)]
*  It's an annual meeting. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=135.56s)]
*  Why did they have to go to the president? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=137.04s)]
*  Why didn't they do this in the White House? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=138.44s)]
*  The White House? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=139.76s)]
*  No idea. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=140.76s)]
*  There were many questions about that at briefings over the last couple of days, and reporters [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  have just been told, oh, well, President Biden wants to show these guys where he grew up [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=146.68s)]
*  and all politics is personal. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  And some of the big events with these guys who flew from the complete other side of the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=153.66000000000003s)]
*  world were at President Biden's high school, where he is not it's not a regular place that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=157.88000000000002s)]
*  high level diplomacy happens. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=163.68s)]
*  And it's not a place that they've gone while he's been president. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  It's something that they wanted to squeeze in with the last four months for some reason. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=168.44s)]
*  Probably it would seem just convenience for President Biden. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=174.52s)]
*  Probably. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=177.52s)]
*  So Peter, you have followed and been with Joe Biden for almost six years now. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=178.52s)]
*  And for him to bark out that who's next. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=182.68s)]
*  He was angry. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=185.24s)]
*  You've seen him up close better than anybody at this channel. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=187.52s)]
*  Some have suggested it's cognitive decline. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=191.3s)]
*  Others would probably try to defend the president's just say, well, he didn't know what was going [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=194.08s)]
*  on. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=198.24s)]
*  Was it a stage management thing or something bigger? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=199.24s)]
*  It's based on how I know these events go. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=202.24s)]
*  It probably said on a piece of paper right in front of him who was next. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=206.72s)]
*  And he just was not consulting it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=212.16s)]
*  Peter, it's so interesting. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=214.72s)]
*  But the thing is, if he shouted out who's next, there is no one with the authority in [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  the chain of command to yell out something back to the president in that situation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=221.84s)]
*  So I'm sure somebody was just telling him, look down. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=226.36s)]
*  Are you hearing that other world leaders are told in advance, just protect him? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=228.96s)]
*  Because we've seen this in the past. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=234.44s)]
*  Was it the G7 when a leader had to come over and pull him back over? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  We saw... [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=241.24s)]
*  In Europe, NATO. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=242.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=243.24s)]
*  Are they being told, you know, try to protect him and make him look as good as possible? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=244.24s)]
*  Haven't heard that specifically, but it does seem like these leaders are coming to the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=250.08s)]
*  with the understanding that this is kind of the Biden farewell tour and they have to figure [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=254.08s)]
*  out what it means for their country if Vice President Harris wins or if former President [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=258.48s)]
*  Trump wins in a couple of months. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=263.76s)]
*  Who's next? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=266.24s)]
*  Peter, you're done. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=267.24s)]
*  Who's next? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=268.24s)]
*  I'm sorry, just to wrap this up. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=269.24s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=272.88s)]
*  We just showed you live images of what's happening internationally. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=274.6s)]
*  to have a commander in chief that the Indian Prime Minister is having to save him. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=278.36s)]
*  He's barking out who's next. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  And as Peter says, this protocol is right in front of him and he didn't know. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=286.04s)]
*  I mean, that is just troubling. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=290.08s)]
*  This is a person that is over our military infrastructure and what we're supposed to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=291.76s)]
*  do next and that our allies are asking us, will you have our back? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=296.68s)]
*  What is the next move? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, we've got intel assets all over the world now, but he's responsible for their [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  safety and he doesn't know who's next to speak. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=306.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=310.56s)]
*  It's troubling. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=311.56s)]
*  We need a president that commands attention and empower and we're not getting that here. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=312.56s)]
*  He still has four more months left. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, and to Peter's point, Joe Biden right now is really mad at Israel because he has [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=320.32000000000005s)]
*  wanted Israel to wrap up what's going on with Hamas, you know, for six months and it just [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  keeps going. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=333.24s)]
*  In fact, we have heard through reporting that Jill Biden has said very adamantly, wrap [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=334.36s)]
*  things up, but it just lingers and it's getting bigger. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=339.92s)]
*  And we have two nuggets. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=344.04s)]
*  One, it sounds like Kamala Harris is not going to go to the Al Smith dinner over at the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=345.68s)]
*  Waldorf Astoria. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=351.36s)]
*  Presidential candidates have been going to it for a very long time. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  Walter Mondale ducked the event in 1994. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=356.76s)]
*  And the other thing is regarding Jill Biden saying we've got to wrap this up. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=360.32000000000005s)]
*  Maybe she's saying that because she's running the country. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=366.88000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, she was at the cabinet meeting on Friday. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  She was at the head of the table. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=373.64000000000004s)]
*  Here's a picture of her and I was watching Fox and Friends Weekend and I turn on the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=374.8s)]
*  TV and I see her at the end of the table. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=379.16s)]
*  I'm like, where is he? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=381.12s)]
*  Why isn't he at this meeting? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=383.04s)]
*  There she is. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=385.12s)]
*  Miranda Devine writes, who exactly is running the country? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=386.2s)]
*  It certainly appears to be Jill Biden and not Joe Biden. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=390.16s)]
*  And it goes to the overall question, who's running things and why has it not been asked [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=393.12s)]
*  about the concealment of Joe Biden? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=398.52s)]
*  Everybody saw what happened on the debate stage, but that was almost a revelation to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=399.92s)]
*  people that haven't been plugged in to mainstream media, that haven't, because they haven't [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=403.92s)]
*  been reporting on the story. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=408.64s)]
*  If you haven't been watching Fox, and there's been no question to Kamala Harris on any of [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=409.64s)]
*  the interviews that she's done thus far, not with Oprah, not with ABC, it was definitely [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=414.12s)]
*  not focused on the debate stage. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=418.88s)]
*  None of the cabinet members when they go on the Sunday shows are asked about what is going [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=420.68s)]
*  on in the White House. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=425.44s)]
*  There was a previous report in Dundas that the cabinet meetings were scripted and that [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  questions had to be pre-submitted and now Jill Biden from the secretaries so they could [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=432.28s)]
*  have this all coordinated. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=437.4s)]
*  Well, you know, essentially it looks like, because Joe Biden is in the middle of the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=439.16s)]
*  table on that far side. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=443.56s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't see that over the weekend. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=444.56s)]
*  I didn't know he was there. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=445.92s)]
*  Yeah, he was there. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=446.92s)]
*  And then you've got down at the end his wife, the First Lady, doing all the talking. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=448.12s)]
*  It looks essentially like she is the voice of translator. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=452.24s)]
*  OK, Joe's nodding. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  Let me tell you what the president thinks, which really is what she says. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=457.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's the thesis of Miranda Devine's op-ed today in the New York Post. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=460.56s)]
*  Check it out, nypost.com. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=464.32000000000005s)]
*  She goes on to say, whether it's Jill or somebody else running the country, the bottom [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=466.4s)]
*  line is that we don't have a functional president. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=470.23999999999995s)]
*  This is a constitutional crisis. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=473.47999999999996s)]
*  Kamala Harris is most to blame because she has the constitutional duty as vice president [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=475.52s)]
*  to ensure the president's brain is not AWOL, AWOL. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=480.2s)]
*  She also knows more about Biden's cognitive health than anyone apart from Jill and Hunter [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=484.35999999999996s)]
*  Biden. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=489.23999999999995s)]
*  She has lunch with him regularly and often has boasted of being the last person in the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=490.23999999999995s)]
*  room when decisions are made. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=494.35999999999996s)]
*  She has not. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=495.96000000000004s)]
*  She has been lying through her teeth to the American people about our president. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  It just makes me wonder, Ainsley, all the reporting that came after the debate of all [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=501.8s)]
*  the mainstream media, they started reporting on it suddenly after what we saw in the debate. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=507.8s)]
*  And they were telling us what was happening in the room. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  All of that reporting has stopped. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=513.52s)]
*  Joe Biden is still there. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=515.0s)]
*  The moment they took him off the ticket, they stopped the reporting about what was happening. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=516.16s)]
*  And it makes you wonder, was that the goal? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=521.52s)]
*  It wasn't about transparency. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=523.52s)]
*  It wasn't finally letting the American public know what was happening. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=524.76s)]
*  Otherwise, was it just to get Joe Biden off the ticket? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=527.96s)]
*  So now that you guys have Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, you guys don't want [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=531.36s)]
*  to cover this anymore? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=534.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, I think that since he's not running anymore and he's not the candidate, I don't [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  know if they really care when he says who's next at the podium, because they used to worry [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=540.12s)]
*  how this is going to look, how the optics of this were going to play out for the election. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=545.16s)]
*  Now they don't have to worry about that. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=549.12s)]
*  Miranda Devine says in her article, points out that we do have four more years with him [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=550.64s)]
*  being our president. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=555.28s)]
*  She says the fate of the free world... [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=556.28s)]
*  Four months. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=557.76s)]
*  Four months, sorry, yes. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=558.76s)]
*  The fate of the free world should not be left in the hands of a man who can't remember where [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=559.76s)]
*  he is or what he's meant to be doing at any given moment. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=563.84s)]
*  Well, think about it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=566.92s)]
*  If Miranda Devine got her wish, Joe Biden would be replaced immediately. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=567.92s)]
*  Unfortunately for the Republicans, it would be by Kamala Harris. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=572.88s)]
*  Then the vice president would become president and then essentially would be an incumbent [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=577.16s)]
*  running for reelection. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=581.12s)]
*  And that would, as we have heard from the experts, give her an advantage. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=583.0799999999999s)]
*  So I don't... [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=587.04s)]
*  Maybe not though. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=588.04s)]
*  She'd still have to speak more. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=589.04s)]
*  Well, she would, but just electorally, it would help her. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=590.04s)]
*  The issue should not... [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=594.56s)]
*  And I get your point of view. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=595.8399999999999s)]
*  A lot of Republicans share that point of view. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=597.1999999999999s)]
*  But the issue, frankly, should not be political. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=600.52s)]
*  I mean, it's just a basic functioning government. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=603.24s)]
*  And I don't understand how we've been lectured about threats to democracy. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=606.76s)]
*  And the person that is supposed to protect our republic, who's supposed to be at the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=611.3199999999999s)]
*  top of it, cannot do it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=614.96s)]
*  And everyone knows it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=616.4399999999999s)]
*  And we're supposed to pretend like the country can just be on autopilot for four months when [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=617.4399999999999s)]
*  everything is happening, when it comes to the economy and then international relations. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=622.6s)]
*  Okay, maybe the staff can help us get along for certain things. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=627.28s)]
*  But when it comes to where we stand on the world stage, you can't depend on the staff to do that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMvB8bGEwY&t=631.96s)]
