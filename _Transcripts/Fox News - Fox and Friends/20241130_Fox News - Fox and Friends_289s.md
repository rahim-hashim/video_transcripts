# ‘WAKE UP CALL’: Trans volleyball player prompts multiple forfeits, team soars to conference final
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs)
*  Later today, the San Jose State University women's volleyball team will compete in the Mountain West [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=0.0s)]
*  tournament final. This comes after a transgender athlete on San Jose State's team prompted Boise [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=5.2s)]
*  State to forfeit. That's one of multiple teams that have refused to compete against the player. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Our next guest is the captain of the University of Nevada's women's volleyball team who also [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=17.84s)]
*  forfeited their game against San Jose State back in October during the regular season. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=21.52s)]
*  Sia Li'ili'i joins us now. Sia, thank you so much for being with us this morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=26.24s)]
*  So you're seeing this unfold in the Mountain West tournament, San Jose State forwarding on [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=32.72s)]
*  until the championship game via forfeit. What does it make you think? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=38.48s)]
*  It's unfortunate that it has come to this where women like me in our conference have to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=45.04s)]
*  take a stand and forfeit against these this discrimination that we're facing. But I'm proud [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=53.36s)]
*  of the Boise State team for standing their ground and really standing up for what's right. Really [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=60.0s)]
*  just taking a stand and saying, hey, we're not playing against this biological male because they [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=66.88s)]
*  don't belong in our sports, in our locker rooms, and they don't belong invading women's spaces. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=73.36s)]
*  Now, tell me about, so it's the University of Wyoming, Utah State, Southern Utah State, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=79.44s)]
*  University of Nevada, Boise State, who have forfeited games against San Jose State, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=84.8s)]
*  and again, some of them now in the Mountain West tournament. What do you think, what do you hope [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=88.56s)]
*  and what do you think will be accomplished through the forfeits? I think it sent a really big wake up [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=93.6s)]
*  call to the nation. I mean, right now we're on a national news source and I'm grateful that people [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=101.36s)]
*  are now seeing that this is something that's not going to be swept under the rug and that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=107.2s)]
*  real change needs to happen because the fact that women like me and the women across my conference [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  have to sacrifice something we've worked our whole lives for isn't right. What does it make you feel [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=121.36s)]
*  about teams that choose not to forfeit? Colorado State will be playing against San Jose State in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=127.28s)]
*  the final. Colorado State has chosen not to forfeit. As a side note, three of their members [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=132.24s)]
*  knelt on Friday for the national anthem. What does it make you think about teams that do not [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=138.24s)]
*  forfeit like Colorado State? I think everyone's entitled to their own opinion and everyone should [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  be treated with respect whether or not they agree or disagree with you. I think these women, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  I hope they know that they have people who are supporting them if there are people on their team [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=158.96s)]
*  who don't believe they should be competing against a biological male and that's what I think on that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=163.6s)]
*  I'm curious, do you think it's going to take some type of unanimous action on behalf of women's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=171.52s)]
*  sports, women's teams? In other words, when does this actually affect change? We saw a judge [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  last week choose not to stop San Jose State from playing with a male player. So is it going to take [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=187.52s)]
*  everybody? Is it going to take the Colorado States and San Diego States and then on into the NCAA [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  tournament as well? I'm wondering what you think is the pressure point that actually will get [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=198.96s)]
*  everyone to stand up and make a change? I don't know what that pressure point is but I just know [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=203.84s)]
*  that if there are teams and women who believe that this is not right, we should be heard. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  Should be heard and you're being heard now and we applaud you for making your voice heard but also [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=219.76s)]
*  putting action behind your words. Not without sacrifice, we all know that. Many of these girls, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=225.6s)]
*  as you mentioned, won't move on in the Mountain West tournament, perhaps won't advance to the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  NCAA tournament so they've made a real sacrifice. I think the question is how much sacrifice will [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=234.4s)]
*  be needed in order to effectuate change? See you. We appreciate what you're doing. Last word. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=239.44s)]
*  I see you had one more thing. Last word to you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=244.64s)]
*  I just wish the best of luck to the women who are competing today and I hope everyone sees that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=249.68s)]
*  this is something that's not just going to be put to the side and I encourage girls and women who [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=258.8s)]
*  are facing this discrimination to use their voice and speak out because that's the only way people [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=266.08s)]
*  are going to become aware of this. All right, see you. Lee-E, Lee-E, thank you so much for being [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=272.32s)]
*  with us on Fox and Friends. Thank you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8syvqH1MIs&t=276.96s)]
