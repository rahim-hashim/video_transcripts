# Kamala Harris accused of looking for 'escape hatch' from Trump debate
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860)
*  The Trump campaign says Kamala Harris is looking for an out with just a little more than a week to go until their first debate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=0.0s)]
*  I think that the Harris campaign is looking for an escape hatch. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=7.96s)]
*  They refuse to accept the terms of the debate, which again, everyone had already agreed to it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=10.96s)]
*  We'd agree to it, ABC's agreed to it, the rules are the rules. They're not changing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  But Kamala Harris and her campaign, they're afraid. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=19.84s)]
*  Want to know why? Because she's gonna have to answer for every bit of this last three and a half years. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=22.64s)]
*  A president of district media group and fellow and independent women's forum, Beverly Hallberg, joins me now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=28.28s)]
*  Beverly, cut through all the noise in this. This has been going on for weeks now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=33.2s)]
*  Will they? Won't they? This thing, that thing, Mike's not Mike. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=36.8s)]
*  What's the deal? What's really going on here? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=40.2s)]
*  Well, we're gonna have to wait and find out to see what she actually agrees to. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=44.68s)]
*  But I think the way the Harris campaign is running the campaign is very reminiscent of how Joe Biden ran his Biden or his basement campaign strategy [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=47.44s)]
*  four years ago. It seems that what Democrats want to do is keep Harris out of the spotlight as much as possible. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=57.0s)]
*  Anytime she's not around to teleprompter, they want to keep her quiet. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=63.08s)]
*  I mean, look at the data so far. She has not done a solo interview. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=67.16s)]
*  She has not held a press conference and now a debate, which are the same rules that Joe Biden agreed to during his CNN debate. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=70.8s)]
*  She seems to be having cold feet. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=78.68s)]
*  And so I think this is going to be hard for her team to say that she's not going to do this debate when Joe Biden did it himself. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=81.12s)]
*  And I think the American people are going to demand this debate, but it shows the cold feet for a good reason, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=87.84s)]
*  because I think they honestly see that she's struggling to be able to stay on message. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=93.88s)]
*  And it's also about the optics. Is she optically going to have the type of not just substance, but style that she needs? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=98.68s)]
*  Great question. Trump explaining why he thinks V.P. Harris will only do this debate on one network, that network, ABC. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  But that's the only one she'll go to. Now, the other the other one is the head of ABC is her best friend and her husband's best friend, too. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=115.68s)]
*  And I had to make a decision. Do I want to debate? I'd like to debate. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=124.12s)]
*  To be clear what Donald Trump's talking about, he is commenting on reporting that a very, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=129.08s)]
*  very high level executive at ABC is very close friends with Doug Emhoff and Kamala Harris. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=133.52s)]
*  So with that in mind, to Trump's point, can voters trust ABC to be right down the middle and impartial in this debate with all of America watching? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, this is where America will call them out if they're not. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=151.28s)]
*  Now, I do think that there is always bias when you deal with legacy media. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=153.72000000000003s)]
*  It is not a shock to the American people that ABC is not friendly toward Donald Trump and his policies. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=157.72s)]
*  But I give Donald Trump a lot of credit where he says, I'm willing to go wherever I need to go to debate Kamala Harris. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=164.16s)]
*  And again, it's putting a spotlight on someone who seems afraid to debate him. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=170.0s)]
*  And so I think he's putting her in this tough position of having to say yes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=175.24s)]
*  Again, it's the same rules that Joe Biden agreed to. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=179.4s)]
*  Why won't Kamala Harris agree to those same rules? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=182.4s)]
*  I think at the end of the day, we're going to see her next week on that debate stage, and I think the rules are going to stay as is. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=185.44s)]
*  Let's create a hypothetical here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=191.96s)]
*  Neither party can really claim victory on September 10th at 11 o'clock once the debate is over. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=193.8s)]
*  Both sides claim some sort of victory. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=200.8s)]
*  Basically, what I'm saying is it's not a bloodbath like June 26 when Joe Biden and Donald Trump debated. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=203.68s)]
*  Do you think they do a second debate? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=209.12s)]
*  I don't think so at this point. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=213.24s)]
*  I would love more debates. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=214.56s)]
*  I'm always going to push for that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=215.96s)]
*  But I think this is what both candidates need to accomplish. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=217.44s)]
*  Now, for Donald Trump, who is very quick on his feet, I think he has to be careful about looking like a bully towards Kamala Harris. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=220.48s)]
*  Stick to the policies. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=227.52s)]
*  Leave the personal insults alone. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=228.68s)]
*  Let Kamala Harris bury herself. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=230.68s)]
*  Now, on Kamala Harris's standpoint, she cannot have word salad. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=233.44s)]
*  She has to seem commanding. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=236.96s)]
*  And even in her recent interview with CNN where she had Tim Walsh on her side, the eye contact was poor. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=238.36s)]
*  There was hesitancy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=244.4s)]
*  She has to come out in a commanding way. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=245.8s)]
*  And I think if she doesn't, this could be really bad for her. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=248.0s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be as significant as the Biden debate. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=251.24s)]
*  But I think this could seal the deal for whether or not people think Kamala Harris is competent enough, especially in communication, in order to be president. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=254.56s)]
*  So if we remember back to what we're calling the Biden debate soon thereafter, actor George Clooney wrote an op ed basically calling on Joe Biden to step down. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=263.0s)]
*  And he was questioned about it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  His answer? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=273.4s)]
*  Curious. Listen. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=274.52s)]
*  You know, I've never had to answer that question, so I suppose I'll do it here. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=276.79999999999995s)]
*  The person who should be applauded is the president who did the most selfless thing that anybody's done since George Washington. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=284.56s)]
*  And that's true. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=291.76s)]
*  Except Beverly, George Washington didn't have an op ed from a popular actor at the time demanding that he step down. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  Where's the shame in George Clooney, Beverly? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=301.64000000000004s)]
*  It really is quite rich. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=305.8s)]
*  And I actually view this as typical bullying tactics. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=307.32000000000005s)]
*  Here you had George Clooney who didn't do this on his own. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=311.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't think he wrote this op ed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=313.6s)]
*  He has ghost writers. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=315.0s)]
*  I think he had Democrats behind him put an op ed out, forcing Joe Biden to leave as well as other Democrats forcing him. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think the deal they gave him was if you do this, we are going to praise you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=323.32000000000005s)]
*  We're going to talk about putting you on Mount Rushmore. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=327.64000000000004s)]
*  We're going to call you selfless. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=329.68s)]
*  We are going to make comparisons to George Washington and being the best president who ever lived. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=331.28s)]
*  I think this was his concession prize, so to speak, by actually caving to their bullying tactics. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=336.0s)]
*  Again, I don't think the American people buy it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=341.88s)]
*  Most people see it for what it is. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=344.52s)]
*  But apparently with Democrats, they still go on with the same narrative, whether or not it's true. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=346.52s)]
*  George Washington didn't spend 16 straight days at a beach. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=350.76s)]
*  George Washington's experience with water was a crossing the Delaware and basically winning the Revolutionary War. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=354.23999999999995s)]
*  Beverly Hallberg, we appreciate your time. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=361.0s)]
*  Have a great Labor Day. We appreciate you. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNNMl53k860&t=362.91999999999996s)]
