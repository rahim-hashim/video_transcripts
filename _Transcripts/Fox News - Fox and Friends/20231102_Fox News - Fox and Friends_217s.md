# Hamas 'stunned' and 'overwhelmed' by the 'amount of force' in Israeli war: Expert
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI)
*  The US reportedly sent special forces to Israel to assist in finding the hostages held captive by Hamas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=0.0s)]
*  The Times quote in New York Times quoting an assistant secretary of defense saying quote [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=5.46s)]
*  We're actively helping the Israelis to do a number of things identify hostages including American hostages [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=9.32s)]
*  Is it it's really our responsibility to do so they got Americans [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Odette alum is a 24-year veteran of massage joins us now to react Odette [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=18.84s)]
*  It's not going to be easy to find them, but something's going on because the number of hostages is going up [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=23.46s)]
*  It's changing. They're getting some intelligence. Can you go behind the scenes with us? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=29.779999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, thank you for having me and I must praise Fox for your unbiased reports. Thank you in general [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=35.06s)]
*  true journalism [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=42.099999999999994s)]
*  Yeah [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=43.86s)]
*  referring to the hostages number it's going up because as we [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=45.42s)]
*  Get inside a Gaza [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=51.94s)]
*  Naturally we gather intelligence we gather [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=54.86s)]
*  materials together documents that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=58.22s)]
*  Put a light on the actual number of the hostages and this is the reason it changes from time to time [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=63.18s)]
*  So I want to give you a quote from another member of Merced [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=72.38s)]
*  Yossi Cohen says we cannot wait quietly for proposals for deals without entering the Gaza Strip [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=76.9s)]
*  It's it is possible necessary to eliminate the rule of Hamas and at the same time be open to mediating future deals [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=81.53999999999999s)]
*  For the release of hostages a better yet. Yeah better yet a dead. How about rescuing him? We got one already [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=87.54s)]
*  So do you think that to a degree Hamas did not predict the ferocity of the response? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=94.14s)]
*  They're getting while you guys are pushing back on the outcry to pause and ceasefire. Do you think it's surprising them? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=101.66s)]
*  Absolutely, I think they're stunned by the amount of force that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=111.3s)]
*  We are actually putting into into the battle [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  They are stunned by the tactics that we are using and they are [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=119.58s)]
*  overwhelmed by the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  nature of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=129.62s)]
*  our [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=130.82s)]
*  Attack and the ferocity they didn't plan it [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=131.85999999999999s)]
*  They didn't anticipated that it wasn't part of their overall game [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=134.7s)]
*  And so right now they are trying to maintain some sort of survival [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=139.54s)]
*  And we are pushing the enclave as much as we can forward in order not to allow them to escape [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=145.85999999999999s)]
*  And of course, there is the issue of our hostages [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=153.73999999999998s)]
*  We've got 17 guys have already lost their lives [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=158.18s)]
*  So we know how tough the battle is but the amount of intelligence [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=160.57999999999998s)]
*  That were you're probably getting from them on the tunnels on the locations from the rescued hostages [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=164.22s)]
*  I guess it's plentiful. Wouldn't you think final thought? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=169.62s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think it is I mean [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  So far we see the the whole apparatus of the Hamas is crumbling [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  And it's crumbling because of the nature of the attack [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=184.01999999999998s)]
*  the nature of the ground intelligence that we are gathering and of course the ferocity of of the attacks, I'm not saying [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=189.06s)]
*  We are close to the end, but we're getting there [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=197.77999999999997s)]
*  Right. My hope is somebody in the Palestinian side be somebody you can deal with so far [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=201.22s)]
*  We've not seen that Hamas does represent the Palestinians. There's been no push to separate [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=206.26s)]
*  Oh, thank you so much. Appreciate it. We'll call on you again if that's okay [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pdYPbl7AI&t=211.22s)]
