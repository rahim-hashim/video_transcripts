# Biden called out for failure to respond to attacks on US troops
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o)
*  Right now, take a look. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=0.0s)]
*  You're going to see all these contractors and see their logos up there because according [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=1.24s)]
*  to a government threat advisory, all there's going to be a day of action and protest in [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=5.28s)]
*  front of all these buildings and these major companies. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=10.44s)]
*  I'm talking about rallies. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about marches. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about sit-ins. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about propaganda actions and stuff. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=16.04s)]
*  We don't know exactly what will happen. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Employees are warned. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  If you find yourself in the middle of it, leave immediately. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Here to react, Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=24.2s)]
*  In general, they're protesting for the Palestinians and for Hamas. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=26.0s)]
*  What would you say to these people who are helping build up our defense base? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=30.36s)]
*  Yeah, Brian, thanks for having me. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=35.04s)]
*  Look, they're going to be protesting from the headquarters. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Fortunately, they're probably not going out to any of the factories that are out there. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=40.64s)]
*  Well, look, our defense industrial base is critical to us. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=43.84s)]
*  We've really cut it back and Americans need to realize this is very, very important to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=46.8s)]
*  us as we go into the future. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=51.2s)]
*  And I'll just use one simple example. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=52.84s)]
*  Look at the problems we've had on making 155-millimeter ammunition, howitzer ammunition, that we send [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=55.6s)]
*  to Ukraine and build up our stocks. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  We've actually had to move ammunition from those stocks into Israel, much like we use [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  those stocks from Israel into Ukraine. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  So all these defense industrial-based companies are very critical to us. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=72.48s)]
*  I wouldn't worry so much about the demonstrations, primarily because it's in front of the headquarters. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=77.08s)]
*  It's not in front of the factories, which would really be a problem. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=81.2s)]
*  Right, and in general, any person who wants to be president has to understand the threats [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=83.76s)]
*  that are out there. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=87.4s)]
*  And if they don't start expanding our military industrial base that everyone thought wanted [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=88.4s)]
*  to take over the world, we're not going to be able to help our allies, who will write [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=93.16s)]
*  checks and pay us for this in a for-profit business. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=96.88s)]
*  I want to talk to something else. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=100.48s)]
*  Now can we go to that map that shows the danger in this region? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  Because of these guys and because of what's happening in Lebanon and what's happening [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=105.16s)]
*  in Gaza, there is a huge danger to our troops, 45,000, but predominantly the most in danger [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  in Syria, as well as over in Iraq. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  They are being rocketed regularly, 45 injuries, a lot of it TBI, and we have not struck back [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=120.04s)]
*  except one time at a weapons depot. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=126.76s)]
*  General, are you worried for our people and the families watching right now? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=129.16s)]
*  All right, Brian, absolutely. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=133.16s)]
*  Look, to use a phrase, we really dodged a bullet on this simply because we have an [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=135.64s)]
*  entity of Americans killed in these attacks. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=139.88s)]
*  You know, Jackie Heinrich last night, or in yesterday's press conference, asked about [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=142.04s)]
*  those attacks, and Kirby made the comment about two F-16s striking an arms depot. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=145.83999999999997s)]
*  And look, why don't we see the gun tapes of that? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=151.48s)]
*  Because it probably didn't need anything but sand. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  We've got enormous capability in the Middle East, two carrier strike groups, an amphibious [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=156.56s)]
*  ready group, the B'Tan. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=160.42s)]
*  We've just had an Ohio-class guided missile submarine pass through the Suez Canal in the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=161.92s)]
*  Red Sea. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  That carries 150 T-Lams. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  It's not the capacity and it's not the capability of the military forces there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=170.48s)]
*  It's the will of the President of the United States. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=175.04s)]
*  And I really believe that this president, it's in his DNA to be very, very cautious [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=177.11999999999998s)]
*  and very conservative. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=183.04s)]
*  I've been in those meetings in the Situation Room. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  I've been in those meetings in the Oval Office. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=186.56s)]
*  Those are hard decisions. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=188.82s)]
*  I understand the risk. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=190.11999999999998s)]
*  I get it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  But you're going to have to make those hard decisions to respond against them because [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=192.67999999999998s)]
*  every time these attacks occur against U.S. facilities and troops, it just emboldens them [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  because they say, well, look, they're not going to attack back. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=201.57999999999998s)]
*  They need to come up with a plan and a process to do it and then execute. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  They've got the capability. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=207.72s)]
*  They've got the capacity. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  They can create enormous destruction. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=210.44s)]
*  And I haven't seen the signal that we've sent, except those two F-16s, that we've sent anything [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  to the Iranians, which is a state designated sponsor of terrorism. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=218.46s)]
*  I just don't understand it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=223.46s)]
*  It's just so unbelievable that we let our people be sitting ducks like that and injuries [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=224.94s)]
*  are mounting up. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=229.36s)]
*  General, thanks so much. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=230.36s)]
*  General Kellogg, I wish you were in that situation. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=231.36s)]
*  We might feel a lot better. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=233.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=235.14000000000001s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592S_bH0h5o&t=236.14000000000001s)]
