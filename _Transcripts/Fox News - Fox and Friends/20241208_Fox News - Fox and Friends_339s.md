# House Majority Whip blasts Dems for 'organized smear' campaigns over Trump Cabinet picks
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA)
*  A busy week on Capitol Hill for President-elect Trump's cabinet picks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=0.0s)]
*  Pete Hegseth will be back for another meeting with Senator Joni Ernst early this week. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=8.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, DNI pick Tulsi Gabbard is set to start meeting with GOP senators and likely [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=12.96s)]
*  will face scrutiny over views, including on Syria, a 2017 trip where she met with Bashar [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=17.14s)]
*  al-Assad himself. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  House Majority Whip Tom Emmer joins us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=24.96s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=28.740000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Congressman, let's talk about, let's walk through the cabinet picks together for just [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=29.74s)]
*  a moment. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=33.14s)]
*  Pete is the center of attention right now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=34.62s)]
*  How do you feel we stand here today with the chances for Pete Hegseth's confirmation as [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=37.22s)]
*  Secretary of Defense? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=41.78s)]
*  Well, this may surprise some people who are watching, but Republicans in Washington, D.C., [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=42.78s)]
*  are absolutely united behind Donald Trump's picks for his cabinet. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=47.42s)]
*  He's come to Washington, Will, and he's shaking up the status quo. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=52.94s)]
*  You can't fix what's been broken over the last 30 years and in particular over the last [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=57.02s)]
*  four years. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=61.38s)]
*  You can't fix what they broke with the same people who broke it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=63.300000000000004s)]
*  So he's bringing people from the outside, people with fresh new ideas. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=67.28s)]
*  They will bend the curve when it comes to thought about what we're going to do with [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=70.7s)]
*  our Department of Defense, what we're going to do with all of these different executive [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=74.42s)]
*  agencies that, quite frankly, have been running on their own initiative for years. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=78.54s)]
*  I love that you said Republicans will align with Donald Trump's pick, his vision for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=82.98s)]
*  America. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=88.42s)]
*  But it is right now Republicans that people are concerned about when it comes to confirming [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=89.42s)]
*  these cabinet picks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=92.98s)]
*  Joni Ernst, we'll see after meetings with Pete Hegseth this week. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=94.7s)]
*  It looks like it's headed in a positive direction. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=97.62s)]
*  Do you feel confident? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=100.9s)]
*  You've whipped votes in the House. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=102.78s)]
*  You know John Thune. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=104.3s)]
*  He whips in the Senate. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=105.3s)]
*  Are you feel confident Republicans will live up to what you just said? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  They will fall behind Donald Trump's picks in the Senate. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=109.98s)]
*  Very confident with the picks that he has out there right now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=113.02000000000001s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=115.58s)]
*  And Pete Hegseth, Pete Hegseth is a warrior. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=116.58s)]
*  He's a hero. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=120.38000000000001s)]
*  He's a Minnesota hero who actually experienced combat, unlike our governor who said he was [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=121.38000000000001s)]
*  in combat but never went. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=125.94s)]
*  He's exactly the right choice and this is what he'll be communicating with all of these [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=128.74s)]
*  senators about to change the Harris-Biden culture at the DOD. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=132.66s)]
*  They seem to be more concerned with this woke nonsense than they are in having a military [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=137.2s)]
*  apparatus that actually does its job. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=141.95999999999998s)]
*  And what you're talking about, by the way, war fighters lining up to publicly announce [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  their support for Pete Hegseth. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=147.44s)]
*  We're going to talk about that more throughout the morning. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=148.44s)]
*  It's coming together, including veterans of the Afghan evacuation who are signing their [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  name in support of Pete Hegseth. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  Real quick, Democrats. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  Think there's any Democrats that will come over? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, obviously we're all looking at John Fetterman. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=160.2s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=163.24s)]
*  Democrats got a real smack in the face on November 5th. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=164.68s)]
*  All of these things that they've been doing, the transgender stuff, boys and girls sports, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=167.88s)]
*  it isn't what America wants. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=172.96s)]
*  America wants Trump's America First agenda. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=175.36s)]
*  It's about creating an economy that works for everybody again, unleashing American energy, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=177.8s)]
*  securing the southern border, creating peace and stability around the globe. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  That's what people are hungry for. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=186.44s)]
*  Democrats had the wrong message and I think you're going to see some Democrats. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=188.28s)]
*  I give you an example, maybe one senator in Georgia who's going to have a real tough [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=191.4s)]
*  reelection in a couple of years that's got to look at what do his people actually expect. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=195.52s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=200.56s)]
*  You saw it on November 5th. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=201.56s)]
*  I think people like the senator in Georgia are going to be looking very carefully about [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=202.56s)]
*  huh, I better start reacting to what the people actually want. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=206.68s)]
*  I better start listening to them. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=211.16s)]
*  That will be fascinating to watch. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=212.6s)]
*  Maybe not just Senator John Fetterman. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=213.88s)]
*  I don't know if it will include John Fetterman, but several possible Democrats. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=215.84s)]
*  Let's move though beyond Hegseth for a moment because you said you think Republicans will [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=219.2s)]
*  align behind Donald Trump's picks, plural. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=223.2s)]
*  Now attention moves to Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=225.83999999999997s)]
*  I imagine by the way after attention focuses on Tulsi Gabbard, it will continue to move [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=228.48s)]
*  on. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=232.11999999999998s)]
*  It could possibly then move to RFK. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=233.11999999999998s)]
*  Do you see united Republican support for Tulsi, for RFK? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, remember everybody, human beings are emotional animals. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=238.72s)]
*  So when this smear campaign begins, much like it has with Pete Hegseth, I mean you've got [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=242.0s)]
*  to look at the allegations against Pete Hegseth are from all anonymous sources. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=247.12s)]
*  This is what they do. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=252.44s)]
*  This is an organized effort by Democrats to smear these picks. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  When it doesn't work with Pete Hegseth, when he goes around and he convinces these senators [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=258.96s)]
*  of who he really is as opposed to what they want him to believe, they'll move on to Tulsi [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=262.72s)]
*  Gabbard and we'll probably get the same experience with Tulsi. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=267.68s)]
*  Once they take care of that, then we'll probably get the same experience with RFK. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=271.16s)]
*  And it's a two level fight because you're right to point to Democrats because essentially [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  the media and Democrats are inseparable. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=279.12s)]
*  They're one and the same. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=281.12s)]
*  So the attacks begin in the media, but the second level is how those fights in the media [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=282.12s)]
*  affect Republican senators. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=286.28s)]
*  Because the GOP has 53 Senate seats. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=288.52s)]
*  You can confirm all of Donald Trump's picks tomorrow if Republicans are united. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=290.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, and that's what we need to do. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  This administration needs to be running on day one. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=297.29999999999995s)]
*  If you look at the House for instance, the Whip's office that I run has been having [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  member listening sessions for months getting ready for reconciliation next year. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=303.64s)]
*  We are not sitting still. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=308.56s)]
*  Neither is the Senate. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=310.08s)]
*  Once we come in in January and it can't come quick enough, you've got to be ready to move. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=311.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  Congressman Tom Emmer, always great to see you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  Good to see you, Will. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  No, just a good old equal handshake with Congressman Tom Emmer. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=326.76s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82K5cdSFePA&t=327.76s)]
