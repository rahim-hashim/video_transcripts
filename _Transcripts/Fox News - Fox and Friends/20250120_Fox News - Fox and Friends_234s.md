# Kamala Harris greets JD Vance for pre-inauguration tea
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8)
*  So, President Trump will be holding at Blair House for about 15 minutes, we're told, maybe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=0.0s)]
*  about 13 minutes from here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=3.84s)]
*  We continue to see some family members who are our guests of the president and first [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=5.68s)]
*  lady from the St. John's service. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=9.98s)]
*  In the meantime, this morning, Joe Biden made some news, Carl. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  He did some preemptive pardons today as we look at the vice president, Kamala Harris, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=16.92s)]
*  and her husband, the second gentleman, Doug Emhoff. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=21.68s)]
*  Maybe we're going to see. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  That's not stopping. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  What about these preemptive pardons on his way out? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=30.24s)]
*  Well, first, it's distressing that we that he felt he needed to do that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=34.199999999999996s)]
*  And I thought Adam Kitzinger said who was the who's the recipient of one of those pardons [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=39.08s)]
*  and objected to it said I didn't do anything wrong. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=43.68s)]
*  I don't need to be pardoned. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=46.4s)]
*  But it is it is a it is a is it says something about the state of where we are as a country, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=48.08s)]
*  the division of the polar. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=54.92s)]
*  And here we have let me just jump in here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=55.92s)]
*  There is Vice President elect J.D. Vance and his lovely wife, Usha. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=58.12s)]
*  They have three children. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=64.12s)]
*  And this is the moment where they are going to meet the Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  And then they'll go inside Bill for tea. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=70.92s)]
*  There she is in a beautiful pink coat. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=74.6s)]
*  And. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=88.08s)]
*  Very British that they go for tea, not coffee. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=109.36s)]
*  You know, Dana and Carl, just learning the protocol takes a minute. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=118.12s)]
*  And that was pretty. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=122.64s)]
*  And that was very gracious. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=123.72s)]
*  It sure was. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  And we all do it for each other. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was kind of a cute moment, actually. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=129.4s)]
*  So they'll go in, they'll sit down, they'll start their conversation. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=131.44s)]
*  And, you know, Carl, I asked Senator Thune this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=135.6s)]
*  He let off our coverage about half an hour ago. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=138.68s)]
*  And how much consideration have you given to the political accomplishment that Trump [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=141.28s)]
*  has done here through the court cases and the assassination attempts in January six [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=146.08s)]
*  to four years ago and the fact that he's we have not seen his kind to win a nonconsecutive [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  term since the 1890s. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=157.24s)]
*  You're a historian, frame it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=159.4s)]
*  Well, we've never seen anything like this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=162.52s)]
*  This is nothing like Cleveland's return in 1892. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  The 1888 election had been very close. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=168.08s)]
*  The 1892 election was similarly close. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  But in the intervening four years, Cleveland had sort of retired to New York and had kept [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=174.48s)]
*  his political life alive. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=180.92s)]
*  But, you know, he suffered nothing like Donald Trump has suffered in the last four years and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=182.2s)]
*  persevered. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=188.24s)]
*  I mean, there's nothing with 100 years from now, people will be writing about the extraordinary [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=189.52s)]
*  political comeback, the most extraordinary in America's history of Donald Trump with the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=195.12s)]
*  number of lawsuits and declared dead in January six and so forth and so on. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=200.92s)]
*  And he comes back to beat not the man that he started out running against in 2023, but [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=205.56s)]
*  the vice president after the president is withdrawn from the ticket and declines to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=212.76s)]
*  run in July of 2024. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=218.76s)]
*  It's this an extraordinary political story. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=221.44s)]
*  And most compelling analysis. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbQUhHqDN8&t=230.88s)]
