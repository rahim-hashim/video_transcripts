# Tom Homan, Mayor Adams reveal 'game changer' move on ICE deportations
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I)
*  Well, it has been a very busy week for New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=0.0s)]
*  The Department of Justice earlier this week dropped corruption charges against him, and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=4.5s)]
*  yesterday he met with Border Czar Tom Homan about the next steps in fighting New York [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=8.86s)]
*  City's migrant crisis. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=14.94s)]
*  How'd it go? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=16.22s)]
*  Well, Mayor Adams and Tom Homan, join us right now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=17.22s)]
*  Guys, great to see you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=20.02s)]
*  Good morning together. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=21.02s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=22.02s)]
*  Make some news. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=23.02s)]
*  Mr. Mayor, from your perspective, how did this meeting go? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=24.02s)]
*  Why was it necessary? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=26.54s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=27.54s)]
*  I think that, and Tom can speak for himself, I think he had a real level of frustration, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=28.54s)]
*  and he was trying to figure out what's going on, Eric, what is happening. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=34.42s)]
*  And we were able to get in the room and really articulate, what are my powers, what are my [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=38.46s)]
*  authorities, and what are some of the things that we need to legislatively address that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=43.62s)]
*  is preventing us from doing what we want to do, and that is getting dangerous people off [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=48.56s)]
*  our streets. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=52.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=53.66s)]
*  Tom Homan, as you know, Mayor, a couple days ago said he was angry at you in New York City [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=54.779999999999994s)]
*  because it sounds like last time you guys got together over at Gracie Mansion, you probably [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=60.099999999999994s)]
*  said some stuff, maybe we'd like to do this and that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=64.38s)]
*  I think, Mr. Homan, and Tom, you can start with this, you were frustrated that he wasn't [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=67.53999999999999s)]
*  doing enough. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=72.46s)]
*  He wasn't keeping up his end of the deal. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=73.46s)]
*  Well, you know, I've been on the network for four years, and I've called the mayor out [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=75.5s)]
*  many times for not stepping up when it comes to public safety threats. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=80.22s)]
*  I tell you, when I sat down with him, I saw the cop in him, and he really does want to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=84.06s)]
*  do the right thing because he is a cop. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=87.62s)]
*  He is a lifelong cop. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=88.62s)]
*  He wants to help take public safety threats off the streets of New York, making New York [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=89.62s)]
*  safer. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=94.42s)]
*  He also wants to help find these missing children. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=95.42s)]
*  We've got 300,000 missing children, and many of them are here in this city, we know that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=98.34s)]
*  We've got to find them, and we'll be working with his intelligence division, his officers, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=102.5s)]
*  to save these children because many of these children are in forced sex trafficking, many [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=107.26s)]
*  are in forced labor. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=110.22s)]
*  We need to save them. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  And I think everybody can agree to that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=112.46000000000001s)]
*  I don't care what side the political spectrum you're on. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=114.46s)]
*  And you know, people want to hijack this narrative and turn it into a political narrative where [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=115.94s)]
*  we're saying we need to have public safety. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  I requested the meeting. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=122.5s)]
*  I reached out to his team and said, we want to sit down. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=123.62s)]
*  This has been an issue I was talking about before the election. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=127.74s)]
*  Spring of 2022, you look at these quotes over and over again, we need to go after these [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=131.06s)]
*  dangerous people in our street. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=135.82s)]
*  And now I have someone that understands that narrative, and we are fighting together to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=137.22s)]
*  get it done. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=141.54s)]
*  Tom has been on our network so many times saying he felt like ICE's hands were tied [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=142.57999999999998s)]
*  under the last administration. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  You've agreed to sign an executive order to open up an ICE office at Rikers Island so [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=148.06s)]
*  that these dangerous criminals that are here illegally can be deported. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  Tell the folks at home, because they'll hear this, they'll say, oh, they're going to come [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=156.45999999999998s)]
*  after me next. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=158.85999999999999s)]
*  You said these are the worst of the worst. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  So who is at Rikers Island that will be deported? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=162.06s)]
*  What have they done? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=164.66s)]
*  And you bring in two points where the far left has hijacked this narrative. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=165.66s)]
*  Oh, ICE is running in our schools. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  ICE is running in our churches. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=173.26000000000002s)]
*  And they are bringing, creating this frenzy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=175.22s)]
*  They're not in the business of just grabbing children. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=178.5s)]
*  And we need to, you know, just stop all this noise. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=181.58s)]
*  Rikers Island, particularly after all the reforms, Rikers Island is now having some of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=185.58s)]
*  the most dangerous people in our city. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=191.34s)]
*  And by having ICE on Rikers Island, part of our gang intelligence, using our intel with [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=193.62s)]
*  NYPD, correction officers, we can identify those gangs inside and outside on the street. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=199.66s)]
*  There was no reason they were removed from Rikers Island. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=205.22s)]
*  And as I sat down with Tom earlier, I said that we're going to look at all the legal [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=208.7s)]
*  leads. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=212.94s)]
*  I'm able to do an executive order to put them back on Rikers Island, what they should be [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=213.94s)]
*  were part of our criminal justice apparatus. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=217.26s)]
*  You have a left-wing legislature. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=219.14s)]
*  Everybody knows it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=220.94s)]
*  For some reason, nobody votes in New York, so the same left-wingers get in every time. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=221.94s)]
*  But if you had your druthers, would New York City be a sanctuary city? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=225.82s)]
*  What we will always be. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=230.29999999999998s)]
*  This has always been a city of immigrants. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=231.42s)]
*  So you think it should be? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  No, no, but let me explain because this is what's been conflated all the time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  When a sanctuary city is stated that if you're in this city and you're paying taxes, you [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=238.89999999999998s)]
*  should have access to the services, what I ask the city council to do, change the bill [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  that was already in place and modify it that if you are committing a crime, that we should [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=251.78s)]
*  be able to collaborate with ICE even on civil enforcement if you have committed a crime. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=257.58s)]
*  That part of the bill is wrong. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=263.18s)]
*  But everyday people who are here and they're moving to be documented, if they are going [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=265.06s)]
*  to school, working, paying taxes, then they should be able to provide police services, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=270.7s)]
*  hospital services, children should go to school. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=274.86s)]
*  That is what we're seeing. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=277.22s)]
*  You don't agree with that, Tom? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=278.22s)]
*  I don't agree. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=280.18s)]
*  Sanctuaries are for criminals. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  We walked out of a meeting yesterday and getting back in Rutgers Island is a game changer. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=284.18s)]
*  Not only do we get the bad guys where they hit the street, the intelligence of how the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=289.74s)]
*  TDA operates, where they're operating, all this intelligence they gather at Rutgers Island [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=294.54s)]
*  we'll have access to. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=297.82s)]
*  But no, I'm strictly against sanctuary city status just because I think sanctuaries are [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=299.22s)]
*  for criminals. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=304.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=305.7s)]
*  They're a magnet. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=306.7s)]
*  But the beauty here is that we're allowed to disagree. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=307.78s)]
*  But we do agree on the fundamental that no matter who you are, it should be saved. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=312.09999999999997s)]
*  So that's what people are missing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=316.7s)]
*  My life is sitting down with people I don't agree with 100% of the time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=319.3s)]
*  I don't agree with myself 100% of the time. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=322.86s)]
*  But when Tom and I are in a room, we're both saying one thing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=325.26s)]
*  No matter who you are, if you're hurting innocent people in this city and in this country, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=329.46s)]
*  you don't have a right to be in our country. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=334.14s)]
*  Well here's the thing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=335.7s)]
*  You can disagree on things. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=337.14s)]
*  But Tom has made it very clear that if a politician stands in the way of the federal government [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=338.58s)]
*  executing the law, they are going to bring charges against people like you. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=343.9s)]
*  And in fact we've seen the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, go after officials already. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=348.3s)]
*  So was that part of the conversation yesterday? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=353.62s)]
*  No, I think it needed to be. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=355.9s)]
*  We talked very frankly about first of all, getting to Rutgers Island, step one. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=358.46s)]
*  That's the first step. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=362.34s)]
*  We're working on some other things that we don't really want to talk about in our open [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=363.94s)]
*  air just because the city council will be putting roadblocks upon us. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=366.66s)]
*  But the mayor and me have committed to several other things to make this city safer. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=371.38000000000005s)]
*  For the collaboration again, city council, I don't like them. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=378.5s)]
*  I think Mayor Adams is dealing with these, the sanctuary law, right, that an EO can't [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=382.5s)]
*  override. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=388.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=389.18s)]
*  So we're working on some things to work around some of these things. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=390.18s)]
*  You're being careful the way you're describing it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=394.06s)]
*  I've got to be very careful because the city council, they hate me, right? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=395.9s)]
*  The city council, they don't want immigration enforcement in this city. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=398.53999999999996s)]
*  So we've got to make sure that we collaborate in a smart way so we can get more bad guys [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=402.17999999999995s)]
*  off the street. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=406.26s)]
*  That's the goal. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=407.26s)]
*  You said something that's very interesting. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=408.26s)]
*  You said that elected officials who are standing in the way like me, let's be clear, I'm not [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=409.26s)]
*  standing in the way. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=414.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm collaborating against so many others that don't want to collaborate. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=415.09999999999997s)]
*  Well now you're collaborating. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=418.73999999999995s)]
*  Like I said, go back to spring of 2022, I was saying we need to get dangerous people [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=420.98s)]
*  off our streets. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=428.66s)]
*  But it wasn't happening. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=429.66s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=431.98s)]
*  We dropped crime in this city at a remarkable level. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=432.98s)]
*  Did you help ICE? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=435.26s)]
*  In the level of enforcement for criminal actions, yes. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=437.34s)]
*  The law says, Eric, you cannot do it for civil enforcement. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=441.46s)]
*  But for criminal actions, yes. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=446.06s)]
*  The police department, we have increased the number of officers assigned to our task force. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=447.82s)]
*  Every morning we meet with our height of representatives in city, state and federal level. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=452.94s)]
*  Public safety, number one. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=458.5s)]
*  I've always pursued this. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=460.46s)]
*  Everyone knows that's what I'm saying. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=462.65999999999997s)]
*  Mr. Mayor, how are you, what is city council, what are they saying about you wanting to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=463.65999999999997s)]
*  change the wording? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=467.26s)]
*  Where we could go after the illegals, even if they're paying taxes, if they commit a [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=468.26s)]
*  crime. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=473.02s)]
*  Because we, I saw Vicki Palladino, I know she's a New York City Councilwoman. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=474.02s)]
*  She's a Republican. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=477.58000000000004s)]
*  And then Robert Holden is a moderate Democrat. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=478.58000000000004s)]
*  Both of them, if you were to talk to them about that change, they would tell you, we [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=481.98s)]
*  agree with Eric. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=485.82s)]
*  But the overwhelming number of council members who have made it clear that they're not going [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=487.44s)]
*  to modify that law. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=491.78000000000003s)]
*  I don't have- [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=493.14000000000004s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=494.14000000000004s)]
*  What is their reason? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=495.14000000000004s)]
*  Why would they protect the criminal? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=496.14000000000004s)]
*  Well, I think that you look at many of the policies that I put in place, put in my anti-gun [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=497.14000000000004s)]
*  union, 20,000 guns removed off the street, putting 1,000 cops back in the subway system [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=501.26s)]
*  to bring down crime. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=505.18s)]
*  All of these initiatives that I do around public safety, it's a constant fight with [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=506.38s)]
*  them because I think many people are articulating their personal reasons and not the feeling [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=511.06s)]
*  that the city has. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=515.5s)]
*  78% of New Yorkers stand with me, stand with what Tom is doing about getting these dangers [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=516.74s)]
*  in the streets. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=522.5s)]
*  But the problem is we don't know what the dangers are until they kill. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=523.5s)]
*  Like that guy that put this woman on fire because she fell asleep on the subway. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=525.34s)]
*  He didn't have a criminal, he didn't have a record. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=528.86s)]
*  But after he lit up the woman on fire, now he's a problem. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=531.02s)]
*  He didn't belong here. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=533.54s)]
*  Same thing with Laken Riley's killer who was housed here, went to Georgia and killed. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=534.78s)]
*  So even though you say, well, we want to be open to people, we don't know these guys are [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=538.9s)]
*  criminals until they act and then it's too late. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=542.42s)]
*  Then they become a problem. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=544.62s)]
*  But if they never got here, there wouldn't be a problem. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=545.62s)]
*  And that's what's good about what we're doing right now, what Tom, the Borders are, has [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=548.38s)]
*  done. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=553.3399999999999s)]
*  I've said it over and over again, we need to control our borders and not allow people [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=554.3399999999999s)]
*  to come into the country, gang members coming into the country, people who are here to commit [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=558.62s)]
*  crime. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=563.98s)]
*  I think what we've witnessed the Borders are has has done. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=564.98s)]
*  We have seen a substantial decrease in that flow. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=568.9000000000001s)]
*  Tom, you know, the NYPD, how frustrated are they that they can't fully have your back, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=571.22s)]
*  be able to tell people, tell them exactly where these guys are, be able to go into these [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=577.3000000000001s)]
*  raids with you? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=582.0200000000001s)]
*  Oh, they're frustrated. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=583.0200000000001s)]
*  I mean, the NYPD wants to protect your streets, too, and they and they want to enforce the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=584.0200000000001s)]
*  law and they want to collaborate with us. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=589.0600000000001s)]
*  I don't think I met a single uniform in the four years I've been come to the studio to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=590.8199999999999s)]
*  sit out front. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=594.9399999999999s)]
*  I shake everyone their hands. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=595.9399999999999s)]
*  We had dinner with officers last night, not only from NYPD, we had dinner with officers [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=598.1s)]
*  from Newark and from Philadelphia. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=603.02s)]
*  We had a whole table full of officers that want to do the right thing. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=606.3399999999999s)]
*  They want to collaborate with us. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=608.6999999999999s)]
*  But I think I think yesterday's meeting, I came to New York City, I wasn't going to leave [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=610.4399999999999s)]
*  out nothing. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=614.14s)]
*  I did the last time and I told them I'm not leaving until I got something. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=615.14s)]
*  We got back into Rikers, that's huge. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=619.14s)]
*  But we got other things we're working on. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=621.98s)]
*  So I'm hoping and now I got him on the couch in front of millions of people. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=623.22s)]
*  He can't back wave in this now, right? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=626.14s)]
*  So I think you want to see things move in the right direction. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=627.9s)]
*  I really, truly believe that. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=632.18s)]
*  We don't want to skip the false impression that there's no collaboration around criminal [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=633.18s)]
*  justice. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=636.9399999999999s)]
*  We collaborated with ICE to take down a very dangerous gang member who was trying to put [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=637.9399999999999s)]
*  grenades, grenades in our city, caught with a gun. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=643.02s)]
*  So there's real collaboration with Haida, our criminal justice apparatus on the city, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=646.18s)]
*  state and federal level. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=652.0999999999999s)]
*  We want ICE to come and be a part of that meeting as well. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=653.18s)]
*  Well, Mayor, let's talk a little bit about, you've been in the news all week. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=655.38s)]
*  The Department of Justice dropped the criminal corruption charges against you. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=660.18s)]
*  The U.S. attorney here in New York City, the Southern District, she quit yesterday, the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=666.5799999999999s)]
*  acting U.S. attorney. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=671.14s)]
*  And so did five members of the Department of Justice because they felt like being forced [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=673.02s)]
*  by the Department of Justice to drop the corruption charges was inappropriate and they should [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=677.5s)]
*  not have asked. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=683.02s)]
*  And what she said was she said you offered to help with the migration problem and the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=684.02s)]
*  immigration agenda in exchange for the case being dropped. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=691.54s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=695.62s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=696.62s)]
*  My attorney, Alex Spira, one of the top trial attorneys in the country, imagine him going [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=697.78s)]
*  inside saying that the only way Mayor Adams is going to assist in immigration, which I [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=705.74s)]
*  was calling for since 2022, is if you drop the charges. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=713.1s)]
*  That's quite per crawl. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=716.94s)]
*  That's a crime. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=717.94s)]
*  It took her three weeks to report in front of her a criminal action. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=718.94s)]
*  Come on, this is silly. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=724.34s)]
*  Right after. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=725.34s)]
*  He said that they said when they dropped the charges, it's not because we think he's innocent. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=726.34s)]
*  It says we think it affects elections. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=732.62s)]
*  It's going to affect his reelection and we think that that was wrong. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=734.94s)]
*  I'm sorry, who said that? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=738.14s)]
*  When the Department of Justice dropped the charges, they said it's not because they think [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=739.14s)]
*  the charges were unjust or that you're innocent, but they were doing it because with the charges [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=742.94s)]
*  they feel affected in an election. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=748.38s)]
*  No, go deeper into what they wrote. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=750.34s)]
*  They articulated exactly weaponization. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=752.66s)]
*  When you looked at leg room turning into bribery because I asked for a governmental entity [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=756.54s)]
*  to do a building inspection, we need to be clear on the root of all of this and a of [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=762.66s)]
*  the Turkish embassy. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=768.6999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=770.74s)]
*  The, you know, main justice, I learned so much through this whole process. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=771.74s)]
*  They review cases to determine moving forward or not. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=776.14s)]
*  As my attorney articulated, look at the heart of what I was being charged with as the mayor. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=779.3s)]
*  I was the president at the time. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=785.54s)]
*  Not say pass someone. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=787.62s)]
*  Can you do an inspection? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=789.62s)]
*  And Tom, you're friends with the president. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=790.9799999999999s)]
*  Obviously you came out of retirement, what, twice to go work for him and not making nearly [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=792.2199999999999s)]
*  as much money. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=796.9599999999999s)]
*  Hope your wife's okay with that. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=797.9599999999999s)]
*  But we appreciate you because you're fighting for this country and keep it up. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=798.9599999999999s)]
*  But you talked to the president. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=802.3399999999999s)]
*  The president was asked if this was quid pro quo, if he had anything to do with it. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=803.3399999999999s)]
*  And he said he didn't. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=807.2199999999999s)]
*  No, I believe the president and look, the president's doing a great job. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=808.62s)]
*  I want to say this, look, I work for six presidents. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=814.38s)]
*  I think president Trump's the greatest president in my lifetime. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=817.14s)]
*  He proves it every day. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=819.58s)]
*  Every day he proves to me why he is the greatest president in my lifetime. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=821.5s)]
*  Border numbers are down over 90% in three weeks. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=825.34s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=827.98s)]
*  You know, I worked hard at it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=828.98s)]
*  You know, Kristi Nolans working hard at it. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=830.38s)]
*  You know, the border, the chief of trolleys working hard at it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=831.82s)]
*  But it was president Trump's executive orders that was a game changer, right? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=836.02s)]
*  And we already got over almost 16,000 people we arrested in the interior. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=839.42s)]
*  That's three times more than Joe Biden had a year from now. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=843.98s)]
*  But it's not enough. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=846.26s)]
*  We got to do more. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=847.26s)]
*  But president Trump's leadership, when you get 90% less people coming across the border, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=848.26s)]
*  how many women aren't being raped by the cartels? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=854.34s)]
*  How many children aren't drowning? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=856.38s)]
*  How many women and children aren't being sex trafficked in this country? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=857.9s)]
*  President Trump's a game changer. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=860.48s)]
*  And every day, I'll say it a hundred times, every day he proves to me why he's the greatest [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=862.46s)]
*  president in my lifetime. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=866.62s)]
*  And you know, Tom, one of the reasons, in addition to not interfering with your election, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=867.62s)]
*  one of the other things was they needed you to essentially assist Tom with the migration [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=873.1800000000001s)]
*  problem here in New York City. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=878.38s)]
*  And what does that look like? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=881.02s)]
*  People didn't understand what that looks like. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=882.4200000000001s)]
*  What that looks like, as I say, every morning we meet with hideouts. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=885.62s)]
*  Federal, state, the city, law enforcement agencies. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=889.5400000000001s)]
*  Which we now have a seat at the table on that. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=892.2199999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=893.78s)]
*  That was another thing we both agree on. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=894.78s)]
*  And that's good because, as you know, Mayor, the way this particular case is being handled [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=895.78s)]
*  right now, they can refile the charges at any time. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=900.9s)]
*  If you don't help them, they could refile the charges. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=904.52s)]
*  And we- [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=907.5799999999999s)]
*  That's not what they said. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=908.5799999999999s)]
*  That's not what they- [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=909.5799999999999s)]
*  They can refile the charges. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=910.5799999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=911.5799999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=912.5799999999999s)]
*  First of all, I don't get into the legalese. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=913.5799999999999s)]
*  I have an attorney to do that. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=915.0999999999999s)]
*  And I pay a lot for that. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=916.3s)]
*  We need to be clear on, if the mayor of the city of New York is unable to collaborate, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=918.0200000000001s)]
*  deal with intelligence information, sit down with my state and federal agencies, and sit [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=923.1s)]
*  down to coordinate for public safety, we're still under the terrorist threat. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=927.0200000000001s)]
*  We still have illegal gangs in our community that's bringing about destruction that ICE [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=930.4200000000001s)]
*  is attempting to weed out. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=934.34s)]
*  If I can't coordinate that, that's a public safety issue. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=936.1s)]
*  And we should put public safety first. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=939.62s)]
*  Governor Hokel said last night with Rachel Maddow that she would consider removing you. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=941.14s)]
*  How would you feel about that? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=948.74s)]
*  She has her role, I have my role. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=951.14s)]
*  And throughout this entire ordeal, which I think no American should have to go through, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=952.98s)]
*  the torment of 15 months that my family and I had to endure for something I didn't do. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=957.9399999999999s)]
*  I didn't do anything wrong. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=962.26s)]
*  Throughout the entire ordeal, I said one thing. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=964.06s)]
*  My attorney will handle the legal part. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=966.18s)]
*  I'm going to handle running the city. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=968.78s)]
*  We return jobs to our city. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=970.6s)]
*  Our city is getting safer. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=972.16s)]
*  We're building housing. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=973.16s)]
*  I think that this is a great American narrative. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=974.64s)]
*  I stood focused on what I was elected to do. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=977.72s)]
*  I want you to address the... [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=979.88s)]
*  Governor Hokel is an embarrassment position she holds. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=980.88s)]
*  She stands on media after someone's burned alive on a subway. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=984.5600000000001s)]
*  She stands in front of a TV camera and says, I think criminal handling should be removed [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=987.52s)]
*  too. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=991.08s)]
*  But she's got the green light law. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=992.08s)]
*  The men and women of ICE and board patrol, when they pull a vehicle over, law enforcement, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=993.36s)]
*  you were in law enforcement your whole career. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=997.84s)]
*  What's the first thing you're going to do? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=999.2s)]
*  Run the license plate number. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1000.8000000000001s)]
*  Are these wanted? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1001.8000000000001s)]
*  Is there a warrant for these people? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1002.8000000000001s)]
*  Who are they? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1003.8000000000001s)]
*  Are they dangerous? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1004.8000000000001s)]
*  Is that car stolen? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1005.8000000000001s)]
*  All these things, right? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1006.8000000000001s)]
*  Do you know ICE and CBP can't run DMV data on New York State license plate? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1007.8000000000001s)]
*  So they're pulling on people not even know who the hell they are. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1011.4000000000001s)]
*  Is that the green light law? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1013.44s)]
*  The green light law. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1014.5200000000001s)]
*  So on one point she's saying, well, I think criminals should be removed too. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1015.5200000000001s)]
*  But then she locks us out of DMV data. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1018.6s)]
*  That'd be like us locking officers out of NCIC, the Fed zone. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1020.76s)]
*  Would we do that? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1023.88s)]
*  No, because officer safety is paramount. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1024.88s)]
*  She's putting the men and women of ICE at risk every day. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1027.0800000000002s)]
*  The jobs are dangerous. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1029.7s)]
*  So Governor Hocker, she needs to be removed. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1030.7s)]
*  Everybody needs to be removed. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1032.74s)]
*  It needs to be her. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1033.74s)]
*  She supports sanctuary policies. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1034.74s)]
*  I don't know anyone who thinks she's doing a good job. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1035.74s)]
*  She's an embarrassment. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1037.9s)]
*  I'm sorry to be impartial on that. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1038.9s)]
*  Mr. Mayor, thank you. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1040.42s)]
*  The migrant shelter, it's called a mega migrant shelter that's going to be built in the Bronx. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1041.7s)]
*  We interviewed a representative from the Bronx and he said he talks to everyone on the street. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1046.1000000000001s)]
*  Not one person wants that facility built. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1051.1000000000001s)]
*  What's the status on that? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1053.46s)]
*  Is there any way we can... [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1054.46s)]
*  That's great. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1055.46s)]
*  That's great. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1056.46s)]
*  You know what's interesting? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1057.46s)]
*  When I had 220,000 migrants here, anywhere in the city, and asked who would like a shelter [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1059.22s)]
*  there, not one elected would raise their hand. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1063.82s)]
*  And then you ask them the next question, how many of you went to Washington, D.C., under [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1065.74s)]
*  the previous administration and said you need to stop this? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1069.38s)]
*  I took 10 trips there. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1072.14s)]
*  So you cannot represent your concern merely from the sterilized environment of your office [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1073.6200000000001s)]
*  space. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1078.82s)]
*  They should have been with us saying we need to stop this flow and they weren't. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1079.82s)]
*  And so these shelters have to go somewhere. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1083.54s)]
*  How long is the federal government going to be paying for the Roosevelt Hotel or any of [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1086.78s)]
*  these other sanctuary hotels? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1090.7399999999998s)]
*  We're continuing to close them down because of the job that we did, 180,000 out of our [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1093.02s)]
*  system we closed down Floyd Biddenfield. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1097.26s)]
*  So one at a time you're closing them down? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1099.86s)]
*  No, more than one at a time. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1101.58s)]
*  We have to close down as the population decreased. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1103.34s)]
*  We put in place a 30 and 60 day plan. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1105.7399999999998s)]
*  No one can stay longer than that. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1108.82s)]
*  Well because you're a president that you were working for and worked for his re-election, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1109.82s)]
*  and he let that happen and didn't take your phone calls when you asked for help. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1115.54s)]
*  100% I agree. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1117.54s)]
*  He iced you out. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1118.54s)]
*  So you're going to have a decision made. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1119.54s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1120.54s)]
*  The days of the federal government paying the migrant centers are over. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1121.54s)]
*  Good. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1125.58s)]
*  So Mr. Mayor, you're going to run for re-election? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1126.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1128.8999999999999s)]
*  Are you considering running as a Republican? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1129.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to run on the Democratic line. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1131.1399999999999s)]
*  We've petitioned and started, starting soon, running as a Democrat. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1133.3799999999999s)]
*  There's many Democrats, like you look at those 78% that believe what we do with ICE is doing [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1138.6599999999999s)]
*  by getting dangerous people out. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1143.22s)]
*  I think that we have to get people out to vote. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1144.7s)]
*  That is the problem. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1147.3000000000002s)]
*  But you're losing by about 25 points to former Governor Cuomo who wants to be Mayor Cuomo. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1148.3000000000002s)]
*  Well listen to this. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1153.02s)]
*  I had another Andrew in my previous race. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1154.02s)]
*  He was beating me by double digits in February, but we don't call Andrew Yang mayor. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1156.7s)]
*  We call Eric Adams mayor. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1160.8200000000002s)]
*  Never give up. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1162.38s)]
*  New Yorkers, never give up. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1163.38s)]
*  People had me gone months ago, but you know what? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1165.88s)]
*  I'm sitting on your couch, couch talking to Foxy friends. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1168.5400000000002s)]
*  You are sitting today talking about the new alliance between ICE and Adams. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1170.1s)]
*  So thank you very much for coming. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1174.4599999999998s)]
*  Alliance was never severe. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1177.54s)]
*  And if he doesn't come through, I'll be back in New York City and we won't be sitting on [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1178.54s)]
*  the couch. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1185.74s)]
*  I'll be in his office, up his butt saying where the hell is the agreement we came to? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1186.74s)]
*  So I want ICE to deliver. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1190.8999999999999s)]
*  We're going to deliver for the safety of the people of this city. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1193.86s)]
*  Let's focus on every American and New Yorker should have the right to have an opportunity [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1197.26s)]

*  Hey, Tom, while you're right here, describe that meeting. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1238.0600000000002s)]
*  What was that meeting like? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1241.8600000000001s)]
*  Mayor Adams? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1242.8600000000001s)]

*  What was going on in that picture? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1248.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, we had my deputy mayor, Tiffany Raspberry, Intergovernmental Affairs, deputy mayor, Chauncey [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1250.18s)]
*  Pong, long time law enforcement expert. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1255.98s)]
*  He was explaining to us what are the various things that, as Tom stated. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1259.18s)]
*  What was the temperature in the room? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1263.54s)]
*  It was actually gorgeous. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1265.14s)]
*  I mean, Chauncey, never met the mayor before, but he's old school. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1266.54s)]
*  He was talking about things that I did back in the 80s when immigration was here in New [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1269.82s)]
*  York City. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1274.1s)]
*  So we actually, some of the ideas we came up with are old school ideas that Chauncey [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1275.1s)]
*  was aware of. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1278.98s)]
*  And we bring him up and say, how did you know about that? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1279.98s)]
*  I forgot about that. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1282.7s)]
*  Talk about your days at Studio 54. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1283.7s)]
*  Look, if anybody's got a seat cushion, I'll be real quiet. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1285.3s)]
*  Guys, thank you very much. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6gmUL-_9I&t=1289.42s)]
