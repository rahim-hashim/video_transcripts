# Dems could be handing a ‘loaded gun’ to Trump with the US's debt ceiling, rep warns
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU)
*  A Fox News alert. The government [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=0.0s)]
*  funding bill on its way to President [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=1.92s)]
*  Biden's desk after the Senate passed [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=4.18s)]
*  the measure just minutes past the deadline. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=6.26s)]
*  The stopgap measure still a sticking [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=8.76s)]
*  point with many Republicans as dozens [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=10.86s)]
*  of GOP lawmakers voted no despite [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=13.08s)]
*  multiple revisions, but our next guest [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=15.42s)]
*  voted in favor of the bill Republican [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=17.7s)]
*  Congressman Mike Lawler Congressman. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=20.3s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=22.12s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Peter. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=24.44s)]
*  So last night, Republican [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=26.6s)]
*  Republicans with the help of Democrats [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=28.4s)]
*  passed this bill that did not include [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=30.84s)]
*  Donald Trump's number one ask which [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=33.6s)]
*  was getting rid of or at least [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=35.94s)]
*  extending the debt ceiling. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=38.32s)]
*  Is that something that's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  going to happen soon? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=41.36s)]
*  Well, it's going to have to. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=44.0s)]
*  The debt ceiling limit is reached next year, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=46.32s)]
*  likely by about June, but look, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=49.64s)]
*  we're still in a divided government, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=52.08s)]
*  and I think people fail to recognize that, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  even though the focus has been on President Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=57.64s)]
*  Joe Biden is actually still the president, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  which is really mind boggling because [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=64.2s)]
*  nobody's heard from him in weeks. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=66.76s)]
*  And in fact, during this entire negotiation, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=69.0s)]
*  he was nowhere to be found. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=72.8s)]
*  Look, I believe like President Trump [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=75.08s)]
*  that the debt ceiling does need to be lifted. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=77.12s)]
*  This is not about future debt. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=80.0s)]
*  This is about previous debts incurred, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=82.36s)]
*  and we have to pay those debts and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=85.48s)]
*  every time you start paying the debts, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=87.48s)]
*  you run up against the limit. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  And so the debt limit, while I understand its purpose, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  the reality is we're one of the only countries [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=99.16s)]
*  in the world that actually has it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  It's been used as a political pinata for decades now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  The party in the minority uses it as leverage [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=109.4s)]
*  in a negotiation, and I think what President Trump [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=113.36s)]
*  is trying to avoid is giving Democrats a loaded gun [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=116.44s)]
*  to hold to his head here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=120.96s)]
*  We have a situation next year where Republicans [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=122.24s)]
*  will be in complete control of Washington, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=126.52s)]
*  and we have a lot of work to do, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=130.56s)]
*  especially through reconciliation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=132.0s)]
*  We have to get our appropriations work done, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=133.92s)]
*  and I think the president was trying to avoid Democrats [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=136.8s)]
*  being able to use that as a weapon. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=140.2s)]
*  Interestingly enough, Elizabeth Warren agrees with him. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=143.04s)]
*  She thinks the debt ceiling should be eliminated altogether. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=145.4s)]
*  So look, this is something we're gonna have to deal with [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=150.28s)]
*  in the new year. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=152.88s)]
*  I agree with my 34 or so colleagues that voted against [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=154.12s)]
*  the bill insofar as we have to reduce our debt. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=158.84s)]
*  We're at 36 trillion. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=162.96s)]
*  We have to bring down federal spending, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=165.08s)]
*  but we're gonna be best positioned to do that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  in the new year with Republican control of Washington, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  not right now in a divided government. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=175.0s)]
*  And a question about next year, Congressman. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=177.2s)]
*  To get this funding bill through [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=179.84s)]
*  and to avoid the government shutdown, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=182.2s)]
*  Speaker Johnson needed a lot of Democratic help. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=183.48s)]
*  When Kevin McCarthy did that, he got canned. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=187.0s)]
*  So in less than two weeks at the speaker vote, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=189.76s)]
*  is Johnson toast? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=192.04s)]
*  Well, I reiterate, removing Kevin McCarthy [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=195.16s)]
*  was the single stupidest thing I've ever seen in politics, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=198.72s)]
*  and really undermined our ability as a majority [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=202.8s)]
*  for the entirety of the 118th Congress. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=207.96s)]
*  Removing Mike Johnson would equally be as stupid. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=211.72s)]
*  And so you're gonna vote for Mike Johnson [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  in two weeks on the first ballot. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=216.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  Look, President Trump needs to have his election certified [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  on January 6th. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=224.16000000000003s)]
*  If you don't have a speaker, you can't certify the election. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=225.56s)]
*  So to throw a grenade into the speaker vote [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=229.92s)]
*  would disrupt the ability to certify the election [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=235.28s)]
*  and frankly get President Trump sworn in on January 20th. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=239.27999999999997s)]
*  We don't have the time nor the margin to do that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=242.88s)]
*  So we need to work together as a team. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=247.04s)]
*  I get people's frustration, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=249.11999999999998s)]
*  but let's focus on the work of the American people [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=251.04s)]
*  and put the petty grievances aside. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=253.76s)]
*  And to your point, no speaker can't certify the election [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=255.92s)]
*  in that case. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=259.12s)]
*  I saw somewhere if that happens, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=259.96s)]
*  then the president on inauguration day [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=262.04s)]
*  would be Chuck Grassley. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=263.64s)]
*  Thank you, Congressman Mike Lawler. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=265.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=268.72s)]
*  Merry Christmas, everyone. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lOyivxyrU&t=269.56s)]
