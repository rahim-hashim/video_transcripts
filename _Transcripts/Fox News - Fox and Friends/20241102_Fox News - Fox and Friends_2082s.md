# 'Beyond fake news': Trump goes off on new 'hoax' in 'Fox & Friends' interview
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI)
*  Well, we begin with a look at what's happening on the campaign trail. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=0.0s)]
*  Vice President Harris and former President Trump making stops in the South today as they [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  make their closing arguments. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=7.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democrats in the media, of course, smearing Trump over his comments about Liz [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=9.16s)]
*  Cheney. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=14.16s)]
*  And Aisha Hasney, she's joining us now from Gastonia, North Carolina with more. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=15.16s)]
*  Aisha? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=19.76s)]
*  Hey there, you guys. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=20.76s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=22.88s)]
*  A lot of folks already lining up here for the big Trump rally this morning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=23.88s)]
*  This afternoon, I should say here in North Carolina, the great state where more than [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=26.88s)]
*  half of the registered voters here have already voted early, either in person or mail in ballots. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=30.52s)]
*  The former president getting back into the campaign swing, trying to talk about policy. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Economy is the number one issue here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=41.28s)]
*  While Democrats and the Harris campaign are trying to hang on to this moment. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=48.44s)]
*  She's a radical war hawk. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=52.0s)]
*  OK? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=55.76s)]
*  You know, when the guns are trained on her face. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=57.64s)]
*  You know, they're all war hawks when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  oh, gee, we'll let's send let's send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=65.64s)]
*  But she's a stupid person. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=72.2s)]
*  And I used to have I have meetings with a lot of people, and she always wanted to go [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=73.72s)]
*  to war with people. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=79.6s)]
*  So that was a full sound bite for you to hear the whole context of what he was saying. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=82.76s)]
*  But Vice President Harris says that that should disqualify him from this race. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  He has increased his violent rhetoric. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=94.76s)]
*  Donald Trump has about political opponents and in great detail in great detail suggested [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=97.96s)]
*  rifles should be trained on former Representative Liz Cheney. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=105.44s)]
*  This must be disqualifying. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=111.92s)]
*  The president, though, defending his comments, and I believe you've got him on the phone [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=115.84s)]
*  right now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=119.44s)]
*  So let's go back to you guys. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=120.44s)]
*  You are correct. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=121.72s)]
*  Thank you so much for that report. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=122.72s)]
*  So let's do that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=124.12s)]
*  Let's bring in Donald Trump, GOP presidential nominee, 45th president United States. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=125.12s)]
*  Mr. President, thanks for joining us on Fox and Friends Weekend. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=129.12s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=132.08s)]
*  It's good. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=133.08s)]
*  You heard that report. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=134.08s)]
*  You were listening. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=135.08s)]
*  It wouldn't be a campaign down to the end if it weren't for complete mischaracterizations, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=136.08s)]
*  whether it's CBS, you know, editing in answers and in this case, taking completely out of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=140.4s)]
*  context what you said about Liz Cheney on foreign policy and accusing you of wanting [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=145.16s)]
*  to execute her. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=148.58s)]
*  Well, it's a fake news and they're trying to make something out of it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=149.58s)]
*  And it's so biased to start off with. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=153.68s)]
*  And all I'm saying is she was a nutty war hawk. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, she wants to go to war with anybody that moves and lose a lot of people, lose [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=158.16s)]
*  a lot of soldiers, put the nation in trouble. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=163.32s)]
*  And there's nobody tougher than me when it comes to protecting our nation. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  But that doesn't mean you have to kill everybody every day. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=171.55999999999997s)]
*  And she was in that job just like her father. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  Her father got us into the Middle East. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  We spent nine trillion dollars. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  We ended up killing lots of people, including we lost a lot of people ourselves. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=180.76s)]
*  But we, you had, you had a post size. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=185.64s)]
*  We killed millions of people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  We spent nine trillion dollars. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, we got nothing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  We blew the place up and we left and we got nothing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=192.88s)]
*  We didn't keep the oil. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=196.2s)]
*  We didn't do anything. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=197.2s)]
*  So, you know, her father got rich doing that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=198.2s)]
*  And she's, she's probably worse than the father because she's not as smart. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=200.72s)]
*  President Trump, what you had to say the other day has been turned into it's been distorted. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  It's been, as you said, turned into fake news. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=212.6s)]
*  It's a lie. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=215.12s)]
*  And you can take a look at some of the headlines that's been put out there from the Drudge [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=216.12s)]
*  Report to the Washington Post to the New York Times. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  You know, you've talked about this in the past. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=222.56s)]
*  At least when it comes to the broadcast networks, they operate on a free spectrum. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=225.0s)]
*  In the public interest is the conditions under which they have access to a free spectrum. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  You filed defamation suits in the past. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  It seems there needs to be some accountability for this level. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=236.52s)]
*  It certainly isn't in the public interest. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=240.16s)]
*  But for this level of mischaracterization and lie, what could can be some form of accountability [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=242.32s)]
*  for the media? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=248.36s)]
*  Well, there is, it's a very hard thing to do. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=250.36s)]
*  But I think in the case of 60 minutes, 60 minutes actually asked her question. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=252.60000000000002s)]
*  She gave an answer, which is this is your vice president or Harris or Kamala, whatever [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=258.64s)]
*  you'd like to call her. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=264.48s)]
*  Nobody knows what to call it because most people don't even know who we're talking about. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=265.48s)]
*  But she gave an answer that was so bad and so incompetent that they decided to take the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=270.12s)]
*  answer out in its entirety and put a new answer in. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=275.76s)]
*  This was the most important question that she was asked and the most important interview [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=278.6s)]
*  in 60 minutes as part of the news organization of CBS. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=283.92s)]
*  So what happens is they took it out and they gave a new answer. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=287.72s)]
*  I said, Whoa, that's the first I've never seen that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=291.52s)]
*  So then we want to look at the whole interview and they wouldn't show it because how many [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=295.16s)]
*  questions did they do that with? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=298.4s)]
*  And so on behalf of the people, we sued 60 minutes and CBS and we think their license [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=300.76s)]
*  should be taken away. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=307.08s)]
*  I think it's the greatest breach. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=308.12s)]
*  I think it's the greatest insult to the American citizens. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=309.68s)]
*  Think of it. They ask her a question during an election, right up to the election. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=313.96s)]
*  And the question is that of a very stupid person. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=320.88s)]
*  That was her answer. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=326.12s)]
*  And it was so bad. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  And, you know, they use the word words out. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=328.91999999999996s)]
*  I hate it. I just don't think it's the place. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=330.64s)]
*  Yeah, there's something about it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  It's not good. It doesn't fit me. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=334.12s)]
*  But I'll tell you, they call it word salad. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=336.48s)]
*  It was just a series of words that weren't connected and there was something wrong with [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=338.8s)]
*  her. And they saw that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=343.68s)]
*  And so what they did is they took it out and they put a different answer, entirely [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=345.68s)]
*  different, OK, which was a better answer, you know, normal. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=350.52s)]
*  In other words, this was not a great answer, but it was an answer at least. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=353.88s)]
*  And they went with it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=357.48s)]
*  And that's what they broadcast. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=359.52s)]
*  I think it's the biggest scandal in broadcast history. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  What they did, nobody's ever heard of this before, where they take the answer and they [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  put another answer. So I sued them. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=368.20000000000005s)]
*  And we'll see how the suit turns out, because I think it's a terrible thing because our [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=370.6s)]
*  broadcasters have no value. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=374.44s)]
*  The media is so corrupt in our country. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=375.92s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=379.16s)]
*  Are you Mr. President, are you considering because they're turning what you had to say [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=380.68s)]
*  into a call to execute Liz Cheney. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=384.48s)]
*  Are you considering defamation suits against the media enterprises who are putting that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  out today? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=392.12s)]
*  Well, you know, the media is so dishonest and they put out so many false stories that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm not sure that we have enough lawyers in the country to answer. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=399.12s)]
*  There's so many false things. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=403.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, almost everything is there. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  They're 90 percent fake. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  And they put out answers and you guys know you understand it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=410.20000000000005s)]
*  You're legitimate and you have a fantastic show. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=413.16s)]
*  The chemistry in your show is unbelievable. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=416.0s)]
*  And I don't have to tell you because you know that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=418.12s)]
*  But the chemistry, the three of you are unbelievable. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=420.72s)]
*  So I congratulate you. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=423.24s)]
*  That's not easy to do. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=424.56s)]
*  But the news is so corrupt. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=426.24s)]
*  You know, fake. I came up with fake news many years ago and I think it's great. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm honored to have come up with it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=435.04s)]
*  But it's actually not strong enough. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=436.44s)]
*  It's beyond fake. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=438.48s)]
*  It's so corrupt. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  It's nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  So now I wouldn't think I would. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=443.52000000000004s)]
*  But you know what I was doing with her was very simple. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=445.72s)]
*  She was somebody that I met with in the White House, along with others. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=449.35999999999996s)]
*  She always wanted to go to war with anybody. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=452.84s)]
*  If somebody stepped one foot in the wrong direction, she'd like to blow them away. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  And so I call her Madame Tough Person. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=459.67999999999995s)]
*  I said, oh, she's such a tough one. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=463.44s)]
*  Oh, you know, jokingly, sarcastically, I'd say, oh, we have this tough one. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=465.2s)]
*  Every time I saw, I mean, literally, if there's if there was a drone that happened [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=469.12s)]
*  to fall down on our property, she'd say, we're going to war with Russia. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=473.47999999999996s)]
*  Let's start a new war with Russia. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=477.48s)]
*  So she was. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=479.36s)]
*  And by the way, those are tough people. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=480.72s)]
*  Those are stupid people. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=482.6s)]
*  OK. And she was always like, you know, pressing for war. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=484.08000000000004s)]
*  In fact, it's why I had a fallout. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=487.48s)]
*  I didn't want to deal with it too much because she was always like difficult, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=489.44s)]
*  but she was like a war hawk. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=493.16s)]
*  So what I was saying is this is a big shot thing. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=494.6s)]
*  She's got stuff. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=498.36s)]
*  Her father got us into war, killed millions of people. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  He pushing Bush around. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=502.68s)]
*  And, you know, father was one of the stupid guys like Bolton to, you know, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=504.44s)]
*  Bolton was a dummy. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=507.84s)]
*  And what happens is we don't need that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=509.32s)]
*  You know, I had no wars. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=512.12s)]
*  And yet we had the strongest country. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=513.6s)]
*  We were totally respected by China, by Russia, by everybody. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  But you don't have to kill people every day to do that. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=518.9599999999999s)]
*  I had no wars, but I rebuilt our military. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=521.4s)]
*  It was peace through strength. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=524.16s)]
*  And it was a beautiful thing. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=525.52s)]
*  But what I said about her is that a lot of times he's bullied. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=527.12s)]
*  She's a bully. He's a nice female bully. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  OK. And a lot of times these bullies, they're really weak people. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=532.7199999999999s)]
*  And all I said is, let's see how she does. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=536.1999999999999s)]
*  I said, put a gun in her hand and let her go out and let her face the enemy [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=538.7199999999999s)]
*  with a gun in her hand. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=543.0799999999999s)]
*  And they'll have nine people or 12 people or 100 people. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  I said, let's see how she stands up, because I say she wouldn't have the guts [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=548.4799999999999s)]
*  to do it. You know, you have a lot of these Washington people [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  and they sit there and they say, let's go to war here. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=556.56s)]
*  Let's they would start wars. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=558.76s)]
*  If I weren't here, I would have had wars all over the place. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=560.56s)]
*  I actually defeated ISIS. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=563.8s)]
*  I inherited that. But I didn't have any wars in 82 years. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=565.88s)]
*  I'm the only president. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=569.2399999999999s)]
*  And yet during my term, we were more respected. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=570.52s)]
*  I will tell you, President Xi and Putin and Kim Jong-un, all of them, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=572.88s)]
*  they respected me more than any other president for many years, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=576.68s)]
*  maybe centuries, if you want to know the truth. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=580.64s)]
*  Total respect. And they didn't know where I was coming from. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=582.88s)]
*  I took out hundreds of millions of dollars for our country from China, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=587.24s)]
*  hundreds of millions of taxes and tariffs. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=591.12s)]
*  And yet I had a very good relationship with presidents. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=593.7199999999999s)]
*  He couldn't have loved me, but we did. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=596.8399999999999s)]
*  We had a very good relationship. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=598.7199999999999s)]
*  I had a good relationship with everybody. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=600.3199999999999s)]
*  I can't convince the fake news. That's a good thing. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=602.28s)]
*  You know, when somebody like Russia, as an example, has [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=604.8399999999999s)]
*  one thousand five hundred nuclear weapons, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=608.4s)]
*  it's not bad when you get along with the head person. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=611.04s)]
*  I will tell you what, Russia never would have gone into Ukraine [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=613.8s)]
*  if I were president. Never. Not even a chance. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=616.52s)]
*  October 7th never would have happened because Iran was broke. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=619.6s)]
*  They had no money. October 7th with Israel never would have happened. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=622.64s)]
*  And the leaving of if you take a look, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=626.64s)]
*  the leaving of Afghanistan, the way we did it, it was so bad. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=631.04s)]
*  Leaving was good. I was all set up. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=635.72s)]
*  I was going to leave with dignity and strength. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=637.36s)]
*  Take all of our equipment. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=639.52s)]
*  They kept billions of dollars worth of equipment. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=640.72s)]
*  They displayed it two weeks ago in your show. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=644.12s)]
*  Going down a boulevard. Right now, we need smart people. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=646.52s)]
*  People like her get us in trouble. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=650.9599999999999s)]
*  Of course, billions of dollars kills millions of people. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=653.28s)]
*  And I say and I say she's a coward. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=656.92s)]
*  And I say a lot of people like that. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=658.88s)]
*  Those people, the bullies, we call them. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=660.72s)]
*  Those people are always cowards. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=663.04s)]
*  Yeah. Listen, I definitely think Warren Pisa is on the ballot. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=665.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think people appreciate you calling out the warmongers, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=668.1999999999999s)]
*  but also the fact that they made money off of that. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=670.88s)]
*  And I think people appreciate that. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=673.8399999999999s)]
*  I want to move to this because, you know, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=675.0s)]
*  I didn't think you could top the McDonald's troll. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=677.8s)]
*  But then you showed up to that rally in a garbage truck in Green Bay, Wisconsin. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=679.92s)]
*  And I think as you're closing this message, this campaign, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=685.64s)]
*  this this this campaign of yours yesterday at the rally in in Milwaukee, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=689.64s)]
*  you said you can't lead America if you don't love America [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=695.48s)]
*  and if you don't love Americans. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=700.4s)]
*  And so that's obviously a reference to the to the garbage comment [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=702.3199999999999s)]
*  and so many of the other comments against women saying, you know, that they, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=705.8s)]
*  you know, can't, you know, they're not strong enough or coming from some of her supporters. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=709.68s)]
*  So what's your closing message about your love for America? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=714.24s)]
*  Why are you doing this? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=717.76s)]
*  Because a lot of people are wondering that, you know, as you've taken bullets [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=718.48s)]
*  and so forth this summer. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=721.56s)]
*  Well, it's an interesting question. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=724.92s)]
*  I mean, a lot of people ask the combinations of that question. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=726.4s)]
*  I could have a very nice life. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=730.2s)]
*  I wouldn't have to be talking to you right now, which I actually love doing. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=732.2s)]
*  I could be on a beach someplace. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=735.6s)]
*  Those beautiful waves would be smacking me in the face with that nice salt water. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=737.04s)]
*  So nice. I could get it nice, beautiful tan. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=741.08s)]
*  My beautiful skin would be nice and can't tan. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=744.28s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=747.36s)]
*  I couldn't think of even doing it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=748.4399999999999s)]
*  I love what I'm doing because I'm saving the country. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=750.4s)]
*  Our country's in trouble. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=752.56s)]
*  We have two incompetent leaders, very incompetent. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=753.88s)]
*  He's incompetent. She's incompetent. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=757.04s)]
*  It's only a question of who's worse. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=758.72s)]
*  I believe she's actually worse than him, if you can believe it. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=760.52s)]
*  And she is doing a terrible job. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=763.36s)]
*  The world is laughing. I don't know. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=766.24s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a big deal. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=767.76s)]
*  Very big deal. Actually, it couldn't be worse timing for them. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=769.36s)]
*  So we came up, they came up with the worst jobs report. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=772.1600000000001s)]
*  You know, I would say in history almost. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=775.44s)]
*  But it goes back many years where 12000 jobs. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=777.9200000000001s)]
*  That's like for that's like for a little piece of a company. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=782.84s)]
*  12000 jobs were created. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=786.6s)]
*  100000 manufacturing jobs were lost. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=788.4s)]
*  150000 jobs were lost. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=791.8399999999999s)]
*  It's the worst. It's a depression type statement. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=794.8s)]
*  It was the worst statement I've seen in decades. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=797.76s)]
*  Just before the election. Think of it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=801.4s)]
*  They created through fraud. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=803.6s)]
*  They created 818000 fake jobs. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=806.3199999999999s)]
*  It had to be taken off the books and they wanted to do that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=811.24s)]
*  But they wanted to be able to quietly take it off the books after the election. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=814.5999999999999s)]
*  Think of that. They created 818000 fake jobs [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=818.4799999999999s)]
*  to make the numbers look better. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=824.64s)]
*  And a whistleblower blew the whistle and said they were fraud. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=826.9599999999999s)]
*  And then they, as you saw last night, if you saw my speech, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=832.0s)]
*  they created another 112000 fake jobs last month. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=835.04s)]
*  So almost a million fake jobs so that they look better. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=839.1199999999999s)]
*  And they were going to announce that they were fake. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=842.8000000000001s)]
*  They wouldn't announce it that way. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=845.48s)]
*  They would do it where they're taking back and they were going to take those jobs back [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=846.96s)]
*  after the election, announce it after. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=851.0400000000001s)]
*  But they didn't get through the election because a whistleblower blew the whistle. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=853.2s)]
*  I love that whistleblower, whoever that whistle because that whistleblower [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=856.64s)]
*  did a very good thing for the country. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=860.12s)]
*  And so they created almost a million jobs and had to take it back. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=862.0400000000001s)]
*  Anyway, their job numbers are so bad. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=865.96s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=870.28s)]
*  And you have an election coming up in three days, four days. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=871.56s)]
*  Think of it. And she should not be allowed. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=875.3199999999999s)]
*  Look, what do you like, Joe Biden or not? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=879.48s)]
*  I'm not a big fan. He got 14 million votes. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=882.16s)]
*  She got no votes. She had no votes. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=886.12s)]
*  And then they talk about I'm a threat to democracy. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=888.68s)]
*  They're a threat to democracy, a major threat. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=891.04s)]
*  And she I don't think she's qualified to run whatsoever. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=893.84s)]
*  And, you know, she likes to use my term. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=897.96s)]
*  I've been saying that she's not qualified to run. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=900.2s)]
*  Then all of a sudden she uses my term. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=902.2s)]
*  Every time I have a term like no tax on tips, three weeks later, they go no tax on tips. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=904.08s)]
*  But they only said it a couple of times because they don't mean it. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=909.72s)]
*  I mean it. Big difference. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=911.96s)]
*  But they are running the worst campaign. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=913.68s)]
*  And I think we're leading by a lot. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=916.4s)]
*  I mean, we're going to have to see tomorrow. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=918.88s)]
*  Next day, we're going to see numbers that come fairly close. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=920.92s)]
*  But the big thing is for people to get out and vote because we have to turn our country around. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=923.8s)]
*  We are in a failing nation. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=931.24s)]
*  This is a failing nation. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=933.4399999999999s)]
*  This is a nation in decline and we can turn it around. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=934.64s)]
*  But we have to get out and vote. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=938.68s)]
*  But these people are very dishonest people and they should not be. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=940.6s)]
*  They almost should not be involved with government. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=944.56s)]
*  Mr. President, you know, all of us have been in diners across the country and there's so much always going on in the news. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=947.8s)]
*  But it always does come back to I made money under Trump or my money went further under Trump. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=952.32s)]
*  And now because of inflation and the economy writ large, I don't have this kind of opportunity. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=957.8000000000001s)]
*  I had you just talked about those job numbers, how they revised them for months. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=962.4000000000001s)]
*  Basically had to be honest about numbers that were inflated. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=966.32s)]
*  Now they come in at 12000 jobs. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=969.36s)]
*  That's not even that's barely good for a county, let alone a country. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=970.84s)]
*  Yet your critics will say, well, your tariffs are going to that you say are going to are going to crush our country and create influx. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=974.6800000000001s)]
*  What do you say to people that criticize your economic approach to how you bring prosperity back to the country? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=981.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, stupid people say that, Pete. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=986.76s)]
*  The most beautiful word in the dictionary is Tara. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=989.24s)]
*  Now, for purposes of your viewers, let me change it. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=993.72s)]
*  I'll say love and religion. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=996.1600000000001s)]
*  OK, and I'll make Tara the third most beautiful word. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=999.44s)]
*  The most beautiful word is that it's going to make us rich and we're going to tax companies if they don't build here. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1003.96s)]
*  In other words, if you don't build your plant in the United States, we're going to tariff your product because we don't want to really want your product. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1011.36s)]
*  If it's going to be made in Japan or China or someplace else, we really don't. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1018.48s)]
*  And I had that going good. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1022.88s)]
*  I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1024.3600000000001s)]
*  I took in a lot of money from other countries. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1026.92s)]
*  It was really rocking. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1028.8400000000001s)]
*  We and then we had an election that unfortunately didn't exactly go the right way. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1031.2s)]
*  But, you know, that whole thing, I won't talk about it because I want you people to keep your jobs. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1036.28s)]
*  OK, people are so afraid, you know, people are so afraid to talk about it. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1042.04s)]
*  You're not allowed to talk about an election. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1046.44s)]
*  So I won't do it. You three guys, if you lost your jobs, I would be the most. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1048.68s)]
*  Can you imagine? I cost those three people their jobs. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1053.44s)]
*  The worst. That would be the worst thing I think I've ever done in my entire life. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1056.32s)]
*  Anyway, there aren't too many like you. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1060.36s)]
*  We have to keep you around. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1062.52s)]
*  I won't talk about it, but look, it's we need tariffs. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1063.68s)]
*  They're going to bring in billions of dollars. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1067.68s)]
*  They're going to bring our budget. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1070.0800000000002s)]
*  They're going to bring us factories. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1071.5600000000002s)]
*  We're going to. Detroit will be a mecca. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1073.2s)]
*  Let me tell you one quick story. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1075.92s)]
*  They're going to build the largest plant anywhere in the world for autos, auto plant in Mexico, near the border. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1077.0400000000002s)]
*  It would have been bigger almost than all of Michigan. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1083.68s)]
*  Every plant, it would be supermodel, the largest. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1086.5200000000002s)]
*  And I'm sure you'd love to know that it was owned by China. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1089.4s)]
*  And it was all said a friend of mine who builds plants, he's one of the best in the world, maybe the best, probably the best. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1092.2s)]
*  I said, let me see a plant. He said, no, well, they're not here, but you can go to Mexico. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1097.72s)]
*  They're building big plants in Mexico. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1102.1200000000001s)]
*  So I said, I want to go to Mexico. I want to see it here. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1103.64s)]
*  He said, well, the only ones that you can see are in Mexico. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1106.16s)]
*  They're the big ones. I said, I'm not going to forget it. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1108.5600000000002s)]
*  But anyway, I thought about it. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1110.8400000000001s)]
*  Then I realized if they build that plant, Michigan is going to be wiped out. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1112.3600000000001s)]
*  All of Michigan, everything. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1116.04s)]
*  But Detroit is going to be totally wiped out. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1117.48s)]
*  And the smaller plants they have, they're all going to be closed up. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1120.12s)]
*  It's going to be a disaster. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1123.04s)]
*  So I announced that I was going to put tariffs on any cars made from that plant and any cars coming in from Mexico. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1124.56s)]
*  And I just did that. And it was interesting and didn't hear much about it. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1132.2s)]
*  And then yesterday, the other day, I said to my friend who builds the plants, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1136.96s)]
*  how's that plant coming along that you told me about a year ago? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1140.44s)]
*  Sure, they have decided not to go forward with the project. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1143.56s)]
*  Why? Because they think you're going to win the election. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1146.84s)]
*  And if you win the election, they know you're going to put tariffs on the plant and they're going to lose their shirt and they're not going to build it. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1149.24s)]
*  Think of that. I stopped the biggest plant in the world just by telling them, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1155.36s)]
*  you want to build a plant and hurt our country and destroy Michigan and hurt South Carolina and others. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1160.64s)]
*  At Doha, Tennessee, we have a lot of areas that build cars. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1166.48s)]
*  But Michigan in particular would have been hurt. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1170.1200000000001s)]
*  It was aimed at Michigan, literally aimed at Michigan. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1172.44s)]
*  They wanted to destroy Michigan. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1175.72s)]
*  And I did my tariff thing. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1177.72s)]
*  And without even being president, I stopped the largest plant anywhere in the world. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1179.32s)]
*  It was going to be so big. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1185.04s)]
*  They were going to rip us really big league, sell them right into our country. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1186.32s)]
*  And we would not have been able to compete. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1190.68s)]
*  Now, I said to them, I told my friend, go back to them and tell them, we'd love to have you build your plant, but only if you build it in the United States of America. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1193.56s)]
*  And you know what? I wouldn't be surprised if they came and we built it in Detroit or someplace. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1202.72s)]
*  So this is what you have to, you know, this is a real policy. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1206.8400000000001s)]
*  That's why people like me. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1211.4s)]
*  That's why people like me. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1213.04s)]
*  But when you see how stupid these trade deals are that people have made over the years with the two bit and I trade, I change a lot of them. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1214.28s)]
*  And just to finish, you know, I watch Kamala say, we're going to do this and we're going to do that. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1221.3600000000001s)]
*  And she's the worst ever on the border. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1228.28s)]
*  And Border Patrol endorsed me, you know, with the best. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1232.04s)]
*  They say he's the greatest president we've ever had. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1234.32s)]
*  We give him full endorsement. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1236.84s)]
*  And they said she is the worst of everybody we've ever dealt with. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1238.12s)]
*  She's the most incompetent. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1241.9199999999998s)]
*  She's the worst. They actually said that. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1243.1599999999999s)]
*  I said, that's the greatest endorsement I've ever had. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1245.3999999999999s)]
*  By the way, Elon Musk endorsed me. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1248.12s)]
*  Kennedy endorsed. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1250.04s)]
*  Everybody's almost everybody's endorsed me. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1251.04s)]
*  And if I don't win, our country is in really big trouble because you see those numbers that came out yesterday and those numbers are. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1254.24s)]
*  The worst I've ever seen. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1264.4399999999998s)]
*  And it's going to get much worse than that. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1266.3999999999999s)]
*  And the only thing worse than that is a depression like in 1929. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1269.12s)]
*  And that's where we're headed if I don't win. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1273.04s)]
*  So, you know, and I just want to thank you guys. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1275.0s)]
*  You've been so great on the Cheney thing. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1278.28s)]
*  It's a media. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1280.9199999999998s)]
*  I call it a media hoax. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1281.76s)]
*  I said, oh, we have another media hoax. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1283.0s)]
*  Well, they had another one. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1284.8s)]
*  So we had the biggest day ever. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1286.3999999999999s)]
*  Madison Square Garden said in the history of Madison Square Garden, Jim Dolan told me this. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1289.0s)]
*  The owner, he said, did a great job. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1293.92s)]
*  We had Madison Square Garden filled to the rafters. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1296.3600000000001s)]
*  But more importantly, we could have filled it up 10 times. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1300.3200000000002s)]
*  The people that love to the love. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1303.72s)]
*  It went all the way down to the Hudson River. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1306.64s)]
*  Most viewers don't know what that means, but that means blocks away. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1308.72s)]
*  Massive groups of people. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1313.96s)]
*  They couldn't even get near the garden. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1315.56s)]
*  People from Madison Square Garden told me they've never seen anything like it in the [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1317.92s)]
*  history of Madison Square Garden. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1322.92s)]
*  There was love and it was a great time. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1324.48s)]
*  And by the way, totally peaceful. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1326.64s)]
*  There were no riots. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1327.92s)]
*  They would know the police were great. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1328.88s)]
*  New York's finest. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1330.6s)]
*  But Madison Square Garden, it was unbelievable. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1332.0s)]
*  Well, I guess somebody put on a comedian and he joke, you know, as a comedian, he [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1335.08s)]
*  joke, he mentioned Puerto Rico. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1338.72s)]
*  All of a sudden the Democrats and they are good at this stuff, by the way. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1341.24s)]
*  That's the only thing they're good at. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1345.08s)]
*  They're no good at policy. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1346.32s)]
*  They're no good at government. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1347.8799999999999s)]
*  They're good at other things. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1349.52s)]
*  They're very good at cheating. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1350.6799999999998s)]
*  But other than that, they're not good at anything. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1351.84s)]
*  So let me just tell you. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1354.04s)]
*  So they come up and a comedian put an early on the show as a filler in all fairness. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1355.0s)]
*  I guess he said some joke. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1361.52s)]
*  I haven't heard the joke, but he said some joke and he mentioned Puerto Rico. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1362.72s)]
*  All of a sudden they come out with something about Puerto Rico. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1366.04s)]
*  Nobody's been better to Puerto Rico than me. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1369.4399999999998s)]
*  I saved Puerto Rico when they had some of the worst hurricanes. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1372.12s)]
*  Really bad. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1376.52s)]
*  I brought in the hospital ship, the mercy. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1377.52s)]
*  I bought in this massive hospital ship. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1380.32s)]
*  I brought there's nobody in Puerto Ricans will tell you that nobody's done more for [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1382.36s)]
*  Puerto Rico than me. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1387.1599999999999s)]
*  They made this one comedian telling one little joke early in the show when nobody had [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1388.52s)]
*  even started going into the arena practically. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1393.28s)]
*  They made this comedian and they made the whole weekend and they they took out this [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1396.32s)]
*  gorgeous, unbelievable, patriotic evening and they sort of stained it a little bit by [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1401.68s)]
*  a comedian that I have no idea who he is. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1408.64s)]
*  He's a man that was put there by very good people and well-meaning people. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1410.8s)]
*  He mentioned Puerto Rico and they made it like a big deal. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1415.16s)]
*  These are professional people. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1418.1200000000001s)]
*  And I always say if they would use that genius, OK, because the genius for doing bad is [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1421.0s)]
*  quite good, actually, if they would use that to make America great again, we would have [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1427.28s)]
*  the greatest country. It would be so nice and everybody would love them. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1432.56s)]
*  It does it. It doesn't look like turning that comedian's joke into three days of a news [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1436.52s)]
*  cycle actually work. You know, the Hispanic polling, which we can show on the screen, is [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1442.0s)]
*  definitely trending in your direction versus Kamala Harris, the way that voters, Latino [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1446.08s)]
*  voters are looking to go. But speaking of demographics, by the way, Rachel and I were [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1451.84s)]
*  there at Madison Square Garden that night. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1455.28s)]
*  We saw firsthand the environment. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1457.2s)]
*  We saw firsthand the crowd. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1458.8s)]
*  They're looking at demographics, Mr. President. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1461.72s)]
*  They're looking at shaving off. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1463.88s)]
*  We talked about Latinos. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1465.16s)]
*  They're looking at women that, you know, Pete mentioned we were diners this week. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1466.6s)]
*  I was in Georgia, the diner, and women talked about the economy, which you were just [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1471.32s)]
*  talking about. But what they want to talk to women about is, I don't know, the [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1474.2s)]
*  handmaid's tale. They want to make them think they should be afraid of their husbands. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1478.68s)]
*  I want you to watch this ad that features Julia Roberts. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1482.3200000000002s)]
*  You can vote any way you want. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1487.96s)]
*  And no one will ever know. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1492.72s)]
*  Did you make the right choice? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1497.1200000000001s)]
*  Sure did, honey. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1498.4s)]
*  It's about women lying to their husbands that they're actually voting for Kamala. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1500.0400000000002s)]
*  Mark Cuban has suggested you don't surround yourself with strong, independent, intelligent [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1503.92s)]
*  women. What is your message to women? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1508.16s)]
*  Well, I know Mark very well. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1512.2s)]
*  He's a very insecure guy. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1513.88s)]
*  Can't hit a golf ball more than 50 yards. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1515.2s)]
*  He's weak physically and mentally, as far as I'm concerned. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1517.52s)]
*  But I've known him for a long time. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1520.16s)]
*  He would call me in the White House incessantly. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1522.2s)]
*  And finally, I just couldn't take his calls anymore. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1524.8400000000001s)]
*  And then he went over to the other side. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1527.1200000000001s)]
*  And he's a guy that wants publicity. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1529.16s)]
*  When he said that and, you know, he's totally retracted his statement like, you know, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1533.2s)]
*  weak people always do. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1537.0800000000002s)]
*  They retract their statements. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1538.2s)]
*  But he was hit by some of the strongest, not human beings, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1539.92s)]
*  women. He was hit by the strongest people that it wasn't men, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1544.8000000000002s)]
*  women. It was women. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1549.64s)]
*  He was hit by women that make men look like babies, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1551.52s)]
*  because you know, many of the women that I deal with and that I have, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1556.0400000000002s)]
*  and I could go over the list, but the list is long, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1561.24s)]
*  including the fact that I happened to be married to a rather strong woman who just [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1564.3200000000002s)]
*  right now is the number one bestseller in the whole wide world in her book, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1568.6000000000001s)]

*  I've given women chances to, I mean, I had Kelly Ann as the head of my [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1576.96s)]
*  2016 big victory. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1581.88s)]
*  Suzy Wiles is strong. You know, she's the daughter of Pat Summerall, right? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1585.16s)]
*  Good, good genetics there. And I have tremendously struggled. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1589.0s)]
*  In fact, I've been actually accused of the other. They said, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1593.72s)]
*  couldn't it be like, couldn't you get women that aren't as strong? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1596.56s)]
*  I have more problems the other way until Mark Cuban came along. But you know, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1600.2s)]
*  Mark, I'm so disappointed at Julia Roberts, because I look, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1603.6000000000001s)]
*  and she's going to look back on that and she's going to cringe that. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1607.0s)]
*  Did I really say that? It doesn't say much for her relationship, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1610.1200000000001s)]
*  but I'm sure she has a great relationship. But the wives and husbands, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1613.88s)]
*  I don't think that's the way they deal. I mean, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1618.24s)]
*  can you imagine a wife not telling a husband who she's voting for? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1620.08s)]
*  Do you ever hear anything like that? Even if you have a horrible, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1622.96s)]
*  if you had a bad relationship, you're going to tell your husband, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1626.0400000000002s)]
*  it's a ridiculous thing. So stupid. She's going to look back some days and say, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1629.1200000000001s)]
*  did I really make that? You know, they're into this thing. Look, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1633.4s)]
*  I'm running against the worst candidate probably ever put up by a major party. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1636.88s)]
*  She's grossly incompetent. She can't put two sentences together. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1641.0400000000002s)]
*  And you take a look at the 60 minute piece, seriously, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1645.96s)]
*  look at the answers she gave. And now we want to see, by the way, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1648.1200000000001s)]
*  whether or not they did that with other answers and they refused to give us the [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1651.4s)]
*  papers. So we should, you know, I'm doing it for the people, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1654.48s)]
*  but somebody has to do it. ABC is, I've always said, very corrupt. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1657.72s)]
*  They asked me during the debate, this guy, what's his name? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1662.8400000000001s)]
*  Asked me so many questions, just always questions. He said, no, crime is down. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1666.6000000000001s)]
*  I said, no, crime is up. Crime is down. I'm sorry. Crime is down. David Muir. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1671.76s)]
*  He said, crime is down. I said, what's wrong with you? Crime's not down. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1676.8400000000001s)]
*  Something. And he said, crime is down. Well, he shouldn't have done that. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1681.12s)]
*  One day later it was announced. Hey, I have some friends in government, I guess. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1685.48s)]
*  They announced the crime stats and crime was up 45%. Okay. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1688.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1693.44s)]
*  The news, I'll tell you what, to make America great, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1694.88s)]
*  you really do have to get the news shaped up because the news is an [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1698.0s)]
*  embarrassment to our country. And you look at the Washington Post, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1702.4s)]
*  it's going bust. You look at the New York Times, it's doing so badly, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1705.96s)]
*  but the Washington Post, everyone's quitting. It's leaving everyone. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1709.72s)]
*  It's like crazy what's going on there because they don't have credibility [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1713.2s)]
*  anymore. They have no credibility and the media has to have credibility. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1717.0800000000002s)]
*  And the media doesn't have, it doesn't have any credibility. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1722.24s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1725.6000000000001s)]
*  Your show has a lot of credibility, by the way. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1726.24s)]
*  President Trump, I want to ask you one last question before we go. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1728.64s)]
*  A lot of people don't know that the Harris campaign has spent 20 times more [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1731.68s)]
*  than your campaign on Hispanic media. And yet you are winning over Hispanics. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1736.56s)]
*  What's your message to them? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1742.4s)]
*  Why do you think you're resonating with them better than any other Republican [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1743.96s)]
*  president, really even surpassing George W. Bush? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1748.4s)]
*  Because I love Hispanics and I respect Hispanics and they're great people. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1753.6s)]
*  I mean, I happen to be talking to one right now, actually, but I love Hispanics. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1759.16s)]
*  I do. And I love you, Rachel. But the fact is they're great people. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1763.56s)]
*  They're very energetic, tremendous entrepreneurial skill. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1767.72s)]
*  I deal with Hispanics all the time. They can be tough as hell. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1771.36s)]
*  They have great entrepreneurial skill. I mean, they're just smart, good. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1774.48s)]
*  They love the country. You know, I, it's funny when I said you need a wall, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1780.12s)]
*  it turned out to be, you know, I built 571 miles of wall. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1784.8s)]
*  And you know, everyone said, you're going to lose the Spanish vote. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1789.72s)]
*  The Hispanic vote, it's gone. If you do that, don't build it. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1792.84s)]
*  Don't I say this or I have to do what's right. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1795.56s)]
*  You know, who wants the wall more than anybody, the Hispanics, because they get it. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1797.6399999999999s)]
*  They don't want to have people from prisons coming into our country like we do. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1802.08s)]
*  You know that we've taken in in the last three years under this, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1805.9199999999998s)]
*  these two failed people, we've taken in 13,099 convicted murderers. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1809.8s)]
*  Many of these people killed more than one person. Okay. They're in our country now. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1816.1999999999998s)]
*  They're in, they have emptied their jails and prisons and mental institutions and [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1821.24s)]
*  insane as salams. This is just degrees of the institution, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1827.24s)]
*  but they've emptied their jails, their prisons, their mental institutions, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1831.16s)]
*  their insane as salams. They emptied them into the United States of America, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1836.0800000000002s)]
*  thousands and thousands and thousands, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1841.04s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people are major criminals. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1843.4s)]
*  And who would do that unless you hate the country or are very stupid? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1847.92s)]
*  I mean, there's only two reasons. You hate the country or you're stupid. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1852.24s)]
*  And who would do that to our country? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1856.24s)]
*  And you know, you talk about inflation and you talk about the bad job numbers and [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1858.48s)]
*  all of that, the worst job. I'll tell you what, it is a gift to me. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1862.12s)]
*  I finally got a gift. I, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1865.96s)]
*  I'm running against two people that just put out the worst job numbers, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1868.8s)]
*  which is a big deal. The biggest deal economically, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1874.56s)]
*  the biggest thing that happened. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1877.04s)]
*  They came out five days before an election. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1879.04s)]
*  Think of that. I finally got a gift. Now I hope people realize how bad this is. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1883.48s)]
*  They're the worst numbers ever, but the Hispanic people are incredible people. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1888.1599999999999s)]
*  But I just thought I was shocked to see it because Fox never gives me good polls. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1892.56s)]
*  Never. They should get a new pollster because they're always wrong. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1896.44s)]
*  But I just saw a poll. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1899.6399999999999s)]
*  I assume it was a Fox poll where I'm leading with Hispanics. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1901.44s)]
*  If you go back and look at Mitt Romney, there's another real beauty, by the way, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1905.32s)]
*  go back and look at Mitt Romney and how, what, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1909.2s)]
*  what did he have like 5% of the Hispanic vote or something? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1911.1599999999999s)]
*  And they had me down at what 51 or something, 51, 52%. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1914.44s)]
*  I was substantially leading a Democrat with Hispanic voters. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1919.68s)]
*  And look at how well we're doing with the African American population. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1925.0s)]
*  But there is a number that's going to come up and they're trying to hold it [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1930.08s)]
*  till after the election. And that's unemployment for black people. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1933.36s)]
*  It is unbelievable what's happening to them. They are being decimated. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1937.72s)]
*  The millions of people you hear, and you don't read in the news. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1942.3999999999999s)]
*  They don't want to talk about it. They hide it, but they know it's coming. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1945.48s)]
*  But they're trying to hide it till after the election. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1948.6399999999999s)]
*  Black people in particular are losing their jobs to the migrants that are [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1951.28s)]
*  pouring into our country. And by the way, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1955.52s)]
*  the migrants are coming from all over the world, not just South America, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1957.76s)]

*  And the black people are losing their jobs. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1962.16s)]
*  People that have had a job for 20 years, good job, good people. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1966.16s)]
*  They have a house to have a mortgage on the house, all that they're being fired [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1969.84s)]
*  and being replaced with the people that are coming in, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1974.32s)]
*  the migrants coming in illegally into our country. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1977.4s)]
*  And the other thing is migrant crime. The migrant crime is massive. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1980.92s)]
*  And it's at a level of viciousness. It is so vicious. You see it. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1984.7600000000002s)]
*  I play it all the time. I play clips all the time. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=1988.64s)]

*  you should demand it because they have the numbers or they're very close to [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=2005.72s)]
*  having the numbers when those numbers come out. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QTDHMj4eWI&t=2009.1200000000001s)]
