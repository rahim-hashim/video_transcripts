# ‘DIVINE TIMING’: Priest says Pope Francis’ final farewell is a reminder of heaven’
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0)
*  Let's bring in Father Gerald Murray. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, Father, we've talked about this some this morning [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=2.4s)]
*  about sort of the divine timing of this week. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=6.08s)]
*  It's still, it's not even a week since Easter. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=9.68s)]
*  That's right. We're in the Easter Octave. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=14.64s)]
*  We celebrate Easter for one whole week. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  And yeah, the beauty of divine timing cannot be topped. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=18.56s)]
*  And how about that weather? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=22.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=24.48s)]
*  How about the crowds? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=25.12s)]
*  I mean, the beauty and the ceremonial reminds us of heaven, I think. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=26.479999999999997s)]
*  You know, that's part of why we have all this elaborate stuff. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=30.32s)]
*  You know, there's more to human life than simply ourselves. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=33.68s)]
*  And I think that was reflected in what we saw. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=36.4s)]
*  That's why God gave us nature, because it's really hard to screw. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  Beauty, exactly. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=39.92s)]
*  By the way, Dana, Father Murray is a regular guest on Fox Noticias. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=41.839999999999996s)]
*  He speaks Spanish. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=45.44s)]
*  Oh, see? I know. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Well, because actually I did want to ask about that, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=47.28s)]
*  because I know 160 foreign delegations were there. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=49.04s)]
*  And I'm curious about his home delegation, right, from Argentina. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  Which I've had a chance to visit. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=56.48s)]
*  But in South Africa, excuse me, in South America, writ large. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  And then you think about the church growing in Asia, growing in Africa. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=62.32s)]
*  And this is a real moment to refocus and center ourselves, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=66.96s)]
*  but also perhaps maybe the world. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=70.8s)]
*  Yes, you know, we talk about globalism. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=72.88s)]
*  Catholic Church invented globalism, you know, the universal church. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=74.96s)]
*  I don't think it's the same one that Calvin Schwab was thinking about. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=78.24s)]
*  No, no, it's not about controlling people and their money. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=81.44s)]
*  It's about giving people souls and unity with Jesus. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=84.08s)]
*  No, Dana, your point is excellent. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=87.2s)]
*  The church in Latin America, the church in Africa, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=89.28s)]
*  there's a lot of vibrancy because people there are not so overly sophisticated. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  You know, sometimes in our country, we think we got the money, the power. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=96.4s)]
*  You know, we're great. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, wait a minute, you know, we're all human beings. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  And in Latin America, there's a real sense of that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=103.68s)]
*  I lived in Ecuador for a couple of months to learn Spanish, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=106.16s)]
*  which was a great benefit. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  And the faith is simple. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=110.48s)]
*  You know, people get up, they go to church, they pray. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=111.68s)]
*  They say the rosary together. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=114.72s)]
*  No, this display today at St. Peter's was a reminder that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=115.92s)]
*  the faithful are what make the church so vibrant. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=120.24s)]
*  You know, the ordinary lay people come out. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=122.88s)]
*  How about all those Italian people, you know, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=124.56s)]
*  leaving their apartments and their homes to line the... [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=126.88s)]
*  I saw some kids sitting on the sidewalk. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=128.96s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=131.36s)]
*  You know, this is our papa, our father. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=132.16s)]
*  That's the message I got. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=134.48s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=136.24s)]
*  Well, thank you, Father. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=137.2s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=137.92s)]
*  You'll stick around and come back and join us. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=138.8s)]
*  I'll stick around, yeah. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hiNdHNct0&t=140.32s)]
