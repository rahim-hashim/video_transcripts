# Springfield, Ohio resident: We've been sounding the alarm for years
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc)
*  Vivek Ramaswamy will hold a town hall in Springfield, Ohio tonight to hear from the residents impacted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=0.0s)]
*  by the surge of illegal immigrants there. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=8.22s)]
*  As President Trump also teases a visit to the small town in the next few weeks, our [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=10.84s)]
*  next guest has been a Springfield resident for more than 30 years and she cannot secure [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=15.14s)]
*  a ticket for tonight's sold out event, but still has her concerns. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=21.2s)]
*  Diana Daniels joins us again. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=25.22s)]
*  Hey Diana. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=26.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=29.56s)]
*  So what do you, he's going there to hear from the residents. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=30.56s)]
*  What will the residents tell him tonight? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=32.64s)]
*  I'm hopeful that the residents will tell him to and put to rest the rumor or the word going [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=35.64s)]
*  around that the residents of Springfield are upset with the Haitians being here along a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  color line. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=51.4s)]
*  And I hope he puts to rest the fact that what we're dealing with is a social economic [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=53.56s)]
*  and a social cultural disparity between the two groups. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  And I think that's really essential despite the fact that we have 20,000 Haitians and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=64.8s)]
*  approximately 8,000 Hispanics that have come in since 2014. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=71.39999999999999s)]
*  This is an unprecedented number and of course it's going to cause difficulty. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=77.8s)]
*  The truth of the matter is the residents of Springfield have been sounding the alarm for [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  several years and I myself have been at City Commission for the past year every single [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=87.9s)]
*  Tuesday night sounding the alarm that your house is on fire and you better do something [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=92.38000000000001s)]
*  about it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=97.06s)]
*  And so we've come to this position. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=98.06s)]
*  The City Commission has never allowed us to actually have a seat at the table to have [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=100.86000000000001s)]
*  a meaningful conversation regarding the socioeconomic and social cultural differences. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=106.18s)]
*  We are always painted with the brush that we are to say the least racist and that could [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=111.66000000000001s)]
*  not be further from the truth. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=116.28s)]
*  Springfield has always been noted for having his close knit communities based along and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  my experience as a teacher has been it's not so much the color is the fact that everybody's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=124.08s)]
*  poor. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=129.2s)]
*  And so when you have a disparate number of. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=130.2s)]
*  Looks like we just lost her. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=137.6s)]
*  We interviewed her last week. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=138.68s)]
*  Steve had an excellent interview with her and she said that town is everyone's living [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=139.76s)]
*  paycheck to paycheck. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=143.24s)]
*  And she said the issue is the migrants are taking their jobs and and hurting with social [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=144.4s)]
*  services as well. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  If you want to go to the doctor's office you want to go to the hospital. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=150.45999999999998s)]
*  It's harder to get in. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=153.38s)]
*  And I think Diana you're back with us. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=154.38s)]
*  We lost you for a little bit. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  Thank you for joining us about this. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  You also told our producers that in order to get into the event tonight you can't get [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  a ticket. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=164.72s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=165.76s)]
*  Well what we've come to find out is as soon as the back and announced that he was coming [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=167.56s)]
*  to town and the tickets went on sale that a block of all left started buying up all [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=170.96s)]
*  the tickets in mass in order to prevent citizens or anyone else interested in coming to the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  town hall from participating. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=184.12s)]
*  Now we expected this to happen in some way shape or form because of the rhetoric that's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=186.6s)]
*  been circulating around and what we're hearing online from other communities that don't necessarily [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=190.76s)]
*  have any business being in our business. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  So we expected that something like this was going to happen of some form. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  And of course we had a protest last night as well. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  I suspect that we're going to have some some protesters out tonight. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=208.04s)]
*  I'm not going to go inside even if I was offered a ticket because I feel that my place is outside [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  interacting with the residents that I have been for the last year and particularly for [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=217.48s)]
*  the last month because of in the last month we've had three residents express that they've [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=221.72s)]
*  been forced out of their homes and we're dealing with finding a place for them so that they [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  don't become homeless. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=231.16s)]
*  And that's one of the issues of course is we haven't had it the lack of housing for [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=232.67999999999998s)]
*  residents and they're being forced out. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  So I anticipate there to be a little bit of shenanigans going on so to speak is going [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=240.28s)]
*  to get a little spicy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=245.2s)]
*  I think so. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=246.72s)]
*  I'm going to be outside. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=247.72s)]
*  I know what Rebecca is going to say. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=248.72s)]
*  I'm hopefully hoping that he brings down the temperature and how it gives us an opportunity [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  to voice our concerns and bring us together. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=257.84s)]
*  You said that Vivek is a smart man. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=258.84s)]
*  He can handle it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=259.84s)]
*  You have a tiny town. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=260.84s)]
*  Fifty eight thousand people live there and fifteen to twenty thousand migrants have moved [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=261.84s)]
*  in recently. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=267.12s)]
*  Diana, I wish you the best. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=268.12s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=270.12s)]
*  It's very tiring but Springfield is a strong town. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=271.12s)]
*  We're resilient people. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=275.0s)]
*  We are not a hateful people. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=277.68s)]
*  This is not about the Haitians. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=279.2s)]
*  It's about how it happened. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=282.84s)]
*  We're going to get to the bottom of it as you all know. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=283.92s)]
*  We do know you're a good American. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xu7uVHxWJc&t=286.6s)]
