# Laura: This could be the greatest comeback of all time
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM)
*  But I'm thrilled to be back in the city I love and thousands of proud, hardworking American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=0.0s)]
*  patriots, you're with me, we're all together. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=10.76s)]
*  We've always been together. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  And I'd like to begin by asking a very simple question. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=18.48s)]
*  Are you better off now than you were four years ago? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=24.1s)]
*  With your vote in this election you can show them once and for all that this nation does [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=29.8s)]
*  not belong to them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=34.04s)]
*  This nation belongs to you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  Foreign President Donald Trump rallying a huge crowd of supporters at New York City's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=41.92s)]
*  Madison Square Garden, the most famous arena in the world. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=45.36s)]
*  In a new Fox News op-ed, our next guest says Donald Trump's message echoes the populism [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=49.24s)]
*  shared by FDR and RR, Ronald Reagan. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=54.44s)]
*  And Ingram angle host Laura Ingram joins us now in the studio. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=59.12s)]
*  Great to see you here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  So good to be here with you guys. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=64.2s)]
*  I watch you every morning and I'm like, God, I used to be, I used to come all the time. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=65.2s)]
*  You did. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=68.16s)]
*  We were once a week. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=69.16s)]
*  Yeah, we used to turn our bikes around. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=70.16s)]
*  Yeah, thanks a lot. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=71.16s)]
*  I noticed that the refreshments in the green room were a little downsized. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=72.16s)]
*  So, must be tough times. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=75.12s)]
*  Well, let me ask you, was it, you were there? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=77.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=80.52s)]
*  What don't we know since we weren't there? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=81.52s)]
*  Well, I think it's funny, you know how you just get a vibe, the vibe about situations, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=83.8s)]
*  feel the energy, feel the energy in the room. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=88.96s)]
*  And that sometimes is overstated. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=91.08s)]
*  I don't think in this case it's overstated. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=92.88s)]
*  And seeing the lines of people as you were, you know, coming up to the arena and just [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=96.36s)]
*  three, four, five, sometimes ten deep on the streets. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=102.6s)]
*  There were a couple middle fingers along the way when you were, you know, either Uber or [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=105.63999999999999s)]
*  whatever, how you were getting there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  But the people in the room were really happy. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=112.08s)]
*  There was a happiness in there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=114.83999999999999s)]
*  And I think the press is like, oh, it was negative. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=118.91999999999999s)]
*  Does he think he's going to win? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=119.91999999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  You know, to your point, Laura, about how many people dressed in red in the mega hats. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  In New York City, sometimes it can be dangerous to your health to wear a mega hat. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=132.16s)]
*  And I think the days of kind of hiding who you're supporting is, they're over. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=133.16s)]
*  I mean, I think so. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=137.84s)]
*  Maybe on some college campuses, kids won't. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=139.2s)]
*  But I was at Texas A&M over the weekend. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=141.0s)]
*  There are a lot of Trump hats, Texas A&M. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=143.2s)]
*  I mean, it's a conservative place. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=146.0s)]
*  Welcome to Texas. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=147.4s)]
*  It's a conservative place. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=148.4s)]
*  But still, I mean, on college campuses, I think a lot of kids have been afraid, afraid [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=149.4s)]
*  to be who they are. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=152.96s)]
*  And whether you're supporting Kamala Harris or supporting Trump, you should be able to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=154.32s)]
*  say what you think. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  What is your read on the country at large? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  Because I mean, the elephant in the room is there's a lot of people that are fearful because [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=161.28s)]
*  of 2020. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=165.8s)]
*  The red wave didn't deliver. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=166.8s)]
*  Although we feel the momentum, what is your experience? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=168.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, everyone says cautiously optimistic. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  I think that's appropriate. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=174.12s)]
*  It's very tight in these swing states. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=176.24s)]
*  It tends to happen in elections where things tend to break late. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  And in this case, I think Butler rally, JD Vance, Trump at McDonald's and this, those [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  four events, I think were kind of a real inflection point, to use a cliche in these moments. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=188.68s)]
*  I think that kind of reset the race in a really, really profound way. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=195.24s)]
*  Half the country really loves Trump. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=200.56s)]
*  And I think half the country is, well, we don't like some of the way he says things. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=203.12s)]
*  I think most people know the country's we need a change. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=207.24s)]
*  We need a change. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=210.56s)]
*  There's an article in Axios and it talks about how the Harris campaign is snubbing [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=211.56s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=216.76s)]
*  He wants to be a part of the campaign and they keep telling him, we'll get back to you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=218.36s)]
*  We'll get back to you according to three sources, three people who talk to Axios. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=223.6s)]
*  Is it because he's a reminder of what we've been through over the last three and a half [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=227.2s)]
*  years that why she's trying to separate? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=230.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, well, she said she can't really think of anything she'd do differently. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=231.84s)]
*  And so when he shows up, it kind of confirms that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=235.4s)]
*  She's in between a rock and a hard place. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=238.32s)]
*  She can't really diss him and she can't really distance herself from him. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  So and she can't embrace him. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  So it's a very tough situation for her to be in, but it's one of her own making. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=249.12s)]
*  And they got our country into a ditch. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=254.84s)]
*  And Donald Trump, as he said last night, I'm going to get us out and we're going to have [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  a lot of fun doing it, which is what you want to hear. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=260.2s)]
*  We want to have fun. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=262.72s)]
*  I mean, it's hard work. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=263.72s)]
*  I think it's a tough situation for him to turn Washington around. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=265.04s)]
*  It's a beast and they will fight him every step of the way. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  His first line was echoed Ronald Reagan. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  He said, are you better off today than you were four years ago? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=273.20000000000005s)]
*  I remember when Reagan said it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=275.44000000000005s)]
*  You remember it's actually part of the message in your new op ed over at Fox News dot com. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  Yes, because I wanted to take that narrative back like, oh, it's a Nazi. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  It's the most ridiculous. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=285.6s)]
*  When you when you're going to Hitler and Nazism and the closing of your campaign, you know [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=286.6s)]
*  you're not in a good way. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=290.8s)]
*  Anything can happen because it's American politics. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=291.88s)]
*  But being there last night and talking to regular people, they're mostly from New Jersey, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=294.56s)]
*  some from New York, a lot of people from Long Island, my home state of Connecticut. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  There was a good representation there. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=303.56s)]
*  But these are people just like, gosh, this is ridiculous. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=305.32s)]
*  Everything is so expensive coming into the city. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=308.32s)]
*  You can't. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=310.56s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=311.56s)]
*  You know, a lot of it is to you don't really hear the word conservative. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=312.56s)]
*  You hear more common sense, common sense, pragmatism and also just loving this country. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=314.92s)]
*  You don't want to question people's patriotism. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=320.55999999999995s)]
*  But man, when you say the country is systemically racist, you know, when you say, you know, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=322.23999999999995s)]
*  you're standing on stolen land, I mean, people are like, look, this is America. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=325.79999999999995s)]
*  This is the last greatest hope on earth. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=329.96s)]
*  And if this thing goes down, I mean, the conversation about the rest of the world is going to get [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=332.0s)]
*  very academic very quickly. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=336.55999999999995s)]
*  There's going to be two things. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=337.55999999999995s)]
*  If Donald Trump is able to win, there'll be two things. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=338.55999999999995s)]
*  Who's going to be in his cabinet? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=341.23999999999995s)]
*  Intriguing. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=342.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=343.4s)]
*  The other thing is going to be what happens to the Democratic Party. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=344.4s)]
*  You're going to see the biggest implosion between the Obama camp, the Biden camp, what's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=345.92s)]
*  left of the Kamala Harris camp. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pADtIGNVCYM&t=350.6s)]
