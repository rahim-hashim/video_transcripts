# ‘UNBELIVEABLE’: DOGE reveals just how much illegal immigration is costing US taxpayers
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA)
*  Meanwhile, if you want to know how expensive it is to house illegal immigrants in this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=0.0s)]
*  city where we got 56,000 and have had over 700,000 pass through, look at these other [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  historic programs in our past that we've paid for and compare it to illegal immigration, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=9.36s)]
*  World War I, $334 billion, the Apollo program, $257 billion, space program overall, $157.7 [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=14.24s)]
*  billion, taxpayer costs for the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb, $30 billion, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=23.2s)]
*  the Paminot Canal is $15 billion, Hoover Dam $1 billion. Now compare that to illegal immigration [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=29.24s)]
*  in our country, $150 billion. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=36.8s)]
*  It's incredible. It's incredible. And this, you know, it doesn't even include what is [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=39.64s)]
*  happening in Texas, which we're not even talking about, we're talking about the feds. We're [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=45.04s)]
*  not even talking about what the state of Texas has to pay. We don't get reimbursed for it [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  because we have a surplus in our state. We don't have debt in our state. We've been [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=54.34s)]
*  paying to secure the border. If you go out to the border, there are no border agents [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=58.68s)]
*  that are there on the front line because they're processing. They can't do their job. Someone [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=64.36s)]
*  has to pay for that. So the state has been paying for that. This is unbelievable. That [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=69.52s)]
*  is so much money that we could be doing to get our vets that are homeless off the street, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=74.08s)]
*  people that are living in poverty, fix our schools. We got kids that can't even read [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=78.92s)]
*  them, but we're paying for all of this. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=82.36s)]
*  The number that is the real tell is the one in the upper right-hand corner. And this is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=86.24s)]
*  just for one year. Illegal migration has cost taxpayers $150 billion. In comparison, look, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=89.84s)]
*  that is about half the cost of all of World War I. And, you know, a fraction of the Apollo [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=97.44s)]
*  space program. It's just extraordinary. And that is one year, $150 billion. And that's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=105.36s)]
*  why we all feel it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=112.56s)]
*  That's why I love that Doge is bringing this public, because that's going to be their greatest [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=113.76s)]
*  asset. People say, well, what can they actually do? Well, they could actually coach President [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=117.44s)]
*  Trump and make their case for executive orders. They also could rally Congress, especially [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  Joni Ernst says, I'm going to work with you right away. I think some Democrats who want [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=126.68s)]
*  a future will feel the same way because right now they're reeling. And I think the fact [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  is that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy holding a press conference is going to be covered [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=134.52s)]
*  by all the networks. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=138.6s)]
*  Because the thing is to see your tax dollars being squandered like that in black and white, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=139.76s)]
*  to have it put out there like a cyber deal on Monday, oh, for just 150 billion more, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=143.72s)]
*  you could get World War I or you could get illegal immigration for a year. And to your [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  point, all that covers is the federal taxpayer dollars. It doesn't cover the fact that the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  emergency services budgets were absolutely blown within one month of the annual year. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=157.32s)]
*  It doesn't cover the lives lost at the hands. I mean, it is so traumatic for the American [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=162.0s)]
*  people and the thought that this ripple effect won't be generational. Finally, however, with [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=167.68s)]
*  the new sheriffs in town, the new bookkeepers in town with Elon and Vivek saying, look, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=171.4s)]
*  guys, we're holding up the tax receipts on the basis of what was such an opaque administration [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=175.4s)]
*  that we are currently in, by the way, for another 50 days. We don't want to give you [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=180.28s)]
*  any type of indication what your tax dollars are going to. Just think, what could we do [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=183.28s)]
*  with 150 billion dollars? We're spending it on that? Like Warren said, schools, safety. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  All that stuff. And instead, we've got the it's a mess. And everybody knows it's a mess. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=192.04s)]
*  However, if you were looking at the ex account of the House, Ways and Means Democrats, they [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=198.4s)]
*  posted something yesterday that was quite tone deaf. And they pretty much immediately [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  took it down. They said, and here we were thinking y'all couldn't afford eggs. And as [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  you can see, that's with a screenshot of a post by a journalist that said record air [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=216.44s)]
*  travel holiday shopping, busting record stock market at all time highs. The economy is the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=220.72s)]
*  worst ever. Some Pollyanna's wine. What they don't take into effect and into consideration [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=225.16s)]
*  is just the fact that it's tone deaf and people are hurting. And that's one of the reasons [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=233.12s)]
*  why they just lost the election. Well, this goes to the point of them making fun of voters. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=237.64s)]
*  I mean, they should have left it up. Leave it up. Don't be ashamed of it. You guys continue [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=242.36s)]
*  TV say, oh, they're uneducated voters. Those are the people we can't convince those type [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=247.88000000000002s)]
*  of people. Although the economy, you know, it's good. You know, inflation was just transit [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=252.44000000000003s)]
*  transitory. It's line after line telling voters they're not smart enough to understand their [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=257.72s)]
*  situation. And I think just be open with it. Don't try to hide it because the people already [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  know the condescending tone that they continue to use with the voter. They're not smart enough [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=269.6s)]
*  to understand how things work. Yes. And the irony, by the way, is that that reflected [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=274.6s)]
*  consumer optimism in the future. It was the fact that President Donald Trump is the president [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  elect. It's the fact that they have have now a refreshing administration white to look [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  forward to. That's in part what fosters consumers excitement and spending on Cyber Monday. It [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  wasn't the dread everyone's been feeling for the last four years. But I totally agree with [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=293.88s)]
*  you that the mocking the condescension that is rooted in this administration in the House [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=297.8s)]
*  stems. Leave it up, guys. We already know you don't need to hide it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSiBpRvWcoA&t=301.56s)]
