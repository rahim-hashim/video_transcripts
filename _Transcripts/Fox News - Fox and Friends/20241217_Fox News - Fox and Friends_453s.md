# HE'S BACK: Hosts react to Trump's one-hour Mar-a-Lago presser
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg)
*  All the tech giants now as of today are have either met with Donald Trump or are trying to meet with Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=0.0s)]
*  Because they've got business in the United States and they want to be on his good side. Keep in mind [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=7.92s)]
*  It was [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=13.68s)]
*  After he won in 2016. He had a meeting with all the tech giants [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=15.32s)]
*  But it was a very kind of one-sided me Jerry Baker writes about it today in the Wall Street Journal [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=20.44s)]
*  We'll give you a little more on that in a moment [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=25.76s)]
*  But back in 2016 it was you know [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=27.32s)]
*  Those people did not vote for Trump did not like him held him in contempt [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=29.76s)]
*  And now given the fact that he has won again by a large margin that a lot of people didn't see coming now [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=33.7s)]
*  They're all lining up as they are right there. There's Howard and the guy from Softbank yesterday down at Mar-a-Lago [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=40.96s)]
*  There they all want to be his pal [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Is mr. Trump? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=49.6s)]
*  I [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=51.6s)]
*  Did have a dinner with Tim Cook I [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=61.2s)]
*  had dinner with sort of almost all of them and the rest are coming and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=64.74000000000001s)]
*  This is one of the big differences. I think between we were talking about it before [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=70.12s)]
*  One of the big differences between the first term and the first term everybody was fighting me [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=75.0s)]
*  In this term everybody wants to be my friend. I don't know my personality changed or something, but I [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=80.26s)]
*  Had as you know, I had Sundar from Google [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=86.9s)]
*  But I also had Sergey and we do have Jeff Bezos Amazon coming in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=90.82s)]
*  Sometime during the week we would it was a great press conference. He covered a lot [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=96.06s)]
*  He answered a lot of questions [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=100.28s)]
*  we were sitting on the couch in this room in the studio for outnumbered and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=102.3s)]
*  He'd already been on during Harris's show her first show [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=106.94s)]
*  Starting at like quarter after the hour and it it was hit an hour and Kayleigh was on the couch with me [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=110.38s)]
*  And she was like he hit an hour that just seems just shows how good he is [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=115.9s)]
*  Because we never saw Biden taking questions and having an hour press conference, right? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=120.66s)]
*  And he talked about everything he talked about the drones the drone issues [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=125.44s)]
*  He said the government knows what's happening. The military knows where they took off [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=129.32s)]
*  He talked about Eric Adams our mayor here in New York City consider pardoning him for the bribery and fraud charges the Postal Service [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=132.98s)]
*  They someone asked would he make it private and he said that's not the worst idea [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=139.78s)]
*  Laura Trump would got governor Ron DeSantis [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=144.14s)]
*  Would he appoint her if he becomes if he joins in the White House and he said that's not my choice [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=147.82s)]
*  That's his choice. Nothing to do with me. He talked about Ann Seltzer. Remember that the pollster sooner and he's suing her [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=154.2s)]
*  He hates to do that, but he but he will but he also wrote up tick-tock and he said, you know [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=161.06s)]
*  They helped me get the young vote. That's true. It's popular and the algorithm is it's cutting-edge and no one's been able to replicate [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=165.18s)]
*  All Instagram is getting close [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=171.22s)]
*  But the problem is the Chinese control it and we would never let the Chinese control a major news organization [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  And why would we but that's what it is that newsfeed for the next generation of Americans will be the newsfeed [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  And as the president United States as much as he's right [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=185.68s)]
*  He was very effective on tick-tock [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=188.4s)]
*  Is he gonna be happy with when his tariffs stories come out and have him look negatively or shadowbanned? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=189.64s)]
*  Is he gonna be happy with no positive stories about Taiwan? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  Is he gonna be happy about anything positive with that? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=198.2s)]
*  we might have a policy with South Korea or building up our defense or [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=202.12s)]
*  China's aggression when it comes to what they're doing in the South China Sea [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=207.2s)]
*  Everything's gonna be China's point of view. They don't just come out blatantly and say Taiwan sucks [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=211.44s)]
*  But they just make sure you see the pro China stories and you're not gonna see the Chinese walking with pocket protectors across the southern border [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=216.0s)]
*  Because they control the newsfeed. Yeah, why would we possibly allow that to be Chinese owned? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=223.52s)]
*  Well, you got Kevin O'Leary. Yes, there's some people that want to buy. Yeah, Frank McCord used to own the Dodgers [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  He bought the Dodgers from Rupert Murdoch. There is Kevin O'Leary. He's ready to buy it. They know it works [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  It just can't be American owned. There's no doubt about it. It works [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  It's effective and people like it but it actually is Chinese propaganda [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=242.64s)]
*  There's two things they spy on us and they manipulate us. Why would we play into it? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's it would be interesting to know what the guy who runs tick-tock said to mr [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=252.24s)]
*  Trump because I'm sure it's different than what they have said in perp in [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  In public the one thing so we heard you think it's different [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=261.0s)]
*  We weren't there we don't know my point is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=268.76s)]
*  Could right now Donald Trump what he said yesterday makes it sound like he is he says I got a warm spot for tick-tock [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=271.96s)]
*  Donald Trump is a genius when it comes to the American media and he knows that there are [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=279.79999999999995s)]
*  100 million Americans who use tick-tock a hundred million Americans use it right now [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=285.88s)]
*  so going forward, you know, it's supposed to the tick-tock deal supposed to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=291.88s)]
*  Culminate the day before he takes office he could turn that around then again, he could say, you know what? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=296.28s)]
*  Hasta la vista baby. Let's come up with something else. No. No, we can't be here [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=301.92s)]
*  You can only delay it a month because this is already past Congress [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=305.4s)]
*  So unless he's gonna go he's gonna go bring it to the Supreme Court [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=308.12s)]
*  Why would he bring something a Chinese own entity to the Supreme Court? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=311.2s)]
*  Let's especially when Mike Waltz and Mike Gallagher two people respects a lot no and Marco Rubio [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=315.0s)]
*  No, it's a spy device for China the solution would be to have an American buy it and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=320.68s)]
*  Make sure they go. Thank you. That's the legislation and and make sure that the Chinese can't spy on us anymore [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=327.16s)]
*  Take it over buy it that way the Chinese they get a lot of money for tick-tock and then everyone in America is happy [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=333.92s)]
*  Because China's not not spying on I think they did it with Grindr or some type of the Chinese [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=340.02s)]
*  Yeah, mmm [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=346.52s)]
*  I mentioned a moment ago [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=348.52s)]
*  I know either do I but I know it was a sale [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=350.68s)]
*  I I mentioned a moment ago Jerry Baker wrote a great op-ed in the Wall Street Journal where the headline is Trump is back [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=352.62s)]
*  This time without the disdain and it goes on to say [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=359.2s)]
*  Almost exactly eight years ago president-elect Trump hosted gathering at Trump Tower for the leaders of America's biggest tech companies [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=363.08s)]
*  Most of the people there the business people there had privately and occasionally publicly expressed their barely concealed contempt for the man [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=369.36s)]
*  Some had tried to stop from ever becoming president [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=376.88s)]
*  Mr. Trump seemed to crave approval from the corporate luminaries who had long looked down on him [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=380.2s)]
*  The dynamic suggested the tech leaders thought they could play him [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=386.02s)]
*  Contrast that with his encounters with Silicon Valley crowd in the past few weeks [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  They have all been forming an orderly [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=393.86s)]
*  Respectful line to bend the knee kiss the ring and slip the big check and the the big check is [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=396.76s)]
*  Absolutely important because so many of the tech companies this time around are donating a million dollars to his inaugural fund they gave [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=404.44s)]
*  They gave hundreds of thousand dollars to Joe Biden [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=412.64s)]
*  But this time around they're giving bigger checks so that he notices that because they want to be [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=415.28s)]
*  Any regulation that has to do with their businesses? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=421.84s)]
*  They want to be in the room or the last person Donald Trump talks to when it comes to that and one of the ways you [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=425.48s)]
*  Get into the room is you write a check. They're worried about our economy. They want to see America [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  Thrive again and get rid of all this inflation. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian kill me [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Uuelhewg&t=439.24s)]
