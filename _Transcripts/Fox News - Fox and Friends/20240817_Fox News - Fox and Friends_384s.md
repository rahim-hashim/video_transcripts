# Harris wants to resurrect the most disastrous economic policy, Asman says
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [August 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo)
*  As president, I will be laser focused on creating opportunities for the middle class. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=0.0s)]
*  Together we will build what I call an opportunity economy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  I will work to pass the first ever federal ban on price gauging on food. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=13.68s)]
*  As Vice President Kamala Harris promising to implement a federal ban on corporate price [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=21.52s)]
*  gouging to fight inflation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=26.2s)]
*  But history has shown us policies like this don't work. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=28.14s)]
*  Not just overseas, not just in Latin America, not just in the Soviet Union, but the United [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=31.28s)]
*  States. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=35.52s)]
*  Let's throw it back to the 1970s. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=36.52s)]
*  The time has come for decisive action. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=39.54s)]
*  Action that will break the vicious circle of spiraling prices and costs. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=43.02s)]
*  I am today ordering a freeze on all prices and wages throughout the United States for [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=46.92s)]
*  a period of 90 days. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  On August 15th, 1971, Nixon announced a 90-day hold on all prices and wages across the United [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=54.98s)]
*  States. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=63.699999999999996s)]
*  Interestingly, after this 90-day hold on everything, wages, every type of product and good, for [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=64.7s)]
*  90 days, inflation fell from 6% down to 3% over a two-year period. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=69.7s)]
*  But when the government eased off these restrictions, prices immediately shot back up. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=75.9s)]
*  This is in 1973. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=82.3s)]
*  So what did Nixon try to do? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=83.46s)]
*  Of course, put the freeze back in, put another restriction on prices of goods and wages, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=84.7s)]
*  stricter controls. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=91.9s)]
*  But this time, it's like a gas pedal that you hit too many times. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  It didn't work to control or tame inflation at that point in American history. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  That's America. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  That's the 1970s. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  Now, let's bring in Fox Business Anchor David Asch, who will walk through some of this history. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  David, great to see you this morning. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=111.62s)]
*  It's pretty shocking, actually. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=113.58s)]
*  When we listen to Kamala, we do think of Venezuela. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=115.26s)]
*  We do think of the Soviet Union. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=117.62s)]
*  It's pretty shocking, though, to go back in our own history and say, we've toyed with [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=119.58s)]
*  this kind of stuff. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=122.46s)]
*  And we can really analyze, did or did it not work with Nixon? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=124.06s)]
*  Well, nobody thinks that it works. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=128.38s)]
*  I mean, you have analysts on CNN. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=131.02s)]
*  You have the Washington Post. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=133.02s)]
*  You have the New York Times. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=134.02s)]
*  You have Jason Furman, who was a former Democrat. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=135.5s)]
*  He was in the White House informing Democrats about how to work economy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=139.02s)]
*  Two things happen when you use price controls. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=144.5s)]
*  First of all, you repress inflation. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=147.62s)]
*  It's like a boiling pot of water, and you put a lid on it and slam the lid on tight. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=150.34s)]
*  Eventually, it's going to explode. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=155.14s)]
*  That's exactly what happened in the 1970s after Nixon put this price controls on. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=156.89999999999998s)]
*  First of all, the reason he took them off, the price controls, is because it also creates [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=164.14s)]
*  shortages. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=168.22s)]
*  That's the second thing it does. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=169.5s)]
*  Because companies simply stop producing stuff that they can't make money on. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=172.06s)]
*  That's how the free market works. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=176.74s)]
*  You produce things that you can make money from. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  If you lose money every time you produce something because of price controls, you stop making [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=181.54000000000002s)]
*  it, and that leads to shortages. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=186.34s)]
*  We had shortages in the 70s on gas, these long, long gas lines. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  You had to wait four or five hours to get a tank of gas. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=193.74s)]
*  Everything that we put price controls on, we ended up with shortages. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=199.26s)]
*  Of course, we've seen it in Venezuela. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=202.38s)]
*  You saw it in the old Soviet Union. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=204.66s)]
*  When you finally take the price controls off, you have this boom, this explosion of inflation, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=207.14s)]
*  which we saw in the mid to late 70s. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=212.7s)]
*  That had to wait until Ronald Reagan came along to fix the problem, and he did. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=215.77999999999997s)]
*  She's trying to resurrect the most agreed upon disaster in economic policy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=221.42s)]
*  It just shows her ignorance of the way the economy works, the way businesses work. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=228.32s)]
*  The most fundamental thing about business is if you can't make money doing something, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  you stop doing it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=238.84s)]
*  You know, David, by the way, for anyone who's watching, and I know many that are watching [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=240.4s)]
*  or old enough to remember, but for anybody that's young enough not to remember, what [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=244.32s)]
*  David's describing are striking images, those gas lines, waiting four or five hours in the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=247.2s)]
*  1970s, seeing cars lined up down the street. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=252.0s)]
*  That's America. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  I almost feel like, David, I'd love to do another wall here to show this is actually [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=256.08s)]
*  the inevitable result. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=260.32s)]
*  These are dominoes falling. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=261.5s)]
*  In other words, if you institute a government policy of spending more than you have over [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=263.48s)]
*  an extended period of time, then you have to print money from the Federal Reserve. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=267.56s)]
*  Then you have inflation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  Then you have to raise interest rates from the Federal Reserve to try to tame inflation. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=273.52s)]
*  At some point, you arrive at the domino that she just knocked over, which is price controls. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=277.38s)]
*  You're projecting forward. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=282.76s)]
*  We know what comes after that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=284.16s)]
*  The next domino is shortages. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=285.5s)]
*  This is the chain of events we're headed down in America. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=288.22s)]
*  Well, the dumbest suggestion that she made yesterday, and presumably she's being advised [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=291.14s)]
*  by economists that are as dumb as she is in terms of their understanding of economics, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=298.02s)]
*  is the idea that rising prices are the cause of inflation. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=303.18s)]
*  They're not the cause of inflation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=306.82s)]
*  They're the result of inflation. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=308.7s)]
*  Inflation is created by too much money created by the government and too few goods because [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=311.26s)]
*  there are too many restrictions on producing things, whether that's a lot of regulations, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=316.74s)]
*  high taxes, whatever it is. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=322.65999999999997s)]
*  You have to either increase the supply of goods by tax, lowering tax rates and lowering [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=324.34s)]
*  regulations or by stopping printing so much money or best of all, do both, which is what [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=331.78s)]
*  Ronald Reagan did. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=338.14s)]
*  He had growth and a slowing down of inflation. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=339.46s)]
*  You don't need to have a recession in order to kill inflation. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=342.7s)]
*  You just need more supply of goods. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=346.06s)]
*  That's good for everybody. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=348.29999999999995s)]
*  It's good for the economy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=349.73999999999995s)]
*  It lowers the debt. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=351.14s)]
*  It does everything. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=352.56s)]
*  This is incredibly important analysis. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=353.78s)]
*  You can get more of this from David, by the way. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=355.41999999999996s)]
*  He's going to be today, three o'clock Eastern time, journal editorial report. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=357.53999999999996s)]
*  You can always get great economic analysis and it's never been more important than when [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=362.58s)]
*  you hear this type of proposal coming from a candidate for president. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=366.54s)]
*  David, great to see you. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=370.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=371.1s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=372.1s)]
*  Thanks for the plug. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=373.1s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGvq7j5esTo&t=374.1s)]
