# Los Angeles DA puts violent rioters on notice: 'They will get prosecuted'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM)
*  The violent anti-ice protesters showing no signs of letting up, protesting the arrests [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=0.0s)]
*  of illegal immigrants, perhaps including child abusers, murder suspect, assaults. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  And President Trump says he has had enough. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=21.0s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, hey, he's daring Tom Homey to come in arrest though. Should he do it? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=24.84s)]
*  I would do it if I were Tom. I think it's great that Gavin likes to publicity, but I think it would be a great thing. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=32.84s)]
*  He's done a terrible job. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=38.84s)]
*  LA County DA Nathan Hockman ran on restoring law and order when he won back in November. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=40.84s)]
*  He joins us now. Mr. District Attorney, thank you so much for joining the program. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=47.84s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=50.84s)]
*  All right. We only got a few minutes with you, but what is your reaction to the city being in chaos right now? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=52.84s)]
*  What went wrong? Because these ICE agents have federal warrants for criminals. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=58.84s)]
*  So what went wrong is that the, unfortunately, the federal agents when they executed the warrants, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=63.84s)]
*  did anticipate that there would be hundreds of people quite quickly descending on them. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=69.84s)]
*  The word got out very quickly. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=75.84s)]
*  They didn't have the perimeters established that they should have had. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=77.84s)]
*  And what quickly grew is a couple hundred people into a couple thousand people. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=82.84s)]
*  Well, what we've seen is that there are four million people in LA City. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=87.84s)]
*  There's 11 million people in LA County. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=91.84s)]
*  A small percentage of them have actually protested, and those are the legitimate protesters. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=93.84s)]
*  Then a smaller percentage broke off and they've committed a whole rash of crimes, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=98.84s)]
*  whether it's lighting way most on fire, shooting commercial grade fireworks at police officers, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=103.84s)]
*  not hurling insults at them, hurling actually cinder blocks and bricks at the police. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=108.84s)]
*  That's my job as the D.A. We will be prosecuting those folks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=113.84s)]
*  Law enforcement will arrest them. They will get prosecuted and they will be punished in accordance with the law. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=117.84s)]
*  So where's the mayor? Where's the governor here? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=123.84s)]
*  Do you think the mayor has done everything she could? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=127.84s)]
*  Do you believe the governor is doing everything he could? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=131.84s)]
*  And do you believe what they say? And the president's made it worse. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=134.84s)]
*  You know, it's interesting is that I'm not going to wade necessarily into the political waters here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=138.84s)]
*  That's not the job of the D.A. But ultimately it comes down to law enforcement. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=142.84s)]
*  Either the mayor or the governor can arrest a soul. They can't keep public safety in check. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=147.84s)]
*  That goes down to law enforcement. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=152.84s)]
*  But they could order the sheriff to be more active. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=154.84s)]
*  They could make sure that this doesn't get out of control. Did they do that? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=157.84s)]
*  Actually, the mayor has no power over law enforcement. Absolutely none. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=161.84s)]
*  The governor has very little other than calling in the National Guard. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=166.84s)]
*  And that's already been done for the governor. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=169.84s)]
*  Law enforcement has tens of thousands of law enforcement officers that it can enlist in helping going after the civil unrest. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=171.84s)]
*  I will say in the last couple of days, they've learned from the first day. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=179.84s)]
*  It's been getting a little bit better each day. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=183.84s)]
*  And law enforcement is doing a job literally 24 hours a day to get this situation under control. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=185.84s)]
*  Mr. District Attorney, I don't want to put you in a tough spot because I know you've got to work with these people on a day-to-day basis. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=190.84s)]
*  But I still got friends in L.A. that are in law enforcement. And they tell me that they're being handcuffed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=196.84s)]
*  Now, you say the mayor doesn't have responsibility. But the police chief is getting his orders from her. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=202.84s)]
*  So there's a miscalculation or communication going somewhere because his guys are responding to his leadership and he's responding to her. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=209.84s)]
*  So what's going on? I know you hear the same thing from the cops on the ground. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=219.84s)]
*  Right. From the cops on the ground, quite candidly, they're getting their responses from their leaders, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=224.84s)]
*  whether it's chief of LAPD Jim McDonald or the sheriff Robert Luna of LAPD Sheriff's Department. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=229.84s)]
*  They literally have the LAPD has over 8000 officers. The sheriff has over 10000 officers. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=235.84s)]
*  They're dealing with this civil unrest. And quite candidly, if the mayor, the governor and the president are having a political squabble above them, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=241.84s)]
*  that's not what they're dealing with on the ground. They're doing an incredible job on the ground. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=250.84s)]
*  And again, it started out difficult. Each day it seems to be getting better. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=254.84s)]
*  And then the DA's office is backing them and being their full partner in holding criminals accountable. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  Let me ask you, Nathan, real quick. If the ICE was able to communicate with the LAPD, how much smoother and safer would things be? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=264.84s)]
*  If they had been able to communicate from the beginning and they established that perimeter from the beginning, it would have been a lot better. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=273.84s)]
*  But they don't. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=280.84s)]
*  Part of the problem, yes, is that we do not have those smooth lines of communication between the federal immigration authorities and the local law enforcement officers. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=281.84s)]
*  And I just want to add, Mr. District Attorney, we appreciate you going on. It's not because ICE doesn't want to have a relationship with them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=293.84s)]
*  It's the locals that are saying that they can't. They didn't even respond to an officer assist call. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=299.84s)]
*  But Mr. District Attorney, we appreciate you joining the program. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlHLBotKXM&t=304.84s)]
