# AI at 'critical moment' as Vance joins tech leaders at Paris summit
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss)
*  All right. Artificial intelligence scoring the touchdown this Super Bowl Sunday with major companies like Meta, chat, GPT and Google promoting their AI products. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=0.0s)]
*  And on the field, it analyzed player performance, set betting lines and even predicted plays. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=9.68s)]
*  Here with more is scale AI CEO Alexander Wang. Alexander, good morning to you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=17.0s)]
*  So this is new. This emphasis on AI at the Super Bowl in so many different ways. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=22.44s)]
*  So what do you think about this? Is this a good thing? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=29.0s)]
*  You know, I've been working on AI for a long time since I was 19. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=32.32s)]
*  And so it's incredibly surreal to see AI become so mainstream, especially seeing it become such a big part of the game, as well as such a big part of the the commercials around it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=35.96s)]
*  I also thought it was really cool to see President Trump at the Super Bowl, the first sitting president ever attend the game, which is absolutely historic. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it certainly was. And right now you're coming to us from Paris because there's an AI summit that's going to take place very soon. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=54.08s)]
*  J.D. Vance is also there. He's going to be speaking at it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=61.28s)]
*  So how important is this summit and what do you expect to take place at it? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=64.36s)]
*  Yes, so so AI is at a critical moment right now, you know, to use a football analogy, I think we're still in the first quarter of AI progress. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=69.2s)]
*  We're just seeing the technology start to be used more and more in the world. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=76.68s)]
*  And I think this is a critical moment for the United States and Vice President Vance to really talk about the how America is going to lead. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=80.92s)]
*  You know, President Trump clearly understands the need to win the AI race, just like how earlier presidents were focused on winning the space race. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=89.6s)]
*  He's brought together great minds to work with him in the administration from the vice president to defense to commerce to the Office of Science and Technology and the AI and cryptos are, you know, they're all business minded and action oriented. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=97.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And it's been a topic of conversation that's come up a lot in the news lately, especially with the revelation of deep seek that Chinese AI company that can rival American products that are coming up coming out right now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  So you met with the Trump administration last week. What did you learn during those meetings? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=119.56s)]
*  And and also, why is it important for the United States to win when it comes to the AI race? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=124.44s)]
*  So absolutely, there is a race going on between the U.S. and China on AI. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=131.24s)]
*  And President Trump has directed his administration to achieve American AI dominance. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=136.52s)]
*  Just like we won the space race, we want to win the AI race. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=141.72s)]
*  You know, AI is ultimately really key to protecting American values and security. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=145.48s)]
*  For example, the U.S. military today is the strongest in the world and AI is how we stay there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=151.16s)]
*  So there's a huge opportunity for AI to be the the technology that enables the United States to stay in the lead economically, militarily and ensure that our values continue to be the ones that we're able to live with and not allow communist or totalitarian technologies like those from China start to take over the globe. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=156.76s)]
*  That's right. Military economy, now artificial intelligence. The future is now. And Alexander, you are all over it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=173.32s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us with your expertise this morning. We appreciate it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=179.56s)]
*  Thanks for having me. You're very welcome. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuNhfQt99ss&t=183.0s)]
