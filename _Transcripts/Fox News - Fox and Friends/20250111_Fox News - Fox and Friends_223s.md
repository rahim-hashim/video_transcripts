# Zuckerberg reveals Biden’s staff would ‘scream’ at employees, demand content removal
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08)
*  That's something Donald Trump talked about on the Joe Rogan experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  And then recently, Mark Zuckerberg from Metta was on the Joe Rogan experience. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  He was talking about the kind of pressure that he got, that Facebook got from the Biden [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=7.9s)]
*  administration to censor during COVID. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=19.48s)]
*  During the Biden administration, when they were trying to roll out the vaccine program, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=20.48s)]
*  while they're trying to push that program, they also tried to censor anyone who is basically [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=27.32s)]
*  arguing against it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=32.4s)]
*  And they pushed us super hard to take down things that were honestly true. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=33.7s)]
*  They basically pushed us and said, anything that says that vaccines might have side effects, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=40.88s)]
*  you basically need to take down. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=49.54s)]
*  And I was just like, well, we're not going to do that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=51.96s)]
*  We're clearly not going to do that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=55.88s)]
*  I mean, that is kind of inarguably true. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=56.92s)]
*  But he did. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=61.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=62.32s)]
*  And he's a weasel. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=63.32s)]
*  Just like everybody covering their you know what's in the fire situation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  This guy was weak. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=68.98s)]
*  And you know what's interesting when I was reading all this stuff about it? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=69.98s)]
*  Do you remember when people were talking about him being presidential timber? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=72.0s)]
*  Like he could run for president. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=76.08s)]
*  Remember this? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=77.08s)]
*  This is, oh yeah, oh yeah, there was a lot of talk about that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=78.08s)]
*  Like this guy, he's so brilliant. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=80.44s)]
*  He's weak. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=82.4s)]
*  And it's only now that all the tide has turned that he feels safe to say what he cooperated [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=83.44s)]
*  with the government to do, which was to censor you and stifle your first American right. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=89.72s)]
*  And he's crying like a little baby on a podcast because he got cursed at by somebody in the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=94.56s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=99.4s)]
*  Oh, my staff got yelled at. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=100.4s)]
*  And you didn't stand up for them. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=102.24s)]
*  No, I think you're 100 percent right. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  He's weak and he's going he's he's now bending to the new direction of the wind, which, by [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=105.8s)]
*  also includes Metta, Facebook's parent company, doing away with a lot of DEI stuff. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=111.2s)]
*  You know, they've taken tampons out of the men's restroom at Metta and they're doing [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=115.48s)]
*  away with what will we do? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  They're doing away with some DEI. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=122.16s)]
*  This is a memo leaked from Metta on hiring. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  We will continue to source candidates from different backgrounds, but we will stop using [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=127.0s)]
*  the diverse slate approach. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=130.4s)]
*  The practice always been has always been subject to public debate and is currently being challenged. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=132.12s)]
*  So they're doing away with DEI initiatives. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=137.48000000000002s)]
*  Also, not just for employees like you think, do you know, they're they're DEI to hire someone. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=139.64s)]
*  But they were also favoring contractors who were of different. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=145.72s)]
*  So it's it's it's it's much bigger than you think. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=149.92s)]
*  And they're saying we're going to start sourcing from any American who has the best price and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  the best deal as opposed to any company that, you know, run by a Hispanic or black person. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=158.88s)]
*  And it does it does breed incredible suspicion because then, you know, go back to the fires. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=165.04s)]
*  You look at these people and, you know, take the fire chief, for example, the first woman [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=169.92s)]
*  person that LGBTQ. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=174.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=177.04s)]
*  Anyway, whatever. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=178.04s)]
*  And so that but but the point is that, you know, maybe she's the greatest fire chief [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=179.4s)]
*  on earth. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=183.52s)]
*  But now that the city is burning to the ground, everybody is going, well, you know, obviously, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=184.52s)]
*  this was probably a DEI hire. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=189.0s)]
*  And it just breeds the suspicion. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=190.88s)]
*  Makes you like if you know, if you're Ben Carson and you're a brilliant surgeon, but [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  because you're black, you get accused of, you know, people assume that you got there [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=199.76s)]
*  not by earning it because of affirmative action. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=204.76s)]
*  Yeah. And it's it's a it's a pernicious even even in the best cases, it's pernicious. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPhY5ggQK08&t=212.0s)]
