# 'GAME ON': Trump border czar says ICE agents arresting 'worst of the worst'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ)
*  So ICE deportation operations have officially begun with a focus on immediate threats to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=0.0s)]
*  public safety. It comes as border state Arizona introduced their ICE Act, which would officially [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=4.8s)]
*  require the state to comply with ICE detainers, but the state's AG is speaking out against the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  president's plan. I also will not have any part of and will fight the attempt to set up what I [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=16.0s)]
*  believe are essentially concentration camps and family separation camps in the state of Arizona. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=25.52s)]
*  Here to explain it, all borders are Tom Homan. All right, Tom, listen, before I get to these [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=33.68s)]
*  Democratic AGs, can you give me the latest numbers on the border? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=38.24s)]
*  Absolutely. Look, the greatest president in my lifetime, he's back because in two days, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=44.64s)]
*  the last 24 hours, total apprehensions on the Southwest border, 766. Compare that to the 10 to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=49.36s)]
*  12,000 Biden had at one time. CBP, CBP1 releases zero. CHNV, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=56.4s)]
*  releases zero. Total of 766 across the entire Southwest border. That is a game changer. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=65.28s)]
*  And that is just some of the plans that have been implemented so far. Let's talk about the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=72.08s)]
*  22 governors, Democratic governors that plan on resisting, I'm sorry, the attorney generals that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=76.24s)]
*  are doing this. Tell me the legal authority that they have and the legal authority you guys have [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=81.19999999999999s)]
*  if they plan on resisting federal law. Look, I find it strange that the attorney general from [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=87.36s)]
*  Arizona makes such statements because there was a lawsuit in Arizona a few years ago. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=93.36s)]
*  The Show Me Your Papers lawsuit in Highest Courts of Land that said immigration enforcement [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=98.64s)]
*  in a federal responsibility, federal responsibility. She has no say in the matter. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=104.8s)]
*  And look, I've said many times, we said right out of the gate, Lawrence, right out of the gate, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=108.88s)]
*  we're going to concentrate on public safety. So she's saying that she doesn't want public [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  safety threats out of her community. Also, I'm insulted by the term concentration camps. Are you [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=117.2s)]
*  serious? You're comparing ICE agents. We just lost a board agent to a shooting up in Vermont [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  yesterday. And they're like, stop, are you serious? Concentration camps, ICE has detention centers. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  They have the best standards in the entire industry. I'll compare ICE detention standards [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=134.48s)]
*  to any state or federal facility or any county facility in the entire world. We have the highest [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=141.04s)]
*  detention standards. So that's an insult and it's a lie. Yeah, it is insulting to the agents, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=145.12s)]
*  the men and women that do the job. Let's talk about ICE visiting folks. Because when I look at it, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  I look at the law, people that have final deportation orders, people that are criminal aliens. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  What would a person have to do to get a visit from ICE? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  To be in the country illegally, first of all. I mean, there's nothing in the immigration law [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  says you got to be convicted of a serious crime to be removed under the INA. So if you're in the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=168.88s)]
*  country illegally, ICE can visit you. But right now, as we said repeatedly, and the President [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  Trump's been clear, we're concentrating on the worst first, the public safety threats and that's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=178.08s)]
*  security threats. And just yesterday in the last 24 hours, ICE arrested over 308, 308 serious [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=183.28s)]
*  criminals. Some of them were murders. Some of them were rapists. Some of them raped a child. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=190.56s)]
*  Some were sexual assault of a child. So ICE is doing their job and they're prioritizing just as [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=194.88s)]
*  the President said they would. So the ICE is performing excellent right now out in the field. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=200.16s)]
*  And they're going to continue every day. You know, Democrats loved you at one point. Now they don't [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=204.56s)]
*  like you so much, Tom. But back in the day, you served in the Obama administration as well. We had [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=209.6s)]
*  Jay Johnson on last week to talk about the border. This is what he said about you. Let's watch it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=215.6s)]
*  When I was in office as Secretary of DHS, I made no significant decision on enforcement policy [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  without having in the room Tom Homan, who worked for me, Kevin McAleenan, who went on to be acting [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=231.84s)]
*  secretary under Donald Trump, two pro-enforcement guys, and then two people on the other side of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=238.0s)]
*  the spectrum. So Tom, you've been doing this for a long time, amongst both administrations. You just [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=244.48s)]
*  want the border secure. I want to save lives. Secure border saves lives. And when President Trump [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=249.84s)]
*  locks this border down, less women and children be sex trafficking in this country. Less aliens [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=255.68s)]
*  will die making that journey. Under President Biden, we've had a record number of people die [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=260.88s)]
*  across that border. 600% increase in sex trafficking. And look at the quarter million [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=264.72s)]
*  young Americans dead from Fentanyl. We secured a border, the Fentanyl deaths have decreased. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=269.52000000000004s)]
*  Sex trafficking has decreased. Deaths on the border decreased. So it's just about saving lives. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  Secured borders save lives. And plus, look, you can't have strong national security if you don't [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=278.8s)]
*  have border security. We need to know who's coming in, what's coming in, where it's coming in, why it's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=284.16s)]
*  coming in. So again, President Trump, game changer, already made a significant difference on that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=287.92s)]
*  border. This country is already safer because of President Trump. I don't want to give the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=292.48s)]
*  criminals any type of leeway here so they can react toward this interview. But what's the next [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  move? What's the next option on the table to get more safety in this country? Well, DOD, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  they're going to assist us on the border. They already started on that plan. So we're going to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=310.48s)]
*  have some military on the border. We're going to continue building infrastructure. We're going to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=314.24s)]
*  continue building the wall. As far as interior enforcement, we're going to keep looking for the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  worst first. And look, the sanctuary cities, I've said this many times, let us into the jail [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=321.52s)]
*  where it's safer for an agent to arrest a bad guy. It's safer for the bad guy to be arrested in jail. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=326.64s)]
*  And it's safer for the community. When you release a public safety threat back into the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  community, that puts the community at great risk of crime. And it puts our officers at great risk, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=336.56s)]
*  because now they've got to arrest the bad guy in his turf who has access to who knows what weapons. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=341.84s)]
*  And it puts the public at risk. You know, for God's sakes, these sanctuary cities, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=346.16s)]
*  you know, let us into your jail. We're just trying to help public safety in your community, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=350.16s)]
*  help work with us, because you forced us into the community. Here's what's going to happen. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=354.88000000000005s)]
*  We'll find a bad guy, but when we find him, he's going to be with others, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=358.56s)]
*  others that may not be a criminal priority. But guess what? If they're in the United States of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  League, they're going to be arrested too. So sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  they don't want. More agents in the communities, more people arrested, more collateral is arrested. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=369.44000000000005s)]
*  So that's a game they want to play. Game on. You're echoing what Senator Thune said to the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=374.64s)]
*  Democrats. Either you guys can do this the easy way or you can do the hard way, but we're going [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=380.47999999999996s)]
*  to get the job done. Tom Holman, I can't wait to be out there in the field with you. Appreciate it, brother. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiiVMNud1xQ&t=384.08s)]
