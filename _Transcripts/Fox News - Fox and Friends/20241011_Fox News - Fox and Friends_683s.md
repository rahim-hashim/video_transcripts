# Obama makes stunning admission about Harris campaign
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM)
*  So let's talk politics now because the campaign hasn't stopped. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=0.0s)]
*  They're not talking about the hurricane, they're talking about the economy, and what it's going [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=2.84s)]
*  to take to win. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=6.2s)]
*  There's one thing that's pretty clear. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=7.2s)]
*  No matter who you think you're going to vote for on election day, there's a sense on the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=8.2s)]
*  Democratic side that they've lost momentum. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=12.88s)]
*  The sugar high is done, and the interviews have not helped Kamala Harris. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=14.64s)]
*  That all leads to why we saw Barack Obama yesterday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=19.0s)]
*  It's not a surprise to see the very talented and popular former president. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=21.52s)]
*  What is a surprise is the anger he showed yesterday, the vigorous way he went after [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=26.16s)]
*  the former president who could be the next president, and he was out and about. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=32.04s)]
*  This is him. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=37.2s)]
*  This is not the best audio, but here he is addressing young black men about what they [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=38.2s)]
*  see is a problem, and that is many are voting for Trump. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=42.96s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=46.92s)]
*  I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=55.800000000000004s)]
*  I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=65.8s)]
*  I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=70.8s)]
*  I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=75.8s)]
*  you have a choice that is this clear. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=82.8s)]
*  And on one hand you have somebody who grew up like you, knows you, went to college with [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=88.8s)]
*  you, understands the struggles and pain and joy that comes from those experiences. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=100.8s)]
*  So he's directing his interest. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=115.8s)]
*  In fact, he's kind of lecturing them. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=118.8s)]
*  Look, you've got to vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=120.8s)]
*  And in fact, during his big rally in Pittsburgh yesterday, he essentially said that she is [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=123.8s)]
*  the inheritor of the political movement that he started in 2008. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=128.8s)]
*  But that's part of the problem. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=133.8s)]
*  It's a lecture to black men. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=135.8s)]
*  It's not about about our economic circumstance. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=137.8s)]
*  It's not about how we view the border and people taking the jobs that would traditionally go. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=141.8s)]
*  I have a construction worker that I spoke to in a barbershop. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=146.8s)]
*  We're going to play the series very soon in Detroit. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=149.8s)]
*  And he said, I don't want to admit this, but when Donald Trump shut down the border, the wages [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=151.8s)]
*  were raised in my construction industry. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=157.8s)]
*  He said this on camera. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=159.8s)]
*  And he goes, on that issue alone, I had to give him a look. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=161.8s)]
*  And so what President, former President Barack Obama is speaking to emotion. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=165.8s)]
*  He's not speaking to the grievances of black men, which is why there is such a divide. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=170.8s)]
*  And I'm sorry, he has a lot of swagger. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=175.8s)]
*  He speaks candidly to the brothers. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=178.8s)]
*  But that's not enough to get a lot of them to support Kamala Harris. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=180.8s)]
*  He says that Kamala Harris hasn't had the same kind of energy as we saw when I was running. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=184.8s)]
*  He said that when I was running, which I agree with. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=189.8s)]
*  We all saw that. We lived through it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=191.8s)]
*  But then he says, he says, he, everyone has a choice that's so clean. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=193.8s)]
*  It's not. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=199.8s)]
*  You said it's not. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=200.8s)]
*  It's not so clean. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=201.8s)]
*  What is it that you think black men like about Donald Trump? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=202.8s)]
*  Well, they want to take care of their families. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=204.8s)]
*  And so if, if, if even the people that don't necessarily like Trump's personality, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=206.8s)]
*  everyone always says, well, I have more money in my pocket. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=212.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=216.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=217.8s)]
*  The grocery store prices were low. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=218.8s)]
*  I may not, not like the bombast when it comes to the border, but you know what? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=219.8s)]
*  It's getting out of control. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=224.8s)]
*  And those issues alone are enough to swing elections. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=226.8s)]
*  I'm not going to lie to you and say, hey, 80 percent of black men are going to vote for Donald Trump. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=230.8s)]
*  But if 30 to 35 percent of black men switched their affiliation to, to the Republican party, it's game over. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=234.8s)]
*  And Hispanic men, Hispanic men, it's a flat footed tie. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=242.8s)]
*  Hispanic community, it's within eight, nine points. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=245.8s)]
*  And keep in mind, Bill Clinton won Hispanics between 20 and 30. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=247.8s)]
*  Mitt Romney, who actually lived in Mexico for a while, lost it by, only had nine percent of the Hispanic, of the Hispanic vote. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=251.8s)]
*  So it's, it's certain things have certainly changed. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=259.8s)]
*  Sometimes when you look at this, don't you wonder why it's even close? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=262.8s)]
*  If you see the non, the white working class vote is gone heavily to him. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=265.8s)]
*  He's got more union votes than any Republican ever had. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=270.8s)]
*  I guess what he does not have is suburban white women. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=273.8s)]
*  If we were to continue to break it up by race and gender, he doesn't have that yet. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=276.8s)]
*  But I thought Eddie Griffin said something interesting. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=281.8s)]
*  And this story is on FoxNews.com. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=283.8s)]
*  He's relatively an X rated black, but very black comedians. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=284.8s)]
*  Very funny. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=287.8s)]
*  He says, watch your language here. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=288.8s)]
*  I know, please. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=290.8s)]
*  He says the black community goes, he offered a humorous argument that Trump has certain credentials the black community likes. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=291.8s)]
*  He's got three baby mamas, 43 felony cases and counting. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=297.8s)]
*  He's selling high top tennis shoes like Michael Jordan. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=301.8s)]
*  And he got shot like Tupac. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=303.8s)]
*  He goes, I'm voting for him. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=305.8s)]
*  He goes, I'm going to try. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=307.8s)]
*  He goes, I wouldn't be surprised if he dropped an album next. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=309.8s)]
*  I mean, I don't think the cold. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=312.8s)]
*  I mean, I think he's clearly making a joke. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=314.8s)]
*  He's having fun. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=316.8s)]
*  I don't think the community cares much about that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=317.8s)]
*  But I do think when they continue, the Democrats have to be very careful. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=320.8s)]
*  And if you notice, there was a huge surge of saying felon, felon, felon, felon. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=324.8s)]
*  Well, I thought the Democratic Party was for felons being able to vote and for a second chance. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=329.8s)]
*  And I think there's this double speak with the Democratic Party that's going to hurt them. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=335.8s)]
*  We don't care about the shoes and all that stuff. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=340.8s)]
*  We care about the money. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=342.8s)]
*  Do you know how many felons are in this country? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=343.8s)]
*  About 30 million. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=345.8s)]
*  And they came out and they have a spokesperson. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=346.8s)]
*  They said, can you stop with the felony talk? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=348.8s)]
*  Because we're trying to make a life of ourselves. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=350.8s)]
*  A lot of them feel they were only convicted like Trump feels. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=352.8s)]
*  Others say, I changed. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=355.8s)]
*  And if you keep on saying if you're a felon, you're a horrible person, I think it makes it harder for us. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=357.8s)]
*  Well, and we've been talking about a couple of different demographics. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=363.8s)]
*  But I know people who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 and they're going to vote for Trump this time. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=365.8s)]
*  And it all comes down to money. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=369.8s)]
*  It comes down to mortgages. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=371.8s)]
*  It comes down to groceries. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=373.8s)]
*  It comes down to they don't have as much money to buy stuff. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=374.8s)]
*  And what's interesting is, and I was talking to somebody yesterday who's in the financial world, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=379.8s)]
*  and they said, you know, are you watching the betting markets? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=383.8s)]
*  And I said, I looked at it about a week and a half ago. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=386.8s)]
*  And he said, what was it? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=389.8s)]
*  I said Kamala Harris was up. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=390.8s)]
*  He said it is completely reversed now. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=391.8s)]
*  Donald Trump is actually, and the betting market is where people actually bet their own money on who's going to win. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=393.8s)]
*  And Trump is way ahead. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=399.8s)]
*  And now he is ahead of her. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=400.8s)]
*  Ten days ago, two weeks ago, she was ahead. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=402.8s)]
*  But it's interesting. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=405.8s)]
*  And you look at the dynamic and it's like, OK, she's going to do all these interviews. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=406.8s)]
*  Well, she did a bunch of interviews, but she didn't say anything. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=409.8s)]
*  And the number one reason that people wanted to hear more from her was details. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=412.8s)]
*  And she that's that's a fatal error. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=417.8s)]
*  She has not given up any more detail. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=419.8s)]
*  There was nothing, you know, and as a woman, I want a woman to be president one day, but I want the right woman. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=421.8s)]
*  And I'm watching all these interviews with her. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=427.8s)]
*  They're softball interviews. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=428.8s)]
*  You would think that's when she would shine. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=429.8s)]
*  I was not impressed at all with anything she said. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=431.8s)]
*  I don't like Tim Walz's idea that you can have an abortion in month nine. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=434.8s)]
*  And if you if you're a parent, can you imagine getting rid of your baby when they're almost out of the wound and then he denies it? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=438.8s)]
*  She won't answer the question in the debate. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=445.8s)]
*  What is it? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=447.8s)]
*  Is it seven months? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=448.8s)]
*  Is it eight months? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=449.8s)]
*  Is it nine months? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=450.8s)]
*  She won't answer the question. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=451.8s)]
*  I understand women want to control their own bodies, but there need to need to be limits. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=452.8s)]
*  The first few months. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=456.8s)]
*  You know, maybe that's a conversation Republicans and Democrats can have, but not month nine. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=457.8s)]
*  We just want more details. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=461.8s)]
*  Here's the Wall Street Journal. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=462.8s)]
*  They say the lightness of being Kamala Harris, even in the interviews, Harris has had a hard time saying anything beyond package platitudes. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=463.8s)]
*  This may explain why the VP political momentum seems to have stalled. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=471.8s)]
*  Trump hasn't risen much in the polls, but Harris seems to have plateaued. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=475.8s)]
*  If you read the Democratic press, which means nearly all of the press, you'll notice a creeping concern this week that Trump is gaining in the polls. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=479.8s)]
*  Then the battleground states. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=486.8s)]
*  Democrats are worried suddenly and are few are starting to blame Harris for playing it safe with her version of Biden's 2020 basement campaign strategy. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=487.8s)]
*  They want her to define herself better with swing voters. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=498.8s)]
*  I think be more comfortable conversant with issues. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=501.8s)]
*  She seems to have memorized things. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=503.8s)]
*  When she stops at the end of a sentence, I feel as though there's a chance she'll never speak again. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=505.8s)]
*  It gets to a cliff. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=509.8s)]
*  Enjoy what is next. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=511.8s)]
*  And then when you have CBS 60 minutes fixing your answers at your one contentious interview, it's media malpractice. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=514.8s)]
*  Honestly, the way they did that, there's no way they would do that. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=521.8s)]
*  They need to explain. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=524.8s)]
*  They have to explain. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=525.8s)]
*  And if you don't believe it, it's not just the Wall Street Journal said, if you look at Axios report and talking about the internals within the Kamala Harris campaign, it is out of control. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=526.8s)]
*  They're worried about every single segment that used to be a healthy coalition for the Democratic Party. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=535.8s)]
*  And I'll say the last thing, this whole accent thing that she keeps doing, what was she thinking with Univision to change her accent in front of every single different group? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=541.8s)]
*  Then she had a Jamaican accent the other day when she was doing the late night show. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=550.8s)]
*  All this bouncing back and forth. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=555.8s)]
*  Just be real with people. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=557.8s)]
*  Sorry, that was the that was the gist of this entire article that we're just talking about because there was a line in there that says she hasn't shown us who she really is as a woman. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=559.8s)]
*  You don't know who she is. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=570.8s)]
*  She's trying to show it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=571.8s)]
*  She's manipulating herself. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=572.8s)]
*  She's a chameleon, depending on the group she's with. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=574.8s)]
*  She says, I wouldn't change anything. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=577.8s)]
*  I want to be the same person that I was under Joe Biden. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=580.8s)]
*  And this article says the biggest mistake was her response to what would you do differently than President Biden? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=583.8s)]
*  She says there's not a thing that comes to mind. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=587.8s)]
*  Who is she? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=590.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=591.8s)]
*  And the other part about that Wall Street Journal article is the truth that she has plateaued right now. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=592.8s)]
*  And that is why with I believe 25, 26 days left before the election, that's why they're rolling out Barack Obama. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=598.8s)]
*  That's why they're rolling out Bill Clinton. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=605.8s)]
*  It's like, OK, they are both going to try to drag her across the finish. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=607.8s)]
*  And that's why Walsh is now doing all these like he's meeting with Michael Strahan on the field at one of the stadiums. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=611.8s)]
*  He's talking to social media influencers and taking them pheasant hunting. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=616.8s)]
*  So he looks like a man's man doing a roundtable of local interviews to talk football and hunting with other local interviews. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=620.8s)]
*  I know we have too many deer. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=626.8s)]
*  Do we have too many pheasants to we do something you do with the royal family? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=627.8s)]
*  Right. Absolutely. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=632.8s)]
*  What's up with you in hunting this? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=633.8s)]
*  I just don't think that you like, OK, we got to go get pheasants. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=635.8s)]
*  It's like they're attacking us or hunting is like a sport that also provides food. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=639.8s)]
*  It's like you can go out and they run me dinner or Carly's trying to keep it together. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=646.8s)]
*  In South Carolina, we hunt deer and dove. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=651.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=654.8s)]
*  You chew doves? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=655.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=656.8s)]
*  They taste delicious. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=657.8s)]
*  Are they the peace animal? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=658.8s)]
*  No. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=659.8s)]
*  I know, right? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=660.8s)]
*  I know, but they are delicious. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=661.8s)]
*  You're thinking of the soap. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=662.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=664.8s)]
*  They're not the white doves. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=666.8s)]
*  They're different type of doves, I guess. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=667.8s)]
*  All right, look out pheasants. Tim Walz is coming. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxJBG19HKQM&t=669.8s)]
