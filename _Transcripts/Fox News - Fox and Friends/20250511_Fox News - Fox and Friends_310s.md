# Trump’s agenda in the Middle East is ‘peace and prosperity’: Energy secretary
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA)
*  Energy secretary Chris Wright joins us now. Mr. Secretary. So great to see you. Thank you for joining us. So [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=0.0s)]
*  What can we expect out of this trip? Do you think? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=6.2s)]
*  Think this is the president's agenda at home here. It's peace and prosperity in the United States [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  He has the same agenda for the Middle East peace and prosperity in that region. It's achievable [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=17.84s)]
*  It's in reach but it takes bold leadership and not the previous administration's sole focus on the biggest trouble maker in the region [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=23.48s)]
*  We're going to visit our allies [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  Very nice. So I also want to ask you about [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=33.8s)]
*  Something that's very near and dear to my heart, which is this whole concept, you know [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=38.24s)]
*  Obviously, you know the president has focused on drill baby drill and the importance of all of that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=42.64s)]
*  but the other thing that is really important and I think was a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=47.36s)]
*  Lesson from the first term was this whole idea of deregulation and in particular when it comes to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=51.0s)]
*  household appliances that the federal government gets so deeply involved in that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  Actually makes life, you know worse for citizens and makes everything cost so much more [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=65.4s)]
*  How is it the Trump administration trying to address some of these things? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=72.4s)]
*  Yeah, well laid out Charlie [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=76.44s)]
*  We have worked with the team here day and night to look at all the regulations put out by the DOE and tomorrow will announce [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  47 changes to regulations mostly just straight out elimination of regulations on everything from your [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  dishwasher to your stove to your washing machine [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=93.2s)]
*  Your microwave your and and and maybe biggest of all your showerhead. That's what my wife wants for Mother's Day a real shower again [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=96.4s)]
*  Yeah, and maybe for Father's Day [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  We could do we could get rid of all the regulations on gas cans this whole concept of making gas cans [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  Unusable and by the way more dangerous because the more features you put on a gas can [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=113.16s)]
*  When you go to fill up your chainsaw or whatever you end up spilling half the can all over the place [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we'll have to get to gas cans next this this our focus recently has been home appliances [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  But not only is it more than ten billion dollars of savings to American consumers [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=132.16000000000003s)]
*  It's endless joy of just better better [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=136.8s)]
*  Appliances and getting big brother out of your life [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=140.4s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, you know, obviously we have a lot of executive orders and there are a lot of things that you can do sort of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=143.36s)]
*  administratively within the energy department and you know, you we wonder well [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=149.36s)]
*  How can we make this stuff permanent and I kind of wonder why? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=154.96s)]
*  And I kind of wonder why Republicans in Congress don't wake up and realize that you could come up with actual laws [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=158.72s)]
*  Real legislation that says the federal government is not allowed to pass any sort of legislative [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  You know federal bureaucrats are not allowed to write laws write rules rather that that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=173.72s)]
*  Administrative rules that have the power of law that regulates how much water comes out of your toilet [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  How much water comes out of your bathroom or how you make a gas can or whatever [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=185.52s)]
*  Legislators in Congress could come up with laws like that and I think it would pass overwhelmingly because Democrats don't like this nonsense [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=191.5s)]
*  Yeah, the rains act is one such effort led by Mike Lee that would do just that just shrink the federal government back to the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=200.24s)]
*  It's originally intended goal. It was not to monitor how you live your life in your house or your apartment [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=207.12s)]
*  So agree a hundred percent we need to get as much reform done as we can in these years and I'm quite optimistic [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=212.56s)]
*  About what we're gonna get done. Very nice. So I've got to ask you about what's going on in Venezuela, right right now [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=218.8s)]
*  and in terms of the administration's posture towards in particular Chevron, but the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=226.88s)]
*  negotiations going on there to to prevent a Nicholas Maduro from [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=233.44s)]
*  You know getting advantage from [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=238.76s)]
*  Dealing with the United States companies [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=242.08s)]
*  Yes, I mean look this has been a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  25 year problem now Venezuela was a wealthy prosperous society in a great ally of the United States and a huge energy producer [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=248.68s)]
*  Then they adopted, you know, they had Hugo Chavez and now Nicholas Maduro to just awful tyrannical leaders [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=256.2s)]
*  President Trump wants to use United States force or energy independence to force a change in Venezuela [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=263.12s)]
*  Chevron's a great American company a little bit caught in the crossfire there [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=270.08s)]
*  But we need to change the situation in Venezuela not just for Venezuelans [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=273.88s)]
*  But for all the gang members and refugees fleeing that country and millions of them ending out in the United States [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=278.88s)]
*  But I think peace through strength is going to be the winning strategy here. Yeah [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=285.6s)]
*  Energy secretary Chris Wright. Thank you so much for joining us [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpoyLtv5iA&t=290.16s)]
