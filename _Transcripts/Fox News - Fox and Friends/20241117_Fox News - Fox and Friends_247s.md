# AOC called out for removing ‘she/her’ pronouns from her ‘X’ profile
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [November 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0)
*  All right, well it's time for another pop culture roundup Fox News contributor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=0.0s)]
*  Lisa Booth is here to help me break down all the latest stories. By the way, loving [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=3.94s)]
*  Lisa's hair. I keep telling her I love this length. Thank you so much. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=9.76s)]
*  All right, starting off with AOC. She has apparently removed her pronouns from [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=12.88s)]
*  her ex-profile and she also asked this. She wanted to ask her people why you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  voted for her and Trump. Watch. If you voted for Donald Trump and me or if you [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=24.32s)]
*  voted for Donald Trump and voted Democratic down ballot, I would really [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=33.22s)]
*  love to hear from you. Tell me what your thought process was. All right, well [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=39.88s)]
*  people said, by the way, she has 21 million followers on just Instagram and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=44.64s)]
*  Twitter combined so that's amazing. That's kind of a lot. Yeah. Well also if you [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  remember two years ago she put them up because her progressive followers were [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=53.44s)]
*  like, why don't you have pronouns in your bio? Look, I think the woke tide is over. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  Americans are tired of this pronoun nonsense, this transgender nonsense. If [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=61.44s)]
*  you look at the best ad that Donald Trump ran during the election cycle, it [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=66.08s)]
*  was Kamala Harris' For They Them. Donald Trump is for You. It was aired over [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=69.32s)]
*  15,000 times during NFL games in swing states. People are tired of this [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=73.12s)]
*  nonsense. It was effective. A single person cannot be a plural. Love her or hate her. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=77.64s)]
*  She is a populist which is why she got the Trump vote and the AOC vote in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=82.11999999999999s)]
*  her district and she is in touch with where the people are at. I actually am [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=87.36s)]
*  not going to criticize her. I think it's good for her to respond to what's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  happening in this trend. Although she did push some of that nonsense. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=95.05999999999999s)]
*  She did. She did. All right, let's talk about this. Rachel Zegler, she's the Snow [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=100.0s)]
*  White star. She had this profane post wishing Trump supporters no peace. Take a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=104.83999999999999s)]
*  look at that. She says, another four years of hatred. I'm here with you to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=111.36s)]
*  cry, to yell, to hug. May Trump supporters and Trump voters never know [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=116.24s)]
*  peace. That's her message. Disney apparently made her apologize for this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=120.48s)]
*  What do you think? Well, she should apologize. Also, what a liability to pick [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  someone who hates the original. That's the worst part of this. She's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=129.68s)]
*  insufferable. The entire time she's been making fun of the original, saying it's [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=133.84s)]
*  terrible. The reason people want to watch a remake is because they have nostalgia [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=137.52s)]
*  about the first movie. Of course. And then you have someone who hates it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=140.64s)]
*  Also, how disgraceful that part of the reason she slammed Trump supporters is [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  because she wants her future daughter to be able to get an abortion. So the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=148.2s)]
*  left and the media have convinced young women that aborting young, you know, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=151.2s)]
*  unborn babies is somehow freedom. Yeah, that's not very... She didn't like the Snow White. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=155.56s)]
*  Like, everyone wants a prince. Why not? Like, you know, like, so she hated that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=160.2s)]
*  Yeah, all of it. Also, I want to mention, Gina Carano, I don't think she should have to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=164.32s)]
*  apologize. I think everybody's free speech. I'm for Gina Carano was fired for [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=169.68s)]
*  making fun of pronouns. So that's interesting. All right. Martha Stewart [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=174.0s)]
*  pushes away touchy Drew Barrymore during an interview. Watch. I love this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=178.16s)]
*  Makes you soft and gooey, though. What makes me soft and gooey? Soft and gooey. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=185.36s)]
*  Yeah, what? Soft and gooey treatment. When you're treated like a lady. Nice. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  Someone someone comes in and you're the wrong gender. I know. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=196.0s)]
*  I was like, I feel like we're too far away. What if I just went and talked to you just like this? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=202.0s)]
*  No, but it's so wrong with her. But she's also the one that gave us the mamala nonsense. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  Do you remember that she said the country needs a mom. They need a mamala. She's weird. It's creepy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=211.92s)]
*  You want a mamala from a woman who never even had a child. So I don't know what that was about. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=216.64s)]
*  It's weird. It's super good for Martha Stewart. She gave her the the was it the Heisman? Yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=221.12s)]
*  The stiff arm and asserted her heterosexuality while she was at it. All right. Lisa Booth, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=226.0s)]
*  what's the big weekend show tonight? She's on. Yes. 7 p.m. Eastern. I did feel like we're too [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=231.28s)]
*  far away from each other earlier. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilme. And I'm Ainsley Earhart. And [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrBO6_am1P0&t=235.6s)]
