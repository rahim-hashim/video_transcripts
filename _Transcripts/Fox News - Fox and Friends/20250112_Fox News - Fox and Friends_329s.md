# 'HEALING': Statue of Mary survives California wildfires in 'perfect condition'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ)
*  Fox News alert the death toll rises to 16 across LA County and those returning home [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=0.0s)]
*  find their possessions left in ruins. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  And one California family is going viral singing in prayer after finding the only thing left [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=10.76s)]
*  standing on their property a statue of the Virgin Mary. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=17.02s)]
*  Raging a cherry, letare, alleluia, letare, alleluia, mia quene ruis di partale. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=21.52s)]
*  Jackie and Peter help and the owners of that Altadena property join us now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=43.68s)]
*  So describe for us what it was like when you went back to your property, everything is [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=48.78s)]
*  gone and what you find is that is that beautiful statue. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=54.24s)]
*  Okay, I'll go ahead and start. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=58.3s)]
*  But I need to warn you that it's very emotional for us so we may break down in tears while [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=62.86s)]
*  we're doing this interview. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=67.94s)]
*  We'll probably be there with you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=68.94s)]
*  First of all, let me say my bride and I are lifelong friends from junior high and we grew up in the little town of South Pasadena, just south of Altadena. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=73.78s)]
*  So we've been here all our lives. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=82.78s)]
*  My wife, there's a picture of our home before it burned down. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=87.06s)]
*  My wife, she was concerned about going up there because she didn't think she could do it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=91.22s)]
*  But it was it was healing for us to get onto our property. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=96.38s)]
*  And what happened there, we were so lucky we had to sneak up there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry to say we had to break the law to get back to our property. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=106.06s)]
*  But all our children who live in the area were able to join us there, our adult children and all those adult children combined, we have 14 grandchildren and one on the way. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=110.38s)]
*  But when we got up there, we all just stood around and it was remarkable that how everything had gotten fried. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=122.94s)]
*  But the statue of the Virgin Mary and another statue of St. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=129.66s)]
*  Joseph were in perfect condition. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=132.85999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, they were a little singed and we just took that opportunity to pray. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=136.3s)]
*  We are our home is dedicated to the sacred heart of Jesus and always has been and all my family members, my extended family. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=142.1s)]
*  So we set up a prayer to the sacred heart of Jesus. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=150.3s)]
*  And then we sang that special song that we've our entire family has known for decades to the Blessed Virgin. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=153.9s)]
*  And it was a remarkable thing. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=161.26000000000002s)]
*  Our intention was not for this thing to go viral at all. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=164.18s)]
*  It was it was pretty much just a family thing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=168.26s)]
*  But the response from the community has been unbelievable and and so heartfelt. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  You know, I have to tell you, I saw it brought tears to my eyes. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=178.78s)]
*  Regina Kelly, by the way, is the queen of heaven. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  It's a beloved 12th century Catholic hymn. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=184.45999999999998s)]
*  I just want to say, if my family sat around and sang it, it wouldn't sound like your family. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=187.82s)]
*  I was very impressed. I don't know where that comes from. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=192.9s)]
*  But but Jackie, just just tell me your thoughts on this, because I just think you've given so many people hope in this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=196.82s)]
*  Well, again, in your response to it, in your response to such tragedy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=206.9s)]
*  Right. Well, I when my daughter, my son in law, stuck up the day before and took a picture and that we could tell the statue was there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=212.18s)]
*  And I'll tell you, I when I saw that, I fell to my knees, not not in prayer, but in emotion. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=220.62s)]
*  And that's when I thought we have to get up there. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=228.58s)]
*  We just have to we have to thank God for the years that we had there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=230.9s)]
*  So that was my intention. We're going to we're going to pray. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=236.7s)]
*  We're going to thank God that we're safe. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  And we have entertained a lot for years. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=241.42s)]
*  We welcome we feel very strongly in the virtue of hospitality. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=245.18s)]
*  So I just wanted to pray and say, if we can do it again, that would be great. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=249.22s)]
*  And then the song kind of came about on its own. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=254.22s)]
*  So. Yeah, yeah, I just I just wanted to pray. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgylo4WlElQ&t=258.34s)]
