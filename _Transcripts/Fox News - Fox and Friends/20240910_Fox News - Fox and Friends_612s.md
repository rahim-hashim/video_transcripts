# Doocy: Kamala Harris has some explaining to do
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [September 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg)
*  with a look on how team Harris is preparing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey, Peter. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=3.2s)]
*  And Lawrence, Vice President Harris has some explaining [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=5.82s)]
*  to do if President Trump decides to go there. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  For example, there is this new questionnaire [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=12.68s)]
*  that she filled out in 2019, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=15.26s)]
*  where she talks about how she wants [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=16.92s)]
*  gender transition surgeries for migrants. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=18.46s)]
*  The exact quote is, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=21.3s)]
*  I support policies ensuring that federal prisoners [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=22.56s)]
*  and detainees are able to obtain medically necessary care [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=25.14s)]
*  for gender transition, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=28.84s)]
*  including surgical care while incarcerated or detained. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=29.98s)]
*  And then there's funding cuts to ICE. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=33.84s)]
*  Also in 2019, Harris wrote, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=36.08s)]
*  our immigration detention system is out of control. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=38.12s)]
*  And I believe we must end the unfair incarceration [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=40.8s)]
*  of thousands of individuals, families, and children. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=43.24s)]
*  I was one of the first senators [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=45.64s)]
*  after President Trump was elected [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=47.08s)]
*  to advocate for a decrease in funding to ICE. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=48.92s)]
*  The Harris Trump stand in the last couple of days [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  at debate camp, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  and Philippe Reines watched old Trump debates [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=55.72s)]
*  with the sound off to get Trump's mannerisms down. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=59.16s)]
*  And now in the mock debates, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=62.4s)]
*  he is dressing like Trump as well, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=63.74s)]
*  according to the New York Times. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  And they're practicing with these rules, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=67.48s)]
*  muted microphones, no live studio audience, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=69.72s)]
*  only a pen, a paper, and water on stage, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=73.1s)]
*  no pre-written notes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=75.52s)]
*  The answers are two minutes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=76.92s)]
*  The rebuttals are two minutes, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=78.24s)]
*  and the follow-ups are one minute. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=79.92s)]
*  I think he's gonna lie. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=83.36s)]
*  And he has a playbook that he has used in the past, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  be it his attacks on President Obama or Hillary Clinton. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  So we should expect that some of that might come out. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=97.28s)]
*  According to Politico, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=101.56s)]
*  the whole entire Harris debate strategy hinged [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=102.4s)]
*  on being able to fact check him in real time. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=105.56s)]
*  And when they have the mics muted, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=109.12s)]
*  she's not gonna be able to do that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=111.26s)]
*  So in Pittsburgh, they've apparently been trying [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=112.44s)]
*  to figure out how exactly she is supposed to debate [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=114.0s)]
*  when she cannot be jumping in. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=116.52s)]
*  But it's entirely a problem of their own making. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=118.64s)]
*  The Democratic staffers who are working [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=122.04s)]
*  for Vice President Harris now were working for Joe Biden. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=123.84s)]
*  They created these rules, they requested these rules, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=127.68s)]
*  and Trump agreed months ago to protect Joe Biden. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=130.24s)]
*  She is now bound by them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=133.76s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=135.48s)]
*  Hey, Peter, do we have any idea, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=136.7s)]
*  are they gonna come out and shake hands? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=139.1s)]
*  It doesn't seem like it, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  unless there is a spontaneous handshake, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  because everything is supposed to be the same. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  And so there was no handshake last time [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=150.0s)]
*  when it was Biden and Trump, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  and there was no handshake in Nashville [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=155.16s)]
*  or in Cleveland in 2020 because of COVID. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=158.64s)]
*  So the last handshake on stage of the debate like this [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  would be in 2016, Trump and Clinton. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=164.67999999999998s)]
*  Peter, media research says that Trump [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=168.76s)]
*  and Trump are very friendly. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  Because they were very friendly. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  You're right. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  Peter, the media research center is saying [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=175.72000000000003s)]
*  that David Muir's coverage on ABC of these two candidates, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=177.56s)]
*  the coverage of Kamala Harris has been 100% positive [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=181.52s)]
*  and of Donald Trump, 93% negative. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  Are you hearing any rules, any comments from ABC, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=188.28000000000003s)]
*  or how can we ensure that this will be fair? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=191.36s)]
*  It's really, I know that, I don't know. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=196.44000000000003s)]
*  I don't know exactly how the moderators are preparing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=200.68s)]
*  A lot like the candidates, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=202.52s)]
*  they are keeping their preparations quiet. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=204.4s)]
*  I know that Trump was really skeptical [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  going into the CNN debate, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  and he has had some friendly things to say [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  about Jake Tapper and Dana Bash afterwards. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  We just don't know. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=217.0s)]
*  And a lot of this will be up to Kamala Harris, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=217.84s)]
*  the things that she wants to bring up on stage, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=220.12s)]
*  and Donald Trump and the things that he wants to bring up, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=222.36s)]
*  how they respond and how the moderators either let them go [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  or just start cutting the mics. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  I can't wait. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  Great job, Peter. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  You know, there were a few times when Biden [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=233.16000000000003s)]
*  or Trump would talk, they'd put the mics up. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=234.0s)]
*  So even though they were supposed to be quiet, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  so like they'd be hearing something [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=238.52s)]
*  and you'd see the audio person's mic goes up. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=239.88000000000002s)]
*  And the one reason, the way the debate, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=242.36s)]
*  moderators will come in, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=244.76000000000002s)]
*  two minutes, two minutes is two minutes. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=246.32000000000002s)]
*  Whoever asks the questions, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=247.8s)]
*  if three quarters of the questions are about abortion, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=249.0s)]
*  then you're putting your hand on the scale. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=251.84s)]
*  If all of us on the economy, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=253.68s)]
*  if two thirds is on economy, you'd have to say, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=257.24s)]
*  well, it's because it's overwhelming, the number one issue. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=258.96s)]
*  But I worry about the two minute answers to questions [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=261.47999999999996s)]
*  and then the two minute rebuttals. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=264.12s)]
*  Then you have this one extra minute [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=266.0s)]
*  for follow ups, clarifications or responses. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=267.47999999999996s)]
*  That's when we find out if ABC wants to keep [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=270.2s)]
*  that perfect score going, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=273.24s)]
*  under 100% positive for Kamala Harris. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=274.76s)]
*  And then Trump has got to be ready for that mentally, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=278.56s)]
*  point it out and move, point it out and move. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=280.96s)]
*  Well, he also has to point to the big dump [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=283.52s)]
*  that was actually just put on in our report [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=286.16s)]
*  from CNN's K-File talking about [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=289.44s)]
*  her wanting to end all detentions, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=291.44s)]
*  taxpayer gender transitions for people that are here [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=294.92s)]
*  illegally and legally. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=298.24s)]
*  She wants to end ICE detainers with local police. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  She wants to decriminalize all drugs. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=303.88s)]
*  When was this done? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=306.24s)]
*  This was done in 2019. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=307.24s)]
*  It was a response to the ACLOU. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=308.92s)]
*  And they released a statement to the K-File, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=311.2s)]
*  this advisor didn't want to put their name on it, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=313.68s)]
*  didn't say who it was from. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  And this is what they said to the K-File, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=317.64s)]
*  the vice president's position has been shaped [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=319.12s)]
*  by three years of effective governance [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=321.28s)]
*  as part of the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  So on one hand, they have said, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=326.12s)]
*  she said publicly that she has not changed her positions. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=328.52s)]
*  Now the campaign is saying that it's been shaped [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=331.88s)]
*  by the administration. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=335.91999999999996s)]
*  So which one is it? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=337.32s)]
*  Has she changed or has she not changed? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=338.88s)]
*  I don't think this statement is gonna cut it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=341.76s)]
*  Well, it would be impossible for ABC [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=343.52s)]
*  not to address the flip-flops or policy changes [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=346.64s)]
*  or being pragmatic. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=349.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, they're gonna talk a little bit about that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  But there is such high risk but high reward [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=354.64s)]
*  on this particular event, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=358.35999999999996s)]
*  because there was one interview 10 days ago, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=360.2s)]
*  it was kind of a, yeah. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=363.12s)]
*  And now there's gonna be one debate that we know of. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=364.96s)]
*  And Bill McGurn writes today [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=367.88s)]
*  in the Wall Street Journal about this. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=370.68s)]
*  He says, on Tuesday night, that's tonight, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=372.44s)]
*  at the National Constitution Center in Philly, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=374.8s)]
*  Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump will have at it for 90 minutes. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=377.16s)]
*  Ironically, the low expectations for Ms. Harris [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=381.44s)]
*  may be an advantage. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=385.0s)]
*  All she has to do is not humiliate herself [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=386.6s)]
*  and her performance will be hailed as a triumph. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=389.84s)]
*  If the press corps did its job, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=392.4s)]
*  we'd all know more about what we need to know [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=394.08s)]
*  about Kamala Harris and what kind of president she'd make. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=396.28s)]
*  But because it won't, it's all on Donald Trump [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=399.4s)]
*  to do that job himself. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=401.72s)]
*  So the question is, and Peter was trying to forecast [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=403.24s)]
*  what it's gonna be like, if the mics are closed, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=407.12s)]
*  how does he respond to the questions [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=410.0s)]
*  that perhaps they don't ask from the podium? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  Because the other component is the fact [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  that over the last 72 hours, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=419.72s)]
*  all of her surrogates have lowered the bar. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=422.64s)]
*  They're saying, look, Donald Trump's done seven of these. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=424.92s)]
*  This is her first. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=427.44s)]
*  Essentially, he's the greatest presidential debater ever. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=429.1s)]
*  So all she's gonna do is not humiliate herself [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=432.90000000000003s)]
*  and people are gonna go, hey, that was great. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=436.18s)]
*  Well, Bill McGurn goes on to say that these reporters [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=438.3s)]
*  haven't been asking her questions about her policies. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=440.90000000000003s)]
*  He says that reporters haven't insisted [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=444.70000000000005s)]
*  that Ms. Harris answer just basic questions. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=446.54s)]
*  So the debate tonight might provide the only moment [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=448.76000000000005s)]
*  in this election when Americans get to see [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  how she performs under pressure. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  She won't be able to take notes in there. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=455.66s)]
*  They're gonna have to ask her about her flip-flops. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=458.0s)]
*  Will she have the word salads? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=460.04s)]
*  I mean, she's been preparing. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=461.48s)]
*  And the guy that's standing in for President Trump, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=462.64s)]
*  you saw that picture of him, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=465.2s)]
*  he says he's watched 15 Republican debates [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=466.52s)]
*  with Donald Trump. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=469.12s)]
*  He's watched the first time each debate the whole way through, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=470.16s)]
*  the second time focusing entirely on the exchanges [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=474.12s)]
*  that he was part of, and then the third time [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=476.74s)]
*  with the sound off to watch Donald Trump's mannerisms. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=478.64s)]
*  Right, good luck with that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=481.24s)]
*  So I love the first story in the New York Times today. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=482.48s)]
*  As the debate looms, Trump now facing questions [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=485.56s)]
*  about his age and capacity. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=488.32s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=489.79999999999995s)]
*  Okay, that's it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=490.67999999999995s)]
*  They say, well, sometimes when he gets remarks [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=491.52s)]
*  and give answers to questions, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=493.91999999999996s)]
*  he gets, he's not as clear as he could be, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  and they say that he misspoke a couple of times [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=498.32s)]
*  saying Obama instead of Biden. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=500.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=502.56s)]
*  A woman who really defines the word word salad [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=503.7s)]
*  is his opponent. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=506.08s)]
*  She's given the same speech 25 times, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=507.12s)]
*  and they say, well, she doesn't have that problem. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=509.15999999999997s)]
*  By prompter. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=510.88s)]
*  I mean, I've spoken to Judge Joe Brown over the weekend [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  who's been dealing with her for 20 years [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=513.9599999999999s)]
*  and say that she gets so lost in some of her answers, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=515.4799999999999s)]
*  sometimes she thinks she's at the early onset of dementia [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=518.54s)]
*  and that she's a total fraud. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=521.88s)]
*  Here's the one worry that they have. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=523.76s)]
*  When you look at the breakdown, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=525.4399999999999s)]
*  she's doing better than Joe Biden. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=526.68s)]
*  That's what everyone thinks. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=527.92s)]
*  But when you look at the breakdown [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=529.14s)]
*  of where Trump is doing better, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=530.36s)]
*  it's with older working class men. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=532.0s)]
*  Joe Biden actually had a lead on Trump on that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=535.16s)]
*  And now she's got, Trump has a six point lead on her on that. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=537.76s)]
*  So now she's got to reassure seniors in America [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=542.36s)]
*  that she's got that help. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=545.4s)]
*  And people that are typically a part [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=546.24s)]
*  of the Democratic firewall have said [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  they don't know who she is. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=551.8000000000001s)]
*  They don't know anything about her. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=553.64s)]
*  And that's a problem. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=555.48s)]
*  You have minority voters that are saying that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=556.32s)]
*  You're having women voters that are saying the same thing. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=558.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, we're 60 days out. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=562.34s)]
*  We know what spices she likes. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=563.44s)]
*  That's exactly it, but we don't know. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=565.0s)]
*  It's almost like the Masked Singer. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=566.48s)]
*  You don't really know who it is until the end. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=568.04s)]
*  We gotta find out who it is until the end. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=570.12s)]
*  I got a feeling she's going to present [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=572.4s)]
*  a new and improved Kamala Harris. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=574.32s)]
*  Based on? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=576.64s)]
*  Based on new stuff to win, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=577.96s)]
*  according to what we've heard. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=579.8s)]
*  And Bernie Sanders. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=581.0s)]
*  So Bernie Sanders says she's being pragmatic. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=581.96s)]
*  She's saying anything she can to win. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QQrAEOOSg&t=585.2s)]
