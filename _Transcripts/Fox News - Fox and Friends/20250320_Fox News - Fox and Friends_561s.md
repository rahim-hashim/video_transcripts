# Trump slams Dems supporting Palestinian protester facing deportation: 'Stupidity!'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo)
*  A hearing set for anti-Israel activist Mahmoud Khalil in Louisiana tomorrow over his deportation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=0.0s)]
*  It comes as the judge rules to move his separate detainment case to very blue New Jersey. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=7.2s)]
*  Todd Pyro is here with more. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=12.92s)]
*  Hey Todd. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=14.6s)]
*  Hey guys, good morning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=15.6s)]
*  Former Columbia University grad student Mahmoud Khalil's removal hearing has been moved to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=16.6s)]
*  tomorrow in Louisiana to determine if he can be legally deported. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=20.48s)]
*  Now this is separate from a federal judge's decision yesterday to transfer his detention [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=24.72s)]
*  hearing to New Jersey, not Louisiana, where he's currently being held. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=29.24s)]
*  The judge citing a law that required the case be held in the same jurisdiction where Khalil [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=33.68s)]
*  was first held, which of course is New Jersey. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=38.16s)]
*  The judge also denying the Trump administration's request to dismiss Khalil's challenge to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=41.08s)]
*  his arrest. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=45.8s)]
*  Trump doubling down on his decision though to remove Khalil. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=47.08s)]
*  Well Khalil's not exactly an easy one either because it's some judge, you know, glommed [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=51.4s)]
*  on to him. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  Democrats lost big because of the stupidity of, you know, they're backing these 90% negative [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=58.52s)]
*  things from their standpoint. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  People that hate Israel want to destroy it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=66.28s)]
*  People that are murderers, people that are horrible. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=68.92s)]
*  Khalil releasing a letter from an ICE detention center in Louisiana, quote, the Trump administration [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=72.36s)]
*  is targeting me as part of a broader strategy to suppress dissent. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  Visa holders, green card carriers and citizens alike will all be targeted for their political [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=81.48s)]
*  beliefs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=86.88s)]
*  In the weeks ahead, students, advocates and elected officials must unite to defend the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=87.88s)]
*  right to protest, end quote. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  Khalil is a lawful permanent resident, aka a green card holder, who helped lead Columbia [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=94.52s)]
*  University's anti-Israel protests last spring. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=99.6s)]
*  He was arrested by federal immigration authorities earlier this month, expected to remain in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=102.64s)]
*  Louisiana until that New Jersey judge weighs it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=107.36s)]
*  Back over to you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  So Todd, as a lawyer, since he is a green card holder, that makes him an American citizen [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  essentially. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  What is the process for deporting somebody like that? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  Again, this is all going to come down to a battle of whose view of the law ultimately [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=120.64s)]
*  wins out. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=127.56s)]
*  And the Trump administration is saying, look, under the laws of deportation, if you do anything [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=128.56s)]
*  as a green card holder that violates any of the tenants that Marco Rubio, the secretary [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=134.36s)]
*  of state, lays out as a precondition for being here, then he can remove you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, on the other side, they're going to make the more you have all the rights of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=143.84s)]
*  the citizens. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=147.56s)]
*  And that's what Khalil's lawyers are going to put forth. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=149.4s)]
*  It's going to be interesting. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=152.22s)]
*  And again, I say this all the time for all these cases. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=153.22s)]
*  The Supreme Court ultimately is going to have to decide this because I don't think the law [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=156.36s)]
*  is 100% clear on this point. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=159.24s)]
*  And I think this is where you're going to get the new case law. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=162.08s)]
*  And that's why I view this case, Steve, really as a trial balloon. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=164.88s)]
*  I think the people supporting Khalil know exactly what they're doing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=168.6s)]
*  Trump knows exactly what he's doing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  This is going to come down to those nine justices in robes in the Supreme Court. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  Thanks, Todd. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=177.68s)]
*  I love what Marco Rubio said. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=178.18s)]
*  Marco Rubio said if he said, hey, I'm pro-Palestinian, I'm pro-Hamas, I'd like to come to Columbia, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  go to school and create unrest, he wouldn't have gotten in. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=184.68s)]
*  So you lied. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=186.96s)]
*  You came in here as a student, you had an agenda, an older student. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=188.14000000000001s)]
*  How you got into Columbia, I don't get. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=192.18s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=194.08s)]
*  I'm looking up the judge from New Jersey because he's the one that's going to hear this case. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=195.08s)]
*  His name is Michael Farberz. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=198.56s)]
*  I think that's how you pronounce it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=202.56s)]
*  It says he went to Columbia. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=204.1s)]
*  Well, there you go. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  He taught courses at Columbia Law School and New York University School of Law. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=206.84s)]
*  The bottom line is this guy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=211.32s)]
*  Education, sorry, Lawrence. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=213.76s)]
*  Education at Harvard and at Yale. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=214.76s)]
*  So Ivy League. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  No, this guy doesn't care about our country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  He's trying to bring discourse to our country. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=219.2s)]
*  Khalil. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=222.83999999999997s)]
*  It's a big problem. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  The thing that people are missing is there's a Khalil on most college campuses, every single [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=225.16s)]
*  one of them, that are starting these protests. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=230.04s)]
*  They have direct connections with Hamas. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  They want to tear up the foundation and we're letting it happen. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  It is a privilege to be in this country if you're on a green card or a visa. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=238.67999999999998s)]
*  And what the Secretary of State is saying, I control the process. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=242.68s)]
*  And you have violated, you lied to the American people, you lied to our offices, and I'm revoking [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=245.92s)]
*  it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=250.44s)]
*  And what they're going to set this up for everyone that has a visa or a green card that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=251.44s)]
*  gets denied, now they're going to want a judge to get involved with it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=255.64s)]
*  And we can't allow that to happen. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=259.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=261.12s)]
*  You know what? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=262.12s)]
*  I said he's a green card holder. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=263.12s)]
*  And actually, he's not a citizen, but he can apply for citizenship through the normal [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=264.2s)]
*  process. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  What he's trying to do is he's trying to make it a First Amendment issue, as opposed to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  whether the authority of the federal government to deport people who are in this country at [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=273.2s)]
*  the invitation of the United States. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=278.36s)]
*  I believe our United States government should be able to revoke a visa for any reason. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=279.36s)]
*  For any reason. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=283.16s)]
*  You're not a citizen of this country. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=284.64s)]
*  It's a privilege. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=287.8s)]
*  It shouldn't, they shouldn't have to justify protecting this country. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=288.8s)]
*  It shouldn't happen. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=292.56s)]
*  So let's see what happens. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=294.0s)]
*  Gotta go. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=295.0s)]
*  Carly, the case of anti-Israel protester Mahmoud Khalil makes its way to a Louisiana courtroom [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=296.0s)]
*  tomorrow for his removal hearing after a judge in his detention hearing moved that case to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=300.64s)]
*  Blue State, New Jersey instead of Louisiana. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=306.0s)]
*  Denise Cohen's an attorney and Columbia University alum. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=308.92s)]
*  She joins me now just for the audience at home. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=312.28s)]
*  These are two separate hearings, detention and removal. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=314.0s)]
*  Tomorrow's removal hearing, though, I think is the big one because that will determine [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  if he is legally deportable. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=321.44s)]
*  How do you think the court should rule? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=324.24s)]
*  Well how they should rule and how they will rule. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=326.0s)]
*  You can answer both. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=328.12s)]
*  Very different. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=329.12s)]
*  I think they will probably rule that he is not deportable at this point, that they will [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=330.12s)]
*  say that the arrest or the detention was not legal. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=334.12s)]
*  They'll find a reason for it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=338.36s)]
*  But the truth is his behavior falls exactly within the definition of what would make him [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=339.96s)]
*  deportable. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=345.48s)]
*  The same standards that should have probably prevented him from getting a student visa [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=347.8s)]
*  would be the same that would enable him to be deported. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=352.56s)]
*  These are things like passing out pamphlets that are associated with Hamas, a terrorist [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=356.12s)]
*  organization, leading student activities to take over buildings. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  All of this behavior is not in line with getting a green card or staying in the United States. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=365.40000000000003s)]
*  Let's broaden this out, though, from this one case to so many of the individuals that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=372.16s)]
*  we've seen at your alma mater. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=376.88s)]
*  Do you think that these kind of hearings should be held for more than just Mahmoud Khalil? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=379.23999999999995s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=385.44s)]
*  And part of the problem with it just being him right now is he's becoming a martyr for [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=386.44s)]
*  First Amendment protections. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=391.64s)]
*  And this has nothing to do with the First Amendment. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=393.55999999999995s)]
*  There are so many people that have been involved with this that have allowed other students [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=395.88s)]
*  to be harassed and not go to classes and just turn what used to be a beautiful campus into [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=399.96s)]
*  complete chaos. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=404.44s)]
*  So there are a lot of people that ought to be held accountable for this. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=405.44s)]
*  Here's the president weighing in on this case last night. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=408.68s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=410.84s)]
*  Well, Khalil's not exactly an easy one either because some judge, you know, glommed on to [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=411.84s)]
*  him. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=419.6s)]
*  But the Democrats lost big because of the stupidity of, you know, they're backing these [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=420.6s)]
*  90 percent negative things from their standpoint. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=424.32s)]
*  People that hate Israel want to destroy it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=428.04s)]
*  People that are murderers, people that are horrible. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=430.68s)]
*  We went through the legal reaction. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=434.24s)]
*  I asked you those questions, but now your reaction just as an alum, as a human. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=435.68s)]
*  My reaction to what Trump said and just these overall protests. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=440.4s)]
*  I as an American, as a Jewish woman, as a New Yorker, as an alum, I'm extremely grateful [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=444.32s)]
*  that he's taking this position. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=449.62s)]
*  It was horrible to have to sit back and watch this rise to the levels that it had risen [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=450.91999999999996s)]
*  to. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=455.32s)]
*  And it didn't need to get here. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=456.32s)]
*  Had Columbia did something like what NYU had done in the early days where they actually [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=457.32s)]
*  got brought in the NYPD and they worked in collaboration with them. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=461.68s)]
*  So it was a very safe place to be. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=465.08s)]
*  My own niece, Hannah, was actually at NYU at the time and she had no problems. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=466.72s)]
*  If Columbia had done that, we wouldn't be facing the situation today. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=470.76s)]
*  And these students would not be facing deportation. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=474.08s)]
*  And I think it underscores the fact that it can be done if you have the will within your [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=476.6s)]
*  institution. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=481.52s)]
*  If not, this happens. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=482.52s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reporting Columbia is close to giving in to President Trump's [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=484.04s)]
*  demands in order to make sure they don't lose that $400 million in federal funding. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=487.76s)]
*  But again, it comes back to this question. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=493.32s)]
*  Why did it have to come down to the threat of losing all this federal money for a school [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=495.12s)]
*  like Columbia to just do the right thing? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=499.92s)]
*  It is really complicated to answer that question. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=504.08s)]
*  I'm not there, but I do. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=506.36s)]
*  I will tell you that the professors had a very pro-Arab, anti-Israel bent when I was [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=507.44s)]
*  there and I got my degree from the same school, the SIPA, from the Middle East Institute. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=512.52s)]
*  And I was shocked with the way that they were presenting the history of the Middle East. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=517.32s)]
*  It was very different to anything that I had learned outside. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=520.6400000000001s)]
*  So there is this inclination to be very supportive of, say, Palestinian rights. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=524.2s)]
*  But Palestinian rights are not the same as being pro-Khamas, and that's where this is [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=529.1600000000001s)]
*  gone. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=533.0s)]
*  It got completely out of hand. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=535.0s)]
*  And I think that if there's weakness, whenever you have weakness in leadership, people take [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=536.1600000000001s)]
*  over. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=539.96s)]
*  And that's what's happened. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=540.96s)]
*  It's like when water finds a way to make it through a crack. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=541.96s)]
*  That's basically what happened here, and the cracks in Columbia are being exposed. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=544.08s)]
*  Denise Cohen, thank you for your time and your insight. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNe8eCPMTo&t=547.48s)]
