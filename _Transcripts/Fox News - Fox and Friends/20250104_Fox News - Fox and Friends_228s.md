# ‘START MOVING POLICY’: McCarthy urges new Congress to take action
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8)
*  Well, our next guest knows more about this critical process than probably anyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=0.0s)]
*  Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy joins us now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=4.68s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, it's good to see you again. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=6.96s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=10.16s)]
*  Happy New Year. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=11.16s)]
*  Happy New Year. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=12.16s)]
*  Are you surprised that they got this done in one round? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=13.16s)]
*  No. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=17.04s)]
*  Congratulations first to Speaker Johnson. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=19.44s)]
*  Well done. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=20.8s)]
*  But I think having such a big election and real congratulations to President Trump, I [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=21.8s)]
*  He made the difference here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=28.04s)]
*  He united a conference that is tough to keep together. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=30.56s)]
*  Now we won across the country, but Congress, the majority shrunk a little. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  And it's even going to get smaller by two more as they go to the administration. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=37.48s)]
*  So nobody can have a disagreement if we want to get this agenda through. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=42.54s)]
*  And the American people have spoke loud and clear. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=47.0s)]
*  And I think President Trump is the unifier. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Members have got to stop focusing on themselves and look to the policy. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=52.4s)]
*  And actually, when we had our challenges in the last Congress, once we got through that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=56.96s)]
*  speaker vote, those first nine months were our most productive months. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  We passed most of the most significant bills from border security, keeping parents in charge [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=64.76s)]
*  of the education system, doing our energy policy. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=70.2s)]
*  That's really, you're coming off a wind now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=75.2s)]
*  So we need to identify around that and start moving policy for the American first with [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=79.04s)]
*  the president needs to sign. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  Now, you guys famously passed H.R. 2 on immigration, right, in the last Congress, then it ran right [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  into that brick wall in Chuck Schumer's Senate. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  It's not going to be Chuck Schumer's Senate anymore in this new year and this new Congress. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=92.4s)]
*  Republicans will have the majority in each chamber, Mr. Speaker. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  So how does that change things in terms of what can realistically get done? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=100.0s)]
*  Although there is still that filibuster in the Senate, I know that there are some ways [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  around that on reconciliation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=107.64s)]
*  What do you expect to see in terms of the timeline here? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=109.52s)]
*  Well, the first thing you've got to realize in modern history, this is the first time [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=112.28s)]
*  the majority in the Senate is larger than the majority in the House. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=117.0s)]
*  Normally, the House majorities are much bigger than the Senate. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=120.96s)]
*  So the Senate has much more power. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=123.84s)]
*  And because you have the House and Senate and presidency, the reconciliation is very [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  important with that tax policy, with immigration and others. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=130.16s)]
*  So don't have a few members fighting. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=134.12s)]
*  You've got to find that what unifies people is keeping the promise. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=136.76000000000002s)]
*  If you want to keep this majority, if you want to govern in the right direction, focus [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=141.44s)]
*  on the policy, which they did yesterday, focusing with the president bringing them together. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=145.28s)]
*  I think early on, you're going to see bills come through dealing with the border. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  The president is going to be better prepared than he was the first time he became president. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  You're going to see from the very first day, he'd taking actions to make sure bringing [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=158.84s)]
*  back the failures of Joe Biden, making America stronger. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=163.12s)]
*  But Congress is going to have to be the driver that moves it to the Senate. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=166.8s)]
*  And I think you're going to see the Senate very united to be able to move this legislation. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=170.44000000000003s)]
*  The first thing they have to do, though, is confirm that cabinet. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=174.52s)]
*  And the president's better prepared. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=178.0s)]
*  He has the names there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  I think you're going to see all of them get confirmed to move forward. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=181.28s)]
*  The only challenge they really have is they didn't finish the job from the last Congress. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=185.36s)]
*  You got to what, March 14th. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=189.24s)]
*  You got to deal with the last year funding, which is unfortunate for President Trump. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=191.16s)]
*  But let's get that done. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=195.5s)]
*  So we also could be focusing on what the president said in his campaign. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=196.68s)]
*  We promise we would do. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=200.62s)]
*  Well, you mentioned new Senate majority for the Republicans in the upper chamber, new [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=201.8s)]
*  leadership as well for Senate Republicans. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=205.72s)]
*  So a lot to keep in mind and keep an eye on here in the new year. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=208.44s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy, it's very good to see you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=212.84s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=214.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLOvRz5MK8&t=216.92000000000002s)]
