# IDF confirms killing of Hamas leader involved in Oct. 7 terror attack
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8)
*  A Fox News alert. Israeli forces say they have killed the Hamas commander who directed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=0.0s)]
*  some of the horrific terror attacks on Israel that took place on October 7th. You're watching [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=5.78s)]
*  Fox & Friends First here on a Tuesday. I'm Todd Pyron. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=10.68s)]
*  And I'm Carly Schimkes. Greg Palcott is live on the ground near Israel's northern border [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=13.0s)]
*  with Lebanon. But we begin with Jonathan Hunt in Jerusalem with the breaking news. Jonathan. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=17.96s)]
*  Carly and Todd, good morning to you. The Israeli Defense Forces clearly consider this to be [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=23.96s)]
*  one of the most significant gets since war was declared against Hamas following the horrific [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=29.12s)]
*  attacks of October the 7th. They say they took out Nassim Abu Adjina, a commander in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=36.12s)]
*  Hamas' northern brigades. They say that he was responsible for directing, as they put [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=43.4s)]
*  it, some of the attacks of October 7th, attacks that were launched from the northern part [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip. And significantly, they say, in taking out Nassim Abu Adjina, they [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=56.08s)]
*  believe they have significantly reduced Hamas' ability to disrupt the IDF's ground operations [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=62.4s)]
*  in the northern end of the Gaza Strip. So they clearly believe he was a very big player [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=70.52s)]
*  in Hamas' northern Gaza command. In the meantime, those ground operations continue. And what [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=76.84s)]
*  the IDF appears to be trying to do is encircle Gaza City up in the northern end of the Gaza [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=82.72s)]
*  Strip. They've gone down the western side, which would be the coastal side of Gaza. They [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=89.84s)]
*  are coming in from the north and east, and they appear to be trying to encircle the entirety [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=94.16s)]
*  of Gaza City and therefore squeeze the Hamas fighters back into the center of that city. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=100.72s)]
*  Then they will take them on, on the ground and in the tunnels. And we are hearing from [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=108.22s)]
*  the IDF this morning that that is indeed what they've been doing, striking hundreds [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=112.32s)]
*  of targets both above and below ground. The IDF also very relieved to announce just yesterday [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=116.83999999999999s)]
*  that they rescued one of their own, an IDF soldier who was kidnapped on October 7th, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  taken into Gaza, was rescued by IDF forces, and she is now reunited with her family. In [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=130.72s)]
*  the meantime, Prime Minister Netanyahu is saying there is absolutely no consideration being [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=138.6s)]
*  given by the Israeli government to a ceasefire, which has been called for by some parties. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=144.52s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu says that would be akin to the United States declaring a ceasefire [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  in the immediate wake of Pearl Harbor or the 9-11 attacks. The Prime Minister says this [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=155.84s)]
*  war will continue minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day until Israel achieves [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=161.6s)]
*  total victory. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  Carly and Todd? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=171.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. We're also learning that this particular commander who was killed is partly [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  responsible for Hamas's use of paragliders, and of course we all saw that imagery of the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=175.48s)]
*  Hamas fighters paragliding into Israel before launching their attack. So he is dead. That [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=180.4s)]
*  is significant. Jonathan Hunt, live on the ground for us in Jerusalem, thank you so much. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy5XL-urls8&t=185.44s)]
