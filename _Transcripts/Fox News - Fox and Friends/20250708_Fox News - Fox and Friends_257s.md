# White House sets record straight on tariffs, inflation: We 'hold all the cards'
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA)
*  Brand new data from the White House Council of Economic Advisers shows the price of imported [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=0.0s)]
*  goods are not only going down since President Trump began his new tariffs, they're actually [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=7.2s)]
*  falling faster than the price of goods overall. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=13.24s)]
*  Now President Trump is doubling down, announcing new tariffs on over a dozen countries, set [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=17.76s)]
*  to go into effect August 1st. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  Joining us now to discuss these developments is White House Council of Economic Advisers [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=25.76s)]
*  Chairman Steve Myron. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=29.66s)]
*  Thanks for joining us Steve. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=32.04s)]
*  So it is kind of remarkable to look at all of the experts who say that these tariffs [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=33.24s)]
*  are going to raise the price of everything and that's apparently not what's happening. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=40.28s)]
*  Good morning, thanks for having me. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly what's happening. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=47.08s)]
*  So in new work that our team has done, it'll be on the Council of Economic Advisers website [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=48.92s)]
*  You know what we did was we looked at in every category in the inflation index, we looked [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=54.36s)]
*  at how much of it is coming from imports, both whether the good itself is an import, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=59.68s)]
*  but also whether it uses intermediate goods, that is parts in between the raw product and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=64.12s)]
*  the finished product that come from abroad. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  And so we have a measure for each product in the index about how much of an import it [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=71.48s)]
*  is and what we find is exactly what you said before, that imported goods are actually getting [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=75.88s)]
*  cheaper while overall goods are getting more expensive. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=81.24s)]
*  And since December, so before the president took office, because tariffs started coming [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=84.64s)]
*  in January, the first day of January, sorry the first day of the president's term, he [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=89.1s)]
*  started with new tariffs, the price of overall goods has gone up by about 0.4% since December. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=93.08s)]
*  The price of imported goods has gone down by 0.1%. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=100.16s)]
*  So not only is there no evidence that the tariffs are leading to any economically significant [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=104.36s)]
*  inflation at all, but it seems if anything, the opposite is happening. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=108.64s)]
*  Can you explain for people who are not an economic expert why this is happening? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=112.44s)]
*  So part of the reason why it's happening is because the United States holds all the cards [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=118.84s)]
*  here, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  We have the leverage because we're the largest consumer market in the world, because we have [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  flexibility about who we can buy from, where we can choose to import from, or to make things [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=128.0s)]
*  domestically ourselves instead. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=133.08s)]
*  And that gives us the leverage to create a situation in which other people have to ultimately [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=135.4s)]
*  bear the burden of these tariffs. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=139.44s)]
*  And that's part of why what you're seeing in the data is that there's no inflation as [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  a result of these things. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=145.24s)]
*  There's no increase in consumer prices as a result of these tariffs. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=146.52s)]
*  And if anything, the situation is actually extremely benign. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=149.8s)]
*  So those who have been very concerned about tariffs have got it wrong again, just as they [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=152.8s)]
*  did in 2018-2019. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=156.9s)]
*  It is kind of remarkable to think about, you know, we often talk about the power of our [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=157.9s)]
*  military, but the power of our economy is probably the greatest weapon that we have. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=163.68s)]
*  What is on deck? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=169.24s)]
*  You know, we hear rumors of different deals coming down the pike, and obviously President [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=170.24s)]
*  Trump announced new threats of tariffs against countries if they don't make deals, even including [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=175.72s)]
*  against some of our best allies like Japan and South Korea. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  What can you tell us about what might be coming down the pike? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=190.0s)]
*  So the president knows these tariffs give us so much leverage because we do have the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=193.32s)]
*  largest consumer market in the world and because we can force others to ultimately accept the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=198.16s)]
*  cost of the tariffs. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=201.72s)]
*  And the president knows that, and that helps him, you know, procure concessions from other [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=203.16s)]
*  countries, which have already resulted in a few deals that have been great for America. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=208.4s)]
*  I would still be optimistic that we can see more deals before the end of the week. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=213.48s)]
*  However, it's incumbent upon the other countries to make the concessions that convince the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=217.8s)]
*  president that the deals are worth taking for America. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  Because otherwise, as you saw with the letters the president sent out yesterday, if these [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  countries don't step up and if they don't take steps to address the decades of grievously [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=227.88000000000002s)]
*  wide trade deficits the United States has run with them, then that's not enough to convince [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=234.8s)]
*  him. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=239.0s)]
*  And you get the letters with very high tariff rates as a result. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=240.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=242.44s)]
*  Steve Myron, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oIEjf_RA&t=243.44s)]
