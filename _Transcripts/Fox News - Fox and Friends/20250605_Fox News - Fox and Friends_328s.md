Video Description: President Donald Trump has signed a sweeping order blocking travel to the U.S. from nearly 20 countries identified as high-risk for terrorism, visa abuse and failure to share security information.
The new travel restrictions — announced under Executive Order 14161 — apply to nationals from 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia, Libya and Yemen, all deemed "very high risk" due to terrorist activity, weak or hostile governments, and high visa overstay rates. 
Seven more countries, including Venezuela, Cuba and Laos, face partial restrictions. #trump #politics #donaldtrump #immigration #foxnews

# NEW: Trump issues sweeping travel ban after Boulder terror attack
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA)
*  Straight to a Fox News alert in the wake of the Boulder Colorado terror attack. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump signing a sweeping order restricting travel to the United States from nearly 20 [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=7.4s)]
*  countries. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=13.16s)]
*  So nationals from 12 countries including Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia, Libya, Yemen are banned. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=14.16s)]
*  Individuals from seven more including Venezuela and Cuba face partial travel restrictions. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=19.04s)]
*  The White House says the move protects the homeland since those countries are high risk [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  for terrorism, visa abuse and they fail to share security information. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=28.04s)]
*  The strength of the restrictions we're applying depends on the severity of the threat posed [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=34.08s)]
*  and likewise new countries can be added as threats emerge around the world. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=40.48s)]
*  But we will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm and nothing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  will stop us from keeping America safe. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=52.04s)]
*  The president says the order is a direct result of the anti-Semitic terror attack in Boulder. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=56.28s)]
*  He was considering signing it beforehand but Sunday's assault put it in motion. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  Yep and this morning the Boulder terror suspect Mohammed Salomon is due in state court. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  16 counties facing of attempted first degree murder. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  It comes after a US district judge in Colorado issued an order temporarily blocking the deportation [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=75.08s)]
*  of his wife and five kids. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=82.12s)]
*  Judge appointed by Joe Biden, the family's lawyer comparing the Trump administration's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=84.8s)]
*  attempts to quote the methods of Nazi Germany. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=89.72s)]
*  So it comes after a dozen people were hurt at a march calling for the release of the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  Israeli hostages. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  I think this is just a fascinating move by the president. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  Something has to be done. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=103.2s)]
*  There used to be a program back after 9-11 called In Sears. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=104.92s)]
*  It was created actually by the now attorney general from Kansas. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=108.92s)]
*  And essentially this program, anytime somebody overstayed a visa and they were from an at-risk [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=114.16s)]
*  country it would send a notification to all the local cops to go get this person and bring [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  him into custody. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=124.8s)]
*  What happened to that program? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=125.8s)]
*  Barack Obama got rid of it because a lot of these civil rights groups, a lot of these [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=126.8s)]
*  Islamist groups called and they said it was too discriminatory. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=130.8s)]
*  And now this guy, if that program was still in place it would have alerted the local cops [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=134.6s)]
*  and him and his family would be in custody today. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=139.76s)]
*  Unfortunately they got rid of it because of wokeness and now as a result you got people [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=142.96s)]
*  that were set on fire. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=147.28s)]
*  Well, I mean he hates America. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=148.28s)]
*  He's yelling free Palestine. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  He's setting people on fire. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=152.88s)]
*  Y'all saw how big that flame was shooting at innocent people. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=154.56s)]
*  One of them was an 88 year old Holocaust survivor. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=158.84s)]
*  And now they're all fighting for their lives. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=161.62s)]
*  Some of them are still in the hospital. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=163.48s)]
*  One lady was severely burned. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=165.38s)]
*  He has a wife and he has five kids. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=167.62s)]
*  He said he wanted to wait until his oldest who's 18. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=169.48s)]
*  The others are minors. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=171.88s)]
*  Could go to college or could graduate high school actually. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=173.32s)]
*  Well he wasn't thinking about his family. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=176.72s)]
*  You know if you're here illegally and you commit a crime you're going to be on police's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=178.4s)]
*  radar. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=183.32s)]
*  You're going to be kicked out of the country and that's what Donald Trump is trying to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=184.32s)]
*  do. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=186.56s)]
*  It's common sense. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=187.56s)]
*  But then you have this liberal judge who says hold on we've got to do due process. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=188.56s)]
*  But this man put innocent lives at risk and his family at risk by doing this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=192.4s)]
*  I like the move. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=196.76s)]
*  I do think you have to have you have to have some scrutiny because I'll give you an example. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=198.04s)]
*  Luigi Mangione let's say he was a foreigner comes in he executes the CEO Brian Thompson. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=202.76s)]
*  There's no indication that his family is as deranged as him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=207.12s)]
*  So I just think immediately the family gets brought in for full investigation because [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=211.16s)]
*  this is terror. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=216.2s)]
*  This is foreign terror. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=217.6s)]
*  Here's Ken Cuccinelli former acting deputy DHS secretary. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=218.84s)]
*  The big struggle for this the most aggressive administration President Trump's second administration [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=224.26s)]
*  on dealing with this problem their biggest impediment are there too. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=229.94s)]
*  One is just logistics and building the pipeline big enough to find catch and remove these [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=235.28s)]
*  people but the other is the courts and there's so much due process in place. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=239.82s)]
*  And to me and so many other Americans if you break into this country effectively if you [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=246.5s)]
*  break our laws to be here you shouldn't get that benefit on the way out. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=251.98s)]
*  And that's really slowing the president down despite the fact that we now right now have [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=256.38s)]
*  the most aggressive administration since 9 11 in removing folks like this especially [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=262.46s)]
*  the ones who present even possible national security threats. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=268.74s)]
*  I think to Brian's point I guess the pushback I would say on that is that no one is saying [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=274.38s)]
*  right now that it's a criminal prosecution against the family. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=280.06s)]
*  What they're saying is that you've already overstayed your visa anyway. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=284.1s)]
*  You're not here legally. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=287.54s)]
*  They're here illegally. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=288.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=289.54s)]
*  If they're here illegally. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=290.54s)]
*  So is the family too? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=291.54s)]
*  Mangione's family. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=292.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=293.54s)]
*  They're Americans but this is a family I assume. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=294.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=297.02s)]
*  Since they were arrested and President Trump's deporting them they're not here legally. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=298.02s)]
*  No I understand. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=300.54s)]
*  They came with their dad. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=301.54s)]
*  I'm just saying this a lot of times you have crazy people in your family start committing [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=302.54s)]
*  crimes next thing you know you don't want to get in trouble but I know what you're saying [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=305.18s)]
*  about expedited removal because you got to figure we don't know their status but you [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=308.42s)]
*  got to figure if the dad has already overstayed their visa he brought his family you got to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=312.42s)]
*  figure they did it too. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6drRDE3UhA&t=316.78000000000003s)]
