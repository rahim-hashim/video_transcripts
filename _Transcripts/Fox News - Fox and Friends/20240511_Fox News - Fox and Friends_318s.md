# ‘SHAME ON YOU’: Ivy Leagues criticized for antisemitism, lack of law and order
**Fox News - Fox and Friends:** [May 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo)
*  You see amid all the madness, it seems the pro-America crowd is growing across campuses [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=0.0s)]
*  across the country as students are proudly standing up to anti-Israel activists. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=26.22s)]
*  Here to discuss is retired U.S. Marine Bomb Tech and Fox News contributor Joey Jones and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=31.02s)]
*  pro-Israel activist and journalist Emily Austin who is currently in Jerusalem. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=35.9s)]
*  Joey, you'll understand, we'll do ladies first here to start. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=40.54s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=44.379999999999995s)]
*  Emily, what do you make of the fact that you watch all this pro-Hamas terrorist love that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  students are standing up and saying, no, we don't want to be a part of that? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=52.18s)]
*  It's so refreshing to finally see the silent majority coming out because I can tell you [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=56.7s)]
*  as a Jewish student, as a Jew in general, it feels very isolating and lonely to be not [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=62.74s)]
*  only Jewish right now but pro-Israel and to see finally all of our friends and allies [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=67.32s)]
*  stepping up to what was very cleverly masked as anti-Israel rhetoric, which in reality [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=71.82s)]
*  pro-terrorism protests that they're doing now. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=78.66s)]
*  It's nice to see that the Americans are finally waking up, smelling the coffee and realizing, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  hey, we actually might be next here if we don't stop this chaos now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=88.62s)]
*  Yeah, Joey, it is heartening to see but we have to remind ourselves we're watching students [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=92.89999999999999s)]
*  hold up the American flag in America because other students are holding up other flags. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=97.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's insane to me. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=101.94s)]
*  We hear these stories every now and then of like an HOA saying, oh, you can't put that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=103.62s)]
*  American flag out there. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=106.74000000000001s)]
*  And we kind of just breeze by it, right? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=108.22s)]
*  We're like, man, thank God I don't live in that neighborhood until you do live in that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=109.58s)]
*  neighborhood. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=112.86s)]
*  And that's what they would have this country become, a place that looks at ourselves as [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=113.86s)]
*  colonizers and oppressors rather than the most prosperous country in the world specifically [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=116.62s)]
*  because we're the most diverse and the most patriotic. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=120.94s)]
*  Like if you speak different languages, pray different prayers, vote for different people, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  if the one thing that holds you together is the fact you love this country, that's a good [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=128.46s)]
*  thing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=132.9s)]
*  And if you use those things that tell people they shouldn't love this country, well, now [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=134.1s)]
*  you're using diversity as a weapon. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=137.38s)]
*  And that's what's happened is we've said, listen, if you exist on this intersectional [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=139.34s)]
*  pyramid of suffering anywhere but as a white male, you're actually being oppressed. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  So you should hurt the country. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=148.54000000000002s)]
*  You should hate the country that's hurting you. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=149.9s)]
*  That message is not only false, it's destructive. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=151.96s)]
*  And I tell you, you know, what do manipulators do? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=154.02s)]
*  They tell people how terrible they are. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=156.46s)]
*  They work their self-esteem down so they can take advantage of them. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=158.06s)]
*  That's exactly what this is. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  Hate your country, hate your past, hate what you stand for so I can tell you what you should [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  stand for. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=167.18s)]
*  You know, I went to Georgetown back in 2012, 13, 14. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=168.18s)]
*  It was after the Sandra Floch drama, but it was before any of this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=171.34s)]
*  I couldn't imagine sending my kid to one of these schools now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=174.78s)]
*  I mean, listen, if you send your child to one of these Ivy League schools that's not [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  only allowing this but kowtowing to it, shame on you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=181.9s)]
*  I mean, shame on you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=185.7s)]
*  My son can go to a technical college, a service school, or a community college. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=186.78s)]
*  That's all I have faith in right now. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=190.66s)]
*  That's a fair point. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=192.54s)]
*  Emily, do you think this is, is this a reflex, a snapback, or are these universities capable [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=193.54s)]
*  of a rebound, of actually embracing the country and rejecting this? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=198.78s)]
*  Because Joey raises a great point. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  I really feel like the leadership that's already failed has to step down for real change to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=204.5s)]
*  be made because now you've set a bad precedent. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=208.73999999999998s)]
*  As the president, let's use Columbia as an example, she's already shown students what [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=211.78s)]
*  they can get away with. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=215.98s)]
*  She's shown her lack of leadership. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=217.45999999999998s)]
*  She's shown that she can't address the root of the problem. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=219.45999999999998s)]
*  Rather than expel the students that are chanting pro-Hamas rhetoric on campuses, she'd rather [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=222.01999999999998s)]
*  waste the NYPD's precious time when there's plenty of crime all over Manhattan by staying [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=227.14s)]
*  on campus until May 17th to reinsure the Jewish students' safety and tell the Jewish students [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=232.26s)]
*  if you feel safer at home, stay home. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=237.82s)]
*  She would rather go that way than address the problem. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=240.06s)]
*  So when you have leadership that shows you how weak they are, the students already know [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=242.1s)]
*  exactly where the boundary is set. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=246.45999999999998s)]
*  They see the day with it and you can't have people like that in power. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=248.22s)]
*  That goes for mayors, politicians, universities, presidents. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=252.46s)]
*  So to see the real change, they need to step down and we need to put somebody who can keep [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=255.42s)]
*  their students in check and keep law in order, which is something the country's lacking greatly [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=259.14s)]
*  nowadays and then reinstate. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=263.86s)]
*  Joey, real quick, the frat boys have been the ones that have stepped up and said, we're [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=266.26s)]
*  not taking it anymore. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=270.38s)]
*  I know and I love the fact that people want to use that as an attack. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=271.38s)]
*  So let me tell you something, my brother-in-law is a frat boy that's been a fireman for 30 [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=273.74s)]
*  years. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=277.14s)]
*  I fought wars with frat boys. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=279.06s)]
*  It's not exactly the negative connotation people want to make it be. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=280.06s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=283.3s)]
*  The fact is on the right side of things, we usually aren't as loud and outraged because [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=284.3s)]
*  we have reason and common sense on our side and we don't understand the necessity of being [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=288.38s)]
*  loud and kind of stupid about things. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=292.41999999999996s)]
*  Unfortunately, that's what we have to do. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=295.14s)]
*  We have to show these administrators that are so weak and so cowardice that there's [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=296.7s)]
*  actually consequence to only kowtowing to the ones that are loudest. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=300.9s)]
*  So get on these frat boys. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=304.9s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=306.5s)]
*  Thank you very much, Joey. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=307.86s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=308.86s)]
*  By the way, Joey will be on the big weekend show. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=309.86s)]
*  Make sure you watch it tonight and tomorrow night, 7 p.m. Eastern Time, right here on [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=311.98s)]
*  the Fox News Channel. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=315.94s)]
*  We'll be watching. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=316.94s)]
*  Thanks, Joey. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7_JJLE1Yeo&t=317.94s)]
